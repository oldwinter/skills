# Building a Promotion Case

## Scope

**Covers**
- Turning “I want a promotion” into a concrete **promotion thesis** tied to company priorities
- Mapping your work to the **next-level expectations** (career ladder / competency model)
- Building an evidence-backed **impact log** (metrics + artifacts + stakeholder proof)
- Creating a **submission-ready promotion doc** (one-pager + appendix) that makes the decision easy
- Aligning with your manager using a **partnership loop** (a.k.a. “Magic Loop”) and planning the next 4–12 weeks
- Building a lightweight **sponsor/visibility plan** (political capital without being sleazy)

**When to use**
- “Help me write a promotion packet / promotion doc.”
- “I need a promotion case that maps to our career ladder.”
- “I want to get promoted this cycle—what should I do and how do I prove it?”
- “My manager says ‘keep doing what you’re doing’—I need crisp promotion criteria and a plan.”
- “I want to level up, but I’m not sure what evidence counts.”

**When NOT to use**
- You need compensation negotiation tactics for a new offer (this pack is about *internal promotion readiness*, not external offers)
- You are in an HR/performance escalation (PIP, investigation, termination risk) — involve HR/manager process first
- You don’t want to involve your manager at all (promotion decisions are manager- and org-mediated; this pack assumes partnership)
- You only need a resume/LinkedIn rewrite (use a resume-focused workflow instead)

## Inputs

**Minimum required**
- Your role + scope today (team, product area, what you own)
- Target level/role and timing (desired promo cycle/date)
- Your company’s leveling rubric / ladder (or a description of expectations if you can’t share the doc)
- 3–8 work examples from the last 6–12 months (projects, launches, decisions, cross-functional leadership)
- Evidence signals (metrics, customer outcomes, reliability, revenue/cost, quality, speed, adoption)
- Stakeholders involved (manager, partners, potential sponsors, promo committee style if known)

**Missing-info strategy**
- Ask up to 5 questions from [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md) (3–5 at a time).
- If the ladder/process is unclear, proceed with a **generic ladder mapping** and label assumptions for the user to correct.
- Don’t request confidential/PII; use anonymized numbers and redacted descriptions.

## Outputs (deliverables)

Produce a **Promotion Case Pack** (Markdown in-chat; or as files if requested) in this order:

1) **Promotion thesis + target role/timeline** (what you’re asking for, why now)
2) **Next-level expectations map** (ladder/competencies → what “good” looks like)
3) **Evidence log** (impact table with metrics + artifacts + stakeholders)
4) **Competency mapping** (claims → evidence; gaps → plan)
5) **Impact narrative** (1-page story + “company problem solved” framing)
6) **Manager alignment plan (“Magic Loop”)** (asks, commitments, check-ins, decision criteria)
7) **Sponsor/visibility map** (who needs to believe what; how you’ll socialize)
8) **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** (always)

## Workflow (8 steps)

### 1) Intake + promotion process snapshot
- **Inputs:** user context; [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md).
- **Actions:** Confirm the goal (promotion vs broader career planning). Capture timing, process, and decision-makers. Identify constraints (confidentiality, limited metrics, org politics).
- **Outputs:** Promotion context snapshot + assumptions/unknowns list.
- **Checks:** Target level and promo window are explicit; boundaries are respected.

### 2) Define the promotion thesis (make the decision easy)
- **Inputs:** company priorities; your work themes; target level expectations.
- **Actions:** Draft a 1–2 sentence thesis: *“Promote me to X because I already operate at X by doing Y which solves Z.”* Tie to a concrete company problem.
- **Outputs:** Promotion thesis + 3–5 proof points (bullets).
- **Checks:** Thesis is falsifiable and specific (not “I worked hard”).

### 3) Map next-level expectations (promotion ≠ career, but they should align)
- **Inputs:** ladder/rubric (or proxy); target role definition.
- **Actions:** Translate the ladder into a small set of competencies and “next-level signals.” Separate: (a) table stakes, (b) differentiators, (c) visibility/scope expectations.
- **Outputs:** Expectations map + initial gap list.
- **Checks:** Each competency has observable behaviors; gaps are concrete.

### 4) Build an evidence log (receipts, not vibes)
- **Inputs:** 3–8 work examples; available metrics; artifacts.
- **Actions:** Create an evidence table that captures: problem, your role, scope, decisions, outcomes, metrics/proxies, and partners. Identify where you need stakeholder quotes.
- **Outputs:** Evidence log + “evidence missing” list.
- **Checks:** Each major claim has at least 2 evidence types (metric/proxy + artifact/partner proof).

### 5) Convert evidence into a promotion doc draft (one-pager + appendix)
- **Inputs:** thesis, expectations map, evidence log.
- **Actions:** Draft the promo doc using the template. Write in exec-friendly language: impact, scope, leadership, leverage, and why you’re low-risk at the next level.
- **Outputs:** Promotion doc draft + appendix (evidence snippets).
- **Checks:** The doc is skimmable in 3 minutes; every claim has a pointer to evidence.

### 6) Manager alignment loop (“Magic Loop”) + criteria agreement
- **Inputs:** draft doc; manager context; promo process.
- **Actions:** Create a plan to align with your manager: ask what would make them confident, commit to what they ask, and schedule check-ins. Draft your “ask” script and the next 4–12 week plan.
- **Outputs:** Manager alignment plan + 1:1 agenda/script.
- **Checks:** Manager expectations are explicit; next check-in date is scheduled; you’ve made it easy to sponsor you.

### 7) Sponsor/visibility plan (politics as logistics)
- **Inputs:** stakeholder map; known promo committee dynamics.
- **Actions:** Identify 3–8 people whose belief matters. Plan how you will: (a) increase visibility of outcomes, (b) request feedback/endorsements, (c) avoid surprises.
- **Outputs:** Sponsor/visibility map + outreach templates.
- **Checks:** Every key stakeholder has a specific next action and a low-friction ask.

### 8) Quality gate + finalize
- **Inputs:** full pack draft.
- **Actions:** Run [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and score with [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md). Tighten weak sections. Add **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**. Produce a submission-ready doc and a short “manager email” version.
- **Outputs:** Final Promotion Case Pack.
- **Checks:** Pack is evidence-based, ladder-aligned, and process-ready; risks and unknowns are explicit.

## Quality gate (required)
- Use [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md).
- Always include: **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**.

## Examples

**Example 1 (typical):** “I’m a Senior PM and want to get promoted to Staff PM in the next cycle (May). Here’s our ladder excerpt and 5 projects I led. Build a promotion case doc + evidence log + manager alignment plan.”  
Expected: Promotion Case Pack with a ladder-mapped narrative and concrete manager check-ins.

**Example 2 (limited metrics):** “I’m a PM on an internal platform team. My impact is hard to measure. Help me build a promotion case using proxy metrics, stakeholder evidence, and artifacts.”  
Expected: Evidence log with proxies (cycle time, reliability, adoption, internal NPS) and explicit proof pointers.

**Boundary example:** “My manager refuses to discuss promotions and HR is involved in a performance process.”  
Response: recommend following HR/manager process first; offer to help later with evidence capture, role expectations, and a future readiness plan.
