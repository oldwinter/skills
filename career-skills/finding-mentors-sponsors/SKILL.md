# Finding Mentors & Sponsors

## Scope

**Covers**
- Clarifying what you actually need: **mentor** (advice) vs **sponsor** (bets political capital)
- Building a **portfolio** of mentors (not “one perfect oracle”)
- Identifying and prioritizing potential mentors/sponsors (internal + external) with a **warm-path plan**
- Writing outreach messages that are **honest, specific, and easy to say yes/no to**
- Running high-signal first conversations (agenda, questions, close, follow-up)
- Turning conversations into an **operating system** (cadence + value exchange + tracking)
- Optional: evaluating and selecting a **career coach** (interview multiple; pick for fit)

**When to use**
- “Help me find a mentor.”
- “I need a sponsor / advocate at work.”
- “Write outreach messages to reach out to potential mentors.”
- “How do I ask for mentorship without being awkward?”
- “I need a system to build relationships and get guidance for my career.”

**When NOT to use**
- You need therapy/mental-health support (use a licensed professional)
- You’re in an HR/performance escalation (PIP/investigation) where advice could be sensitive — follow the formal process first
- You only want a resume/LinkedIn rewrite (use a resume/job-search workflow)
- You want spammy mass outreach or “growth hacking” people — this pack assumes respectful, relationship-based asks

## Inputs

**Minimum required**
- Your current role/level + domain (e.g., “PM in B2B SaaS, 5 years experience”)
- The outcome you want in the next 3–6 months (promotion readiness, leadership growth, domain mastery, etc.)
- 2–4 skill gaps or problems you want help with
- Your constraints (time per week, confidentiality, internal vs external, comfort with outreach)
- Your current network starting point (at least 5 names or communities, even if weak ties)

**Missing-info strategy**
- Ask up to 5 questions from [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md) (3–5 at a time).
- If the user can’t share names, use anonymized placeholders and focus on targeting criteria + scripts.
- If context is thin, assume: early-to-mid career, seeking both internal and external relationships, and 1–2 hours/week available.

## Outputs (deliverables)

Produce a **Mentor & Sponsor Plan Pack** (Markdown in-chat; or as files if requested) in this order:

1) **Mentorship & Sponsorship brief** (goals, gaps, definitions, boundaries)
2) **Target list + warm-path map** (10–25 candidates, prioritized)
3) **Outreach pack** (mentor ask, sponsor/advocate ask, warm intro request, follow-ups)
4) **First-meeting pack** (30-min agenda, question bank, close + recap template)
5) **Relationship operating system** (cadence, value exchange plan, tracking table)
6) **Sponsor strategy** (how to earn the “bet”, what to ask for, visibility plan)
7) **Optional: coach selection scorecard** (criteria + interview questions + decision)
8) **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** (always)

## Workflow (8 steps)

### 1) Intake + goal clarity
- **Inputs:** user context; [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md).
- **Actions:** Confirm the primary goal (mentor, sponsor, or both). Define success in 3–6 months. Capture constraints and confidentiality boundaries.
- **Outputs:** 1-paragraph goal statement + assumptions/unknowns list.
- **Checks:** Goal is specific (not “grow my career”); constraints are explicit.

### 2) Convert needs into a “help map” (portfolio > single mentor)
- **Inputs:** skill gaps; target role/trajectory.
- **Actions:** Build a “mentor portfolio” map: which gaps need (a) advice, (b) feedback/coaching, (c) introductions, (d) advocacy. Decide where sponsorship is needed.
- **Outputs:** Mentor portfolio map + sponsor hypothesis (who could credibly advocate and why).
- **Checks:** Each need has a concrete ask and a target profile.

### 3) Build a target list + warm-path plan
- **Inputs:** network starting point; desired mentor/sponsor profiles.
- **Actions:** Generate 10–25 candidates across 3 pools: (1) inside the company, (2) adjacent network (2nd-degree), (3) external experts/peers. For each, identify a warm path (mutuals, communities, shared work) and a first-step.
- **Outputs:** Prioritized target list + warm-path map table.
- **Checks:** List is diversified; at least 50% have a plausible warm path; top 5 are high-fit and reachable.

### 4) Draft outreach that’s honest + specific (make it easy to say yes/no)
- **Inputs:** top candidates; ask types (mentor, sponsor, intro).
- **Actions:** Write 2–3 outreach variants that: (a) name the specific gap, (b) show humility (“I don’t know X yet”), (c) propose a small ask (15–30 min), (d) offer an easy decline.
- **Outputs:** Outreach pack (messages + subject lines + follow-up sequence).
- **Checks:** Messages are personalized; no guilt pressure; clear next action.

### 5) Run first conversations (agenda, questions, close)
- **Inputs:** scheduled chats; [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md) agendas.
- **Actions:** Prepare a 30-minute agenda, ask high-signal questions, and close with a clear next step (one concrete action + permission to follow up). Send a recap within 24 hours.
- **Outputs:** First-meeting pack + recap notes template.
- **Checks:** Each meeting ends with an explicit next step (or a respectful “no”).

### 6) Install the relationship operating system (cadence + value exchange)
- **Inputs:** initial meetings; user capacity.
- **Actions:** Define a sustainable cadence (monthly/quarterly). Set expectations: what you’ll bring (updates, artifacts, drafts), how you’ll respect time, and how you’ll give back (help, info, introductions).
- **Outputs:** Relationship OS + tracking table with next actions.
- **Checks:** Cadence is realistic; every relationship has a next touchpoint and a value exchange note.

### 7) Sponsor strategy (earn the bet, then make the ask)
- **Inputs:** sponsor candidates; current work context.
- **Actions:** Define “bet-worthy” outcomes you can deliver, then plan visibility: pre-wires, demos, written updates. Draft sponsor asks that are concrete: “introduce me to X”, “staff me on Y”, “say my name in Z room”, “back my promotion case”.
- **Outputs:** Sponsor strategy (earn → signal → ask) with scripts.
- **Checks:** Asks are specific and timely; you’re not asking for vague favoritism.

### 8) Quality gate + finalize
- **Inputs:** full draft pack.
- **Actions:** Run [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and score with [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md). Tighten weak sections. Add **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.
- **Outputs:** Final Mentor & Sponsor Plan Pack.
- **Checks:** The plan is actionable this week; scripts are copy/paste ready; risks are explicit.

## Quality gate (required)
- Use [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md).
- Always include: **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**.

## Examples

**Example 1 (typical):** “I’m a mid-level PM. I want a mentor for leadership growth and a sponsor to help me get staffed on higher-visibility work. Build a target list and write outreach messages. Ask me only 5 questions first.”  
Expected: A prioritized list (internal + external), warm paths, and 3 message templates.

**Example 2 (no strong network):** “I moved industries and don’t know many people. Help me find mentors outside my company and build a system to reach out without feeling spammy.”  
Expected: Targeting criteria + community sourcing plan + outreach and follow-up sequence + tracking.

**Boundary example:** “I want you to message 500 people on LinkedIn with the same pitch until someone replies.”  
Response: decline; offer a smaller, personalized approach with ethics/safety constraints and warm-path prioritization.
