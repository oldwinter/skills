## 4) Outreach messages (copy/paste)

### A) Mentor ask (direct but respectful)
Subject: Quick question on {topic}?

Hi {Name} — I’m {Your name}, {role} working on {context}. I’m learning {topic} and realizing I don’t yet know how to {specific gap}.

Would you be open to a 20-minute chat in the next 1–2 weeks? I’d love to ask a few specific questions about how you approached {similar problem}. Totally understand if now isn’t a good time.

Thanks,  
{Name}

### B) Warm intro request (to a mutual)
Subject: Intro to {Target} re: {topic}?

Hey {Mutual} — quick ask: would you be comfortable introducing me to {Target}? I’m working on {topic} and I’d love 15–20 minutes to learn how they’ve handled {specific problem}. If it’s easier, I can send a 2–3 sentence blurb you can forward.

No worries at all if it’s not a fit.

### C) Sponsor/advocate ask (after trust exists)
Subject: Quick ask re: {specific opportunity}

Hi {Name} — I’d love your advice on a specific next step. Over the last {time}, I’ve been focused on {outcome/results}. I’m aiming to take on {next scope/opportunity} because it aligns with {team/company priority}.

If you think it’s appropriate, would you be willing to {specific sponsor action: intro / staffing / vouch / “say my name”}? I can draft the blurb and handle logistics.

### D) Follow-up (no reply)
Hi {Name} — bumping this once in case it got buried. If now isn’t a good time, no worries at all. If helpful, I can also send my questions async and keep it lightweight.

## 5) First meeting agenda (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Learn {topic} and leave with 1–3 concrete next actions.

Agenda:
1) (2 min) Context: who I am + what I’m trying to do
2) (20 min) Questions:
   - What would you do in my situation over the next 4–8 weeks?
   - What’s the biggest mistake you see people make with {topic}?
   - If you were mentoring yourself at my level, what would you focus on?
3) (5 min) Reflection: here’s what I’m taking away
4) (3 min) Close:
   - Ask permission to follow up after I try the next steps
   - If relevant: “Is there someone else you’d suggest I talk to?”

## 6) Recap / thank-you note (send within 24 hours)

Subject: Thank you — recap + next steps

Hi {Name} — thank you again. Here’s what I’m taking away:
- {Insight 1}
- {Insight 2}
- {Action I will take next}

If you’re open to it, I’ll follow up in {4–6 weeks} with what happened and one question.

## 7) Relationship Operating System (cadence template)
