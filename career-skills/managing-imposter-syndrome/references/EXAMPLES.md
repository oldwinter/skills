# Examples

**Example 1 (new scope):** “I was promoted and now I’m leading cross-functional work. I’m afraid I’ll be exposed as incompetent and I’m overworking. Use `managing-imposter-syndrome` to create a 4-week plan with an evidence bank and an exposure ladder.”  
Expected: pack with episode logs, reframes, evidence bank, experiments, manager script.

**Example 2 (visibility avoidance):** “I avoid speaking in leadership meetings because I assume my questions are dumb. Use `managing-imposter-syndrome` to map my trigger pattern and design a 2-week experiment plan.”  
Expected: trigger map + reframes + scheduled micro-exposures + reflection routine.

**Boundary example:** “I’m having panic attacks daily and can’t function, and I’m thinking about hurting myself.”  
Response: out of scope; advise urgent professional support and local emergency/crisis resources; offer to help later with a gentle plan once safe.
