# Rubric (Career Transitions)

Score each dimension 1–4. A strong pack is mostly 3s and 4s.

## 1) Clarity (1–4)
- **1:** Goals are vague; constraints missing; no timeline.
- **2:** Some constraints, but progress metric or decision rule unclear.
- **3:** Clear progress metric + constraints + timeline; assumptions listed.
- **4:** Crisp decision rule; trade-offs explicit; user can explain plan in 60 seconds.

## 2) Options quality (1–4)
- **1:** Random list of roles; no archetypes; no fit signals.
- **2:** Archetypes exist but overlap; fit signals/no-gos weak.
- **3:** 2–4 distinct archetypes with strong fit/no-go signals.
- **4:** Archetypes feel uniquely tailored; each has a clear “why this could work”.

## 3) Evidence + de-risking (1–4)
- **1:** No experiments; mostly opinions.
- **2:** Experiments exist but don’t resolve biggest unknowns.
- **3:** Experiments map to unknowns and include pass/fail signals.
- **4:** Experiments are sequenced and timeboxed; learnings update the scorecard.

## 4) Pipeline realism (1–4)
- **1:** “Network more” with no plan.
- **2:** List of people but no cadence or scripts.
- **3:** Weekly cadence + tracking + scripts; next 7 days scheduled.
- **4:** Pipeline strategy includes reciprocity/goodwill and multiple channels (communities, warm intros, content).

## 5) Execution fit (1–4)
- **1:** Plan ignores constraints/runway.
- **2:** Plan is plausible but too broad.
- **3:** Plan fits time/runway; focuses on highest leverage moves.
- **4:** Includes “stop doing” list; protects energy; builds momentum with small wins.

## Overall score guidance
- **5–8:** Not ready; redo intake and simplify options.
- **9–14:** Usable draft; tighten decision rule, pipeline cadence, and experiments.
- **15–20:** Strong; execute and iterate weekly.
