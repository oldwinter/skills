# Intake (Writing Job Descriptions)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What role are we hiring and at what level?** (title, level, function)
2) **Why hire now?** What’s the business problem/opportunity and what “progress” must this hire create?
3) **What does success look like 12 months after start?** List 3–6 outcomes (with any measurable indicators).
4) **What should this person major in (1) and minor in (1–2)?** (the “spikes” you most need)
5) **What’s the real operating context?** (pace, ambiguity, constraints, team size, manager style, collaboration model)

## Helpful details (as needed)
- Role scope boundaries: what’s explicitly **out of scope**?
- Location/remote requirements, time zones, travel, on-call expectations (if any)
- Compensation range/band (if available and appropriate to share publicly)
- What can/can’t be said publicly? (stealth, sensitive roadmap, customer names)
- What’s currently wrong with your JD? (too generic, wrong candidates, low volume, misalignment, etc.)
- Do you want 1 draft or 2 variants (conservative/inclusive vs more polarizing)?

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A **draft scorecard** with 3–5 placeholder outcomes (explicitly labeled assumptions)
- A default spike structure: **1 major + 2 minors** (based on role title)
- Two JD variants:
  - **Variant A:** inclusive + broadly appealing (still outcome-based)
  - **Variant B:** more candid/polarizing about constraints and pace (only if appropriate)
