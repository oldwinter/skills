# Rubric (1–5)

Score the Job Description Pack. A strong pack is typically **≥ 22/30** with no category below 3.

## 1) Outcome clarity (1–5)
- **1:** No 12-month outcomes; mostly tasks and traits.
- **3:** Outcomes exist but are vague or not tied to business impact.
- **5:** Outcomes are specific, measurable where possible, and clearly tied to business impact + owned artifacts.

## 2) Spike definition (1–5)
- **1:** Laundry list of skills; no prioritization.
- **3:** Some prioritization but unclear what “strong” looks like.
- **5:** 1 major + 1–2 minors are crisp, evidence-backed, and directly linked to outcomes.

## 3) Signal & differentiation (1–5)
- **1:** Generic JD could apply anywhere.
- **3:** Some company context, but role still feels template-y.
- **5:** Clear “why here / why now”, concrete constraints, and specific challenges that attract the right candidates.

## 4) Honesty & filtering (1–5)
- **1:** Oversells or hides constraints; no filters.
- **3:** Some truth statements but weak self-selection.
- **5:** Candid, specific “what’s hard” + “who will thrive/won’t” that helps candidates self-select without bias.

## 5) Inclusivity & compliance hygiene (1–5)
- **1:** Includes biased language or ambiguous requirements; missing basic guardrails.
- **3:** Mostly clean but still has jargon/bias risk or unclear constraints.
- **5:** Clear, inclusive language; constraints stated truthfully; EEO/accommodations placeholder included; avoids protected-class proxies.

## 6) Iteration readiness (1–5)
- **1:** Treated as a one-and-done document.
- **3:** Mentions iteration but no triggers or tracking.
- **5:** Has iteration triggers, owners, and a version log tied to candidate signal.
