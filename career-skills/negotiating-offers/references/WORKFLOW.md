# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands the steps in `../SKILL.md` with practical heuristics, negotiation hygiene, and common failure modes.

## Step 1 — Intake + offer snapshot
Heuristics:
- Treat every negotiation as a **timeline** problem: deadlines, sequencing, and who decides what.
- Separate *what’s in the written offer* from *what’s implied verbally*.

Common failure modes:
- Negotiating without a deadline (drifts; missed leverage).
- Negotiating with the wrong person (e.g., asking hiring manager about base salary when recruiter owns comp bands).

## Step 2 — Goals, priorities, BATNA
Heuristics:
- Convert “I want more” into a ranked set of outcomes with trade-offs.
- Use a BATNA as a **calm decision rule**, not a threat.

Common failure modes:
- “Everything is a must-have” → no credible negotiation.
- Bluffs (“I’ll walk”) without willingness to walk.

## Step 3 — Success conditions (negotiate for the ability to succeed)
Heuristics:
- Many candidates only negotiate comp; senior candidates also negotiate **the job itself**.
- Frame asks as: “To deliver <outcomes>, I’ll need <resources/authority>. Is the org willing to commit?”
- If you identify big blockers (e.g., severe tech debt), ask what the company will do (budget/headcount/authority) rather than promising heroics.

Common failure modes:
- Turning success conditions into complaints instead of business outcomes.
- Not confirming commitments in writing (recap note; offer addendum; role charter).

## Step 4 — Offer components + tradeoffs
Heuristics:
- Most offers have more levers than people use: level/title, equity refresh, sign-on, start date, performance review timing, learning budget, mentorship, scope, relocation, remote exceptions.
- Use “features vs experiences” explicitly: if you’re taking less cash, get a clear growth/experience upside and make it concrete (mentorship cadence, scope, learning budget).

Common failure modes:
- Asking for everything at once (forces a hard “no”).
- Confusing preferences (“I want mentorship”) with negotiable commitments (“monthly skip-level + named mentor”).

## Step 5 — A/B/C package + strategy
Heuristics:
- Package asks to make “yes” easier (they can pick an option).
- Default sequencing: clarify success conditions → then negotiate comp; or run in parallel if timelines require it.

Common failure modes:
- A package with no floor (you can’t decide under pressure).
- A floor that is not actually acceptable (future resentment).

## Step 6 — Alternative structures (optional)
Heuristics:
- A contract/part-time proposal works best when you can define concrete outputs and reduce employer risk (trial period, easy exit, clear scope).
- Keep it specific: days/week, term, deliverables, review cadence.

Common failure modes:
- Vague “maybe contract?” ask with no scope or risk mitigation.
- Forgetting benefits/tax/healthcare implications (flag for professional advice).

## Step 7 — Scripts + rehearsal
Heuristics:
- Keep scripts polite, short, and specific. Silence is a tool; don’t fill it.
- Always send a recap email after calls: “Here’s what we agreed; here are open items.”

Common failure modes:
- Over-explaining or justifying personal needs instead of outcomes and market alignment.
- Mixing too many topics in one message.

## Step 8 — Quality gate + finalize
Heuristics:
- Your deliverables should be “sendable” (emails) and “speakable” (call agenda).
- Make risks explicit (offer rescinded risk, deadline risk, relationship risk) and mitigate.

Common failure modes:
- Leaving open questions unanswered (e.g., equity details, leveling, review cycle).
- No next steps scheduled (who will respond by when).
