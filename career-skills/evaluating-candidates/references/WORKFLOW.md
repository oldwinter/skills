# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with additional guidance and heuristics.

## Signal philosophy (practical defaults)

- **Reference checks are often the highest-signal** input when you get specific examples from long-term collaborators.
- **Work samples / paid trials** are the fastest way to see “agency under ambiguity”, especially in high-ownership roles.
- **Interviews** are useful but noisy; reduce noise with structured criteria and evidence capture.
- Avoid over-weighting: resume pedigree, polish, or a single standout story.

## Step 1 — Intake + decision framing
Lock the decision:
- What role/level and “success in 6 months” means
- Decision owner(s) + date
- Which signals are required vs optional
- Constraints (PII, internal-only, time, paid trial policy)

Heuristic: if you can’t name the decision and decision-maker, you’ll produce a “summary” that doesn’t change anything.

## Step 2 — Define the bar + criteria
Translate “we want someone great” into concrete criteria:
- Pick 4–8 criteria max (e.g., execution, judgment, collaboration, craft, leadership, customer empathy)
- Add **observable anchors** for strong/acceptable/weak
- Write explicit red flags (e.g., blaming others, persistent defensiveness, low agency)

Insight to preserve: defensiveness to feedback is a meaningful risk signal, especially for roles requiring fast iteration.

## Step 3 — Build the signal plan + evidence log
Assign responsibility to each signal:
- Interview: behavioral evidence + decision-making under constraints
- Work sample/trial: in-context execution, clarity, trade-offs, quality bar
- References: longitudinal performance, reliability, team dynamics, coachingability

Build a single **signal log** so you can compare candidates consistently.

## Step 4 — Work sample / take-home / paid trial
Design principles:
- Make it **job-relevant** and representative of real work
- Keep scope tight; state timebox and what “done” means
- Use a rubric with anchors to avoid “I liked it” scoring
- Prefer **paid** work if the task is substantial or resembles real work output
- Avoid collecting proprietary work; use sanitized scenarios

Strong work sample prompts:
- “Here’s an ambiguous goal; clarify requirements, propose a plan, and execute a slice.”
- “Here’s a messy system; identify the highest-impact improvements and make trade-offs.”

## Step 5 — Reference checks
How to increase signal:
- Target references who managed the candidate, shipped with them, or were close partners
- Ask for **specific examples**: what they did, trade-offs, outcomes, failure modes
- Ask calibration questions: “Compared to others at this level, where do they sit?”
- Ask staffing question: “In what role would you hire them again? What would you avoid?”
- Watch for consistent themes across references, not one-off anecdotes

Bias handling:
- Some references inflate; some understate. Look for evidence and calibration comparisons.
- Treat “too polished” references as lower-signal unless they include specifics.

## Step 6 — Synthesize → recommendation + mitigations
Avoid binary thinking too early.

Write a decision memo that includes:
- Strengths (with evidence)
- Concerns (with evidence)
- Unknowns (what you still don’t know)
- Recommendation (hire/no hire/hold) + confidence level
- Mitigations if hiring (onboarding plan, 30/60/90 goals, support)

## Step 7 — Quality gate + calibration
Before finalizing:
- Run [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) (process + fairness)
- Score with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md)
- Add **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**

If uncertain, propose the smallest additional signal:
- One targeted reference check to resolve a specific concern
- A narrow trial task focused on the gap
- A structured follow-up interview with 1–2 criteria only
