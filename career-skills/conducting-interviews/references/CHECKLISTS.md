# Checklists

Use these to validate the Interview Execution Pack (and your interview process) before finalizing.

## A) Stage clarity checklist
- [ ] Stage goal is explicit (screen vs deep-dive vs sell vs final decision)
- [ ] Duration and timeboxes are realistic and include candidate questions time
- [ ] What this stage does **not** cover is explicit (no overlap/confusion)

## B) Criteria + mapping checklist
- [ ] 4–8 criteria max; each criterion is defined in plain language
- [ ] Each criterion has “strong” and “weak” anchors
- [ ] Each interview question maps to exactly one primary criterion
- [ ] Scorecard requires evidence (not impressions) for every rating

## C) Question quality checklist
- [ ] Questions are primarily behavioral (“tell me about a time…”) not hypothetical debates
- [ ] Probes force specifics: role, constraints, trade-offs, results, what they’d do differently
- [ ] Includes “How did you prepare for this interview?” (when appropriate)
- [ ] Includes “Why do you want to work here?” (when appropriate)

## D) Substance-over-polish checklist
- [ ] There is an explicit plan to test substance when answers are polished (request specifics/counterfactuals)
- [ ] There is an explicit plan to help less-structured candidates understand the question (without leading)
- [ ] “Vibe” language is removed or translated into observable evidence

## E) Fairness + candidate experience checklist (non-legal)
- [ ] Notes separate facts from interpretations
- [ ] Interview avoids inappropriate topics and “gotcha” traps
- [ ] Candidate is told what to expect and what happens next
- [ ] Includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**
