# Checklists

Use these to validate the Community Building Pack before finalizing.

## A) Safety + trust checklist (required)
- [ ] No spammy tactics (auto-DMs, scraping, pay-for-posting, deceptive incentives)
- [ ] Code of conduct and enforcement ladder exist (warn → timeout → ban)
- [ ] Privacy norms are stated (recordings, screenshots, PII)
- [ ] Moderation capacity matches the chosen platform (open chat requires real coverage)

## B) Goal clarity checklist

## D) Platform fit checklist (go where they are)
- [ ] Home base is chosen for a 6–12 month commitment

## F) Programming + rituals checklist
- [ ] 4–8 week calendar exists with owners and goals
