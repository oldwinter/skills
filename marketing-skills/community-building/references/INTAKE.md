# Intake (Community Building)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**. If the user can’t answer, proceed with explicit assumptions and label them.

## A) Context + audience
1) What is the product and category (1–2 sentences)? Who is it for (ICP/roles/seniority)?
2) What stage are you at? (pre-launch / early / scaling / enterprise)
3) What is the primary business goal for community? (pick 1)  
   - Support deflection  
   - Activation/education  
   - Retention/engagement  
   - Advocacy/UGC/referrals  
   - Product feedback/co-creation  
   - Moving upmarket / enterprise credibility

## B) Members + “where they already are”
4) Who are the target members? (job titles, seniority, geography, language)
5) Where do they already gather today? (Slack groups, Discords, Reddit, LinkedIn/Twitter, meetups, forums, conferences)
6) What existing communities do you respect (even if you don’t own them)?

## C) Value exchange + movement
7) What does a member want most? (answers, belonging, status, career growth, peers, templates, opportunities)
8) What can members contribute? (questions, answers, builds, examples, templates, referrals, feedback)
9) What do you believe that the “status quo” gets wrong in your category? (seed for a movement/philosophy)

## D) Platform + operating constraints
10) Preferred platforms (or hard constraints): Discord, Slack, Circle, Discourse, GitHub, in-person, newsletter, etc.
11) Who owns the community day-to-day? How many hours/week? Any SMEs/moderators available?
12) Moderation/safety constraints: harassment risk, minors, sensitive topics, legal/compliance requirements.
13) Brand voice constraints: taboo words, tone, what you won’t do.

## E) Assets + distribution
14) What distribution do you already have? (email list size, social reach, customers, partners, events)
15) Any existing champions or power users? Who are they (roughly)?
16) Any planned launches or moments to anchor community activation? (conference, product launch, PR, new feature)

## F) Success + measurement
17) Timebox to show impact (e.g., 6 weeks, 90 days)?
18) What metrics can you measure today (even imperfectly)? (signups, activation, retention, referrals, support tickets, pipeline)
19) What would make you stop or pivot the community effort?
