# Rubric (Content Marketing Plan Pack)

Score each dimension 1–5. A “ship-ready” pack typically scores **≥ 24/30** with no dimension below 3.

## 1) ICP + content market fit clarity
1: ICP vague; anxieties/promises missing  
3: ICP defined; anxieties and promises present but generic  
5: ICP specific; anxieties mapped to repeatable promises and content types

## 2) Demand validation rigor (SEO)
1: Topics chosen without any demand signals  
3: Some demand signals; confidence labels inconsistent  
5: Clear evidence per SEO piece; “to validate” items have concrete next steps

## 3) Differentiation / information gain
1: Content could be written by anyone; no unique POV  
3: Some POV/examples; not consistently applied  
5: Every piece commits to unique insight, examples, and/or reusable artifacts

## 4) Channel focus + executability
1: Too many channels; unclear owners; calendar unrealistic  
3: Primary channel chosen; calendar mostly feasible  
5: Single primary channel for 4–8 weeks; clear owners/review workflow; calendar is runnable

## 5) AI safety + quality controls
1: “Use AI to write everything” with no checks  
3: Basic guidance; missing concrete human gates  
5: Clear allowed/disallowed uses; required human checks; claim/fact review built-in

## 6) Measurement + iteration loop
1: No metrics or decision rules  
3: Metrics listed; iteration cadence vague  
5: Metrics + leading indicators + weekly cadence + decision rules tied to actions
