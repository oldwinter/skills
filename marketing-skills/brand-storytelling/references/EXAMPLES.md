# Examples (good vs boundary)

These are example *prompts* and what a good Brand Storytelling Pack typically contains.

## Example 1 — Seed-stage founder story (good)
**Prompt:**  
“Use `brand-storytelling`. Company: we’re building a SOC2 automation tool. Audience: seed investors. Channels: pitch + podcast. Desired perception: credible, technical, direct, relentless. Raw material: I spent 18 months leading audits; the turning point was watching a team miss a launch because evidence was scattered. Proof: 3 design partners, 40% less audit prep time. Output: Brand Storytelling Pack.”

**What good looks like:**
- A five-second moment that’s specific and human
- A 2-minute script that lands “why now” and ties to proof
- A 30-second version that stands alone
- A Q&A bank that answers “why you?” and “why now?” crisply

## Example 2 — Consumer brand narrative (good)
**Prompt:**  
“We’re launching a fitness app for busy parents. Audience: customers. Channels: website + Instagram. Desired perception: warm, practical, non-judgmental. Raw material: founder story about burnout; the realization happened during a doctor visit. Output: Brand Storytelling Pack, plus a build-in-public plan.”

**What good looks like:**
- Identity hooks that are ethical (“for people who…”) and not manipulative
- A content pillar plan that is feasible (owners + cadence)
- Guardrails that prevent oversharing

## Boundary example — fabrication (not allowed)
**Prompt:** “Make the story more dramatic. Add a ‘near-death’ event. Invent metrics.”  
**Correct response:** Refuse fabrication; provide a structure with placeholders and an evidence-to-collect list.
