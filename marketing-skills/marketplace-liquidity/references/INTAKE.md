# Intake questionnaire (copy/paste)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**, then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## A) Marketplace basics (define the match)
1) What is the marketplace and who are the two sides (buyers vs sellers)?
2) What is the **core action** you want to be reliable (search → buy, request → booked, message → hire, etc.)?
3) Is matching **real-time** (minutes/hours) or **asynchronous** (days/weeks)? What is an acceptable time-to-match?
4) What quality constraints matter most (cancellations, no-shows, refunds, disputes, fraud, ratings)?

## B) Local markets + segmentation
5) What are your top 1–3 priority segments (geo, category, price band, cohort)?
6) What is the right “local market” unit (e.g., city × category × week; neighborhood × daypart)?
7) Where do you suspect fragmentation (long-tail categories, uneven geo distribution, time-of-day spikes)?

## C) Baseline data (best available)
8) What baseline metrics do you have today (even if rough): demand volume, supply availability, match/fill rate, time-to-match, acceptance, cancellations?
9) What are your main data sources (events, warehouse tables, dashboards)? Any known instrumentation gaps?
10) What is the current stage (pre-PMF / early PMF / growth / mature) and current growth constraints?

## D) Levers + constraints
11) What levers can you use: ranking/search, pricing, incentives/subsidies, onboarding, supply acquisition, demand acquisition, product changes, ops?
12) Constraints: budget, engineering capacity, policy/legal/privacy, brand/trust constraints, timebox.

## E) Decision + success definition
13) What decision will this work inform (what will you do differently after the diagnosis)?
14) What does “good liquidity” look like in one sentence for your priority segment?
15) What targets (or directional goals) matter most over the next 4–12 weeks?
