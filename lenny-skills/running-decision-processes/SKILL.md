Running Decision Processes  How you make decisions matters as much as what you decide. The best decision processes balance speed with quality, ensure the right people are involved, and create commitment even from those who disagreed. Without good decision processes, organizations slow down, politics flourish, and accountability disappears.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 65 experts.

1 Categorize decisions by importance and reversibility first  Not all decisions deserve the same process. High-stakes, irreversible decisions (one-way doors) need thorough analysis. Reversible, lower-stakes decisions (two-way doors) should move fast. Categorizing upfront prevents over-investing in minor decisions and under-investing in critical ones.

Featured guest perspectives

"The most important thing to figure out when you're dealing with any decision is actually figuring out how important that decision is... is the decision reversible or not."

— Brandon Chu    "The calories you spend on a decision should be proportional to the consequences of that decision... Jeff Bezos calls them one-way doors versus two-way doors."

— Dharmesh Shah        2 Designate a clear decision-maker upfront  Every decision needs one person accountable for making the final call. Use frameworks like RAPID or DACI to clarify who provides input, who must approve, and who decides. When accountability is diffuse, decisions either don't get made or get relitigated endlessly.

Featured guest perspectives

"Who is on the hook for this decision? Who cares if this decision is made? It's not six people with consensus. There's one person who owns this decision and that's the person we're going to empower."

— Ebi Atawodi    "We've put in things like RAPID, which is a really easy way to know who the decision-maker is... every decision has a single person named as the 'D'."

— Hari Srinivasan        3 Bias for action on reversible decisions  Speed is a competitive advantage. For reversible decisions, making a 70% confident choice quickly beats making a 90% confident choice slowly. You can iterate based on real-world feedback faster than you can analyze your way to certainty.

Featured guest perspectives

"If you want to improve the speed of a company, then make faster decisions... we don't just say, 'Let's circle back next week.' No, we'll have it done by next week."

— Brian Chesky    "Bias for action says speed matters in business and many decisions are reversible... being right is good, but being quick is necessary."

— Ethan Evans        4 Make intuition explicit so it can be tested  Gut feelings contain real data from accumulated experience—but they need to be articulated to be examined. Force yourself to write down the assumptions behind a gut feeling. This makes it possible to identify when intuition is right and when it's leading you astray.

Featured guest perspectives

"It's so incredibly necessary in improving decision quality to take what's implicit and make it explicit. Your intuition is sometimes right. If you don't make it explicit, you don't get to find out when it's wrong."

— Annie Duke    "I would think of your gut actually as a type of data... you need to be clear that that's what you're working with, but then it should be taken as seriously as any other data point."

— Maya Prohovnik        5 Create commitment through 'disagree and commit'  After debate, the team must unite behind the decision—even those who disagreed. This requires a clear decision point and explicit commitment. Lingering dissent undermines execution. The mantra is 'debate, decide, unite'—once decided, everyone champions the path forward.

Featured guest perspectives

"Ours is debate, decide, unite... once you make a decision, getting alignment around that decision is extremely important."

— Dharmesh Shah    "The word alignment is stupid because it doesn't exist... shift the goal from 'agreement' to 'conveying information.' Use the 'Nevertheless' framework: acknowledge the input, then state the decision path."

— Annie Duke        6 Document decisions for learning and accountability  Keep a record of important decisions: the context, the options considered, and the rationale for the choice. This enables learning by comparing predictions to outcomes, provides accountability, and prevents relitigating decisions when memories fade.

Featured guest perspectives

"PMs need as many reps as possible in making decisions, documenting the rationale behind those decisions, and then crucially seeing the outcome of them."

— Kevin Yien    "We basically write a six-pager that looks at all the different aspects... and everyone reads that page for about 15 minutes and then question, answers, comments."

— Tanguy Crusson

✗ Common Mistakes

Applying the same rigorous process to every decision regardless of stakes and reversibilityPursuing consensus instead of designating a clear decision-makerMoving slow on reversible decisions waiting for certainty that will never comeAllowing decisions to be relitigated after they're made     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Decisions get made quickly without endless meetingsTeam members know who is responsible for which types of decisionsPeople commit to decisions even when they initially disagreedYou learn from past decisions by reviewing predictions against outcomes

"A curiosity loop is essentially going to a whole bunch of people. In this case, I sent out an email very quickly to about 10 or 11 people and asking them, 'Hey, here are nine topics for Lenny's Podcast. What are two or three of the topics that resonate with you and why?'"  Tactical:  Ask specific questions that solicit rationale rather than biased 'yes/no' answers.Curate a mix of subject matter experts and people who know you personally.Make the ask lightweight (e.g., 'pick top 2 of 9') to ensure a high response rate from busy people.Close the loop by processing the info and thanking participants for their impact on your decision.    "I looked at those values and I said, 'Well, if I draw a straight line from where I am right now and just extend it forward and play the rest of the movie as it plays out, given the current plot line, how well does that optimize for those values?'"  Tactical:  Filter a broad list of value words down to a top 3-5 list.Apply these values to specific opportunities to see if they pass or fail your internal criteria.Prioritize the 'inner scorecard' (personal fulfillment) over the 'outer scorecard' (status, wealth, titles).

"How do we decide when we disagree? And that is a very good thing to explore because there's actually a lot of different ways to decide when you disagree... let's assume that the person who cares the most can win that argument. It might be, the person who's got the best perspective and the most expertise can win that argument."  Tactical:  Decide if the 'most passionate' person wins or the 'most expert' person winsConsider a 'back and forth' system where partners take turns making the final call

Ami Vora 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"As you get senior, the only problems you'll see are ones that are fundamentally unsolvable because otherwise, someone would've solved it before they got to you. And so all you're doing is choosing which branch of suboptimal you're going to put your name on and describing the principles you're using."  Tactical:  Acknowledge when a decision is suboptimal but necessary.Clearly communicate the principles and context used to arrive at a difficult choice.

"It's so incredibly necessary in improving decision quality to take what's implicit and make it explicit. It's not that intuition is crap, your intuition is sometimes right. If you don't make it explicit, then you don't get to find out when it's wrong."  Tactical:  Document the implicit assumptions behind a 'gut' feeling.Review these explicit assumptions later to see where your intuition was right or wrong.    "There is no such thing as a long feedback loop. And the way you choose to shorten the feedback loop is to say, what are the things that are correlated with the outcome that I eventually desire?"  Tactical:  Identify 'necessary but not sufficient' milestones (e.g., funding at Series A as a proxy for a 10-year exit).Track these intermediate signals to evaluate decision quality in real-time.    "The word alignment is stupid... because it doesn't exist. You have 10 people in a room and they're all really different people with different opinions, and they're never going to come out of the room agreeing with each other. And it's really bad if the expectation is that they're supposed to... the meeting becomes coercive."  Tactical:  Shift the goal from 'agreement' to 'conveying information.'Use the 'Nevertheless' framework: acknowledge the input, then state the decision path.

"I try to construct this past knowledge of what had happened and what were the decisions that were made and why were those decisions made, whether they were good or bad it didn't matter, so that I could better understand how to make decisions going forward and to learn from the mistakes that I didn't personally live through."  Tactical:  Research past failed products or projects to understand the context of previous decisions.Ask long-tenured employees about the history of specific initiatives to understand current resistance.    "It's not about making the right decision, it's about making the decision. ... as long as your decision is like 70% right, you can iterate on that 20, 30% in either direction, but if you don't commit, then you don't actually get any new information that is high fidelity and high quality."  Tactical:  Commit to a decision once you have roughly 70% of the necessary information.Reward the 'learning' from a decision rather than just the outcome to encourage risk-taking.

Austin Hay 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"This concept of thinking gray is so often in life and in our jobs, we are forced to make decisions very quickly. We have to think black or white about a problem set or a solution, and then decide. One of his tactics is this concept of thinking gray, which is actually to not decide for as long as you possibly can before you have to decide."  Tactical:  Resist the urge to make immediate binary decisions when faced with pressure from stakeholders.Use the extra time to see if the problem evolves or if better solutions emerge.

Archie Abrams 1 quote

"Every single project that goes out has a few minute video with Figmas and everything, and everything that shipped. Needs to be okay-toed, so approved by the group lead. There's nothing that can ship without that okay-to approval. And that okay-to approval has to be Glen, Carl, myself with different groups."  Tactical:  Require a short video demo and design walkthrough for every project before it can be released.Designate specific 'taste-makers' or group leads who must personally approve all shipments to maintain a high quality bar.

Ben Horowitz 4 quotes

"The worst thing that you do as a leader is you hesitate on the next decision. The thing that causes you to hesitate is both decisions are horrible."  Tactical:  Avoid the trap of avoiding a subject because both outcomes are badRecognize that failing to make an explicit decision causes organizational anxiety    "The psychological muscle you have to build to be a great leader is to be able to click in the abyss and go, 'Okay, that way's slightly better. We're going to go that way. If everybody agrees with the decision, then you didn't add any value because they would've done that without you.' So the only value you ever add is when you make a decision that most people don't like."  Tactical:  Build the psychological strength to choose the 'slightly better' path even in dire situationsMeasure your value by the decisions you make that lack consensus    "really, it's like all plane crashes are a series of bad decisions. And none of the decisions by themselves is that bad, but when you add them up, it's bad... if you can break psychologically, you can take the sunk cost, then that gets you out of a lot of bad paths."  Tactical:  Identify and break the chain of small bad decisions before they accumulateWillingly accept sunk costs to exit a failing path    "What happens to as CEO, it's like, 'Okay, if we rearchitect, this product, the architecture is not actually get us to where we need to go. I kind of know that. But if we rearchitect it, we're going to probably miss all the features, miss the quarter, have trouble raising money, shudder, et cetera. So that's really bad. And then not rearchitecting is really bad, and so I'm just going to try to and avoid this subject because I don't even want to deal with either of those.' And that's the worst thing, because if action is the better choice and that's good."  Tactical:  Run towards the 'pain in the darkness' rather than avoiding difficult trade-offsTrust your eyes and act on what you see rather than waiting for a perfect option

Bill Carr 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"The data rarely makes the decision for you. What is happening is then a lot of judgment and interpretation of the data, weighing that, weighing various factors to then come to a decision. That is sort of the right a lot part. The right a lot part comes from having what we call sort of sound judgment, which generally come... Some people maybe are born with this, not a lot of them, mostly they get it through experience."  Tactical:  Develop sound judgment by observing others and learning from past mistakesAcknowledge that data informs but rarely dictates the final decision

Brandon Chu 2 quotes

"know how to make really, really hard high conviction decisions that actually can't be solved. You got to take a leap of faith and how to do that and bring teams through that type of ambiguity and then how to lead by example and have accountability when you make those choices."  Tactical:  Take leaps of faith when data cannot solve the problemMaintain high accountability for the choices made    "the first thing it argues is that the most important thing to figure out when you're dealing with any decision is actually figuring out how important that decision is. Since we're faced with hundreds of decisions in any given moment around the product or whatever, and that we're only human and we can only prioritize a few, you got to figure out the importance of them so you can prioritize. And so it talks about things like either decision reversible or not."  Tactical:  Evaluate if a decision is reversible or one-way before committing deep analysisSpend the vast majority of your time on the 1% of decisions that are truly criticalDelegate or use gut instinct for low-importance, reversible decisions to maintain team velocity

Brian Chesky 1 quote

"If you want to improve the speed of a company, then make faster decisions. And fast decisions come from a bias of action. If we're in a meeting, we don't just say, 'Okay, let's circle back on this next week.' No, we'll have it done by next week. Let's stay in this meeting until it's done."  Tactical:  Avoid 'circling back' by making decisions in the roomSet a high tempo for follow-ups (e.g., check-ins within hours or the next morning)

"If you're not sure who the decision maker is, one, it's probably you. And I'd rather you act that way than not because you're going to like slow the whole company down. Follow a process and get it done, and don't forget to actually make a decision."  Tactical:  Assume you are the decision maker if it's unclear to avoid slowing down the companyAsk explicitly who the decision maker is if you are worried it is not you    "In the book, I talk about this framework that Bezos uses, type one, type two decisions. Is it high impact? Is it irreversible? Is it not? Really evaluate, what kind of decision is this? How hard is it? And then follow a process and get it done."  Tactical:  Evaluate if a decision is Type 1 (high impact, irreversible) or Type 2 (reversible)Use frameworks like SPADE to make the decision criteria and owner explicit

Dharmesh Shah 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"the calories you spend on a decision should be proportional to the consequences of that decision... He calls them one-way doors versus two-way doors... I'm taking it one level further, which is, it literally should be proportional."  Tactical:  Identify the factors/variables that should impact a decision before choosing an option.Stack-rank the importance of those factors to guide the final choice.    "ours is debate, decide, unite. That's our kind of phrase that we use in HubSpot culture... once you make a decision, getting alignment around that decision... is extremely important"  Tactical:  Designate a single person to make the final decision (DRI).Use the 'Unite' phase to ensure the team moves forward without lingering dissent.

"Is it a trapdoor decision? Which I think is an Amazon concept. One-way door, or two-way door... Stripe was actually really good at being rigorous... about what actually was a trapdoor decision."  Tactical:  Categorize decisions as 'trapdoor' or 'reversible' before debating themMove faster on reversible decisions like pricing by grandfathering existing users

"It is the responsibility of the CEO to make brave and hard decisions unilaterally, yes, using their experts as inputs and be responsible for the outcome. If I make decisions that propel the company in the way that thankfully my decisions have, I get rewards and kudos... If I don't, I get fired."  Tactical:  Use experts for input but avoid 'decision by committee.'Take full personal responsibility for the results of unilateral decisions.

"Bias for action says speed matters in business and many decisions are reversible. And so it's important to go faster. And I think people don't understand that in a competitive environment, being right is good, but being quick is necessary."

"As long as it's possible for wherever it's like a two-way door, you can do whatever you want... If it's A one-way door, it's worth thinking about and sort of doing correctly."  Tactical:  Move fast on two-way door decisions that are easily reversible.Slow down and apply more thought to one-way door decisions that impact long-term architecture.

"Is this a high stakes decision or a low stakes decision? ... magnitude ... and then, is it reversible? Amazon calls those, this was a two-way door decision. It's reversible.

So it's like R-I-D-E."  Tactical:  Identify the Requester (R) who initiates the changeIdentify those who provide Input (I) to the processClearly designate the Decider (D) who has final authorityAssign the Executor (E) responsible for the rollout

"Small startups agree on how they decide together. So after that, everyone just follow the process. That's usually how things work out... I think you just have to have a process so you don't rehash every decision after you made them a million times."  Tactical:  Define clear areas of expertise where individual founders have final sayCommit to a decision once the process is complete to maintain velocity

Hari Srinivasan 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We've put in things like we have something called RAPID, which is a really easy way to know who the decision-maker is... The R is for who's recommending it. The A, who has to agree. The I is for other people who may be able to be putting in an input. It's basically a list of people who need to be in the decision chain."  Tactical:  Ensure every decision has a single person named as the 'D' (Decision-maker)Implement a five-day escalation rule to resolve misalignments quicklyIf you have three back-and-forth emails, pick up the phone to reach a decision

Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We're using this tactic that we call work alone together. And specifically the note and vote is this method where everyone's in silence... writing down their own answers to this question... then the team's going to vote on those. And then one person who's designated as the decider... is going to say, 'Okay, this is our decision for now.'"  Tactical:  Use 'Note and Vote': individuals write ideas in silence, then the team votes.Designate a 'Decider' (usually the CEO or CPO) to make the final call after seeing the team's input.

Jason Fried 1 quote

"I don't know how to make decisions by numbers or I don't find any joy in it, frankly. I've always been intuition driven and gut driven. And frankly, to be honest, I think everyone actually is... I think everything's a judgment call."  Tactical:  Value 'judgment and experience' as the primary criteria for executive decision-makingUse data as one input among many, rather than the sole deciderAsk 'How does this feel?' to tap into the team's collective intuition

Jerry Colonna 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Why is it that nobody on my team can make a decision without me? ... How does it make you feel when they make a decision that you disagree with? She said, 'I'm furious.' ... That's your growth edge. How can I be with the people in my life making boneheaded decisions about something that I care so much about?"  Tactical:  Examine your emotional reaction to team members making 'wrong' decisions.Shift from controlling decisions to managing the relationship and the 'growth edge' of allowing others to lead.

"We're in the middle of a meeting, we need to make a decision. Let's either make the decision or if we can't, let's Slack call in the person that we need in order to make that decision. And we'll be done with the decision today."  Tactical:  Pull necessary stakeholders into current meetings via Slack or calls to resolve blockers immediatelyValue the tempo of decision-making as a core cultural differentiator    "I am anti-process as a substitution for deep product thinking... I like to have just enough process to create a frame so that the right decisions can happen and no more."  Tactical:  Avoid dogmatically applying frameworks like Scrum or Kanban if they don't fit the team's contextUse process only to create a frame for decision-making

Jessica Hische 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I feel like my strength with the work that I do in general is just being incredibly decisive and understanding that there's 10 good answers to every one question... I feel like I can look at 10 gray sofas and go, it feels like there's two or three categories of sofa here, and then within those categories, there's a couple of good options. Here's a brand that I recognize is known for being of high quality. That one's good enough. I can get to it really quickly."  Tactical:  Categorize options into 2-3 buckets to simplify complex decision-making.Accept 'good enough' quickly to maintain momentum rather than over-analyzing every possible variation.    "Nothing is ever 100% perfect, and the most you can aspire and get to is 99.8 or whatever. That last 0.2%, you could spend your whole life trying to do that, or you could move on and do other things and understand that it's nearly perfect."  Tactical:  Identify the point of diminishing returns in creative or technical work.Prioritize moving on to new projects over the exhaustive pursuit of absolute perfection.

Joe Hudson 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"What it tells us, and this is not exact, I'm paraphrasing for a podcast, but we make decisions in the emotional center of our brain. We use logic to try to figure out how we're going to feel. ... There's no such thing as a logical decision. That idea is like, I'm just going to be logical and just make a logical decision, it doesn't. Neurologically, it's just untrue."  Tactical:  Acknowledge the emotional drivers behind a decision rather than pretending it is purely logical.Increase your 'emotional fluidity' to access a wider range of solution sets that are otherwise blocked by emotional resistance.    "The other one that I find really, really useful and very hard to execute on until you really understand it is creating a set of principles to live by. ... if you really take a look at what it is you're making your decisions on and then really think about, well, what would be the five or six things that if I made decisions with these principles, I'm guaranteed success?"  Tactical:  Define a set of no more than five simple principles (e.g., 'Embrace intensity' or 'Connection first').Test each principle for five days to see if it produces the desired life or business outcomes.Define what each principle is NOT to provide clearer boundaries for action.

"The better teams make high, better decisions faster... Company A buys into the whole idea of an extremely rigorous decision-making process. It's very process driven... Company B, maybe they're just all about this kind of mushy, diverse perspectives thing... Company C... very top down CEO driven."  Tactical:  Identify if your company's decision-making style is process-driven, collaborative, or visionary-led, and align your team's workflow to match it.    "There's things like that out there. There's this thing Cynefin, which is a way to understand the systems and decision-making problems have, are you dealing with a clear system, a complicated system, a complex system, or a chaotic system?"  Tactical:  Use the Cynefin framework to categorize a problem before choosing a decision-making approach.

"The best decision-making is emotional... if you are on the other hand able to just welcome and be with whatever emotions would arise on the other side of a decision, you're able to decide clearly instead of being skewed one way or the other."

"The wisdom of the crowd works when the people involved with the decision are bringing diverse sources of information and judgment to the table... If you want to check your gut, get a bunch of different guts together, get a bunch of different people in the room who can bring evidence and intuition to bear."  Tactical:  Engage 'System 2' (slow, analytical thinking) to check gut reactions.Facilitate decision meetings that include diverse perspectives and evidence types.

"I think often the dangers of people saying, 'Oh, I don't have data to back this up. It's just what I think. And I'm not sure people are going to agree with me, so I'm just not going to say it.' So we don't have the data of all those gut opinions of these subject matter experts in the room, even though that gut information to me is just as important as anything we could get from the SQL database."  Tactical:  Encourage team members to share gut opinions even without supporting metricsTreat subjective opinions as valuable data points in the decision-making loop

Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter 1 quote      "One key attribute is there's one clear driver of the project, who's effectively a founder... and also there's one clear decision-maker that they go to... I think that's a big reason we're able to make decisions effectively, quickly, in a simple way."  Tactical:  Assign a single 'driver' (founder-equivalent) to the projectEstablish a 'Thermal' structure where the team is 100% focused and uses its own decision-making process

"One relatively minor thing that I thought had a lot of impact with execution is being very clear that whoever is accountable for the results should also be the decider. I found that a lot of literature out there says that product teams should be this communal best ideas come from everywhere group... but I think not having it be super clear who is accountable and who is deciding often slows down execution a lot."  Tactical:  Ensure the person accountable for the results is the final decider for the projectAvoid overly communal decision-making processes that obscure accountability and slow down progress

"PMs need as many reps as possible in making decisions, documenting the rationale behind those decisions, and then crucially seeing the outcome of them... Look around you. There's other teams that are making decisions. What would you do if you were in that position with the information you have? Great, write it down."  Tactical:  Keep a decision log where you document the rationale for your choices.Simulate decisions for other teams or companies to get 'free' reps.Set calendar reminders to review the outcomes of your documented decisions months later.

Lane Shackleton 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Dharmesh Shah has this ritual from HubSpot called flash tags... It ranges from ... I think it's FYI, suggestion, recommendation, plea. FYI is basically like I had a thought, take it or leave it kind of thing. Suggestion is ... is this a hill I'm going to die on? And FYI is there's no hill in sight. Suggestion is there's a hill. I'm not going to die on it but this is what I would do if I were you. Recommendation is I'm climbing the hill. I'm not going to die here, but I've thought about this a lot, so don't ignore this. And then the fourth one, plea, is hopefully rarely used in the organization. It's like, I don't like dying on hills. That's not what we do here. But this is a pretty good candidate for it. You should really trust me."  Tactical:  Label feedback as FYI, Suggestion, Recommendation, or Plea.Use these tags in shared documents or verbal meetings to clarify if a leader is mandating a change or just offering a thought.    "A very simple thing that he did probably in the last six months was he had a table of all the upcoming decisions and then at a tag-up ... he had all the upcoming decisions and then he let people hit a little reaction and say, "Oh, I don't need to be involved. Just notify me of the decision after." Or, "Hey, I have some opinions, but you can keep going." Or, "No, I really want to be heavily involved in this decision.""  Tactical:  Create a table of upcoming decisions and let stakeholders opt-in to their level of involvement.Use 'notify me after' as a default for low-impact decisions to increase velocity.

Listen to episode →

"I will definitely think that I would be described as someone who's going more by their gut when looking at date end results... I'm very comfortable and very common in using qualitative responses and things like that and supplement to quantitative data to make a decision."  Tactical:  Set the decision game plan and risk tolerance before running an experimentUse qualitative feedback to corroborate quantitative trends when confidence intervals are lowEducate stakeholders on why a high volume of experiments is safer than a few high-confidence tests

Matt Mullenweg 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"If we had voted for whether we should do that or not, everyone would've voted against it or the majority would have. It was really a few core people of us in the community... that said, 'Hey, this is the future and it's going to take 10 years to do and it's going to be a long bet.'"  Tactical:  Identify 'long bets' that may be unpopular in the short term but are necessary for future relevanceBe prepared to endure years of negative feedback during major product transitions

Maya Prohovnik 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I think where people get into trouble is when they think that they can rely solely on the data... I would think of your gut actually as a type of data and I think it's a totally valid one and it's just I think you need to be clear that that's what you're working with, but then it should be taken as seriously as any other data point."  Tactical:  Treat 'gut feeling' as accumulated experience-based dataObjectively explain the reasoning behind a gut feeling to influence othersUse data to form and test hypotheses rather than as a sole decision-maker

"A DACI is a framework to think about the different roles on the team on a project or an area. So D stands for Driver... A is Accountable... C is Contributor... And I is informed. And so it's a nice simple framework for when you are working across teams and it needs to be clear who is in what role."  Tactical:  Assign one 'Driver' to push the project forwardIdentify one 'Accountable' person as the final decision-makerExplicitly list 'Contributors' and those who only need to be 'Informed'

Mihika Kapoor 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I think that putting out an idea, even if it's totally wrong, is a much better catalyst for getting to a good solution because people are much more likely to react to an idea than to nothing."  Tactical:  Use the 'one-way doors vs. two-way doors' framework to maintain decision speedEnter research with an 'A-' idea to refine it rather than starting at zeroAdopt a 'strong opinions, weakly held' mindset to remain agile when external signals change

Nabeel S. Qureshi 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"When you started a new project, you basically had to organize what they called a murder board for it... the idea is, basically, you write up a two-page plan for the project. You invite three or four smart folks who don't know anything about the project and their job is just to tear apart your plan."  Tactical:  Write a concise two-page plan covering vision, goals, tactics, and principles.Invite 'outsiders' to the project specifically to tear the plan apart.Include principles that are specific enough to be disagreed with (avoid platitudes like 'move fast').

Noah Weiss 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Your job as to facilitate the pace and quality of decision making. That is very different than you are the person who makes all the decisions. In fact, I think one of the things that PM struggled with early on is how do you actually get the team to be able to make high quality decisions quickly without you arbitrarily playing tiebreaker all the time."  Tactical:  Focus on the *pace* and *quality* of the team's decisions rather than making them yourself.Avoid acting like a 'mini-CEO' or dictator; act as a facilitator.

Nilan Peiris 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"You can't split test your way to love. ... This thing of building conviction on what matters, and I watch how teams slowly build this and you need the data there to make sure it doesn't become a hubris, right? That enables you to make much bigger changes than just experimenting away, and it forces you to get clear on what actually is the problem to solve here, and how do I solve it really, really well?"  Tactical:  Use data to build long-term conviction rather than just validating small, isolated changesEncourage PMs to develop a 'gut feel' by talking to customers before deciding what to buildPrioritize solving core problems 'really, really well' over running high volumes of low-conviction experiments

Patrick Campbell 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I found the model that people who aren't great at first principal thinking... is this thing called problem, cause, solution. So I learned this in debate in college and high school, and it basically is you have a problem that you're trying to solve. Well, you can't actually solve a problem... you want to break down what are all the causes."  Tactical:  Use the 'Problem, Cause, Solution' framework to move from symptoms to root issuesRank causes by magnitude to ensure you are solving the most impactful part of the problemApply this framework to everything from high-level strategy to individual support tickets

"Tim Ferriss' fear setting, and he basically forces you to write down what are your fears, how could you mitigate these. But more powerfully, the second part is... And you're framing them around action. And so he reframes, what is the cost of inaction?"  Tactical:  Write down specific fears and mitigation strategiesExplicitly calculate the 'cost of inaction' over 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years

Rahul Vohra 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"The idea here is that for important decisions, you should be able to identify one, one reason that on its own supports the decision. It's based on the observation that all too often we rely on a collection of weak reasons to justify decisions."  Tactical:  Ask: 'If only one of these reasons was true, would we still make this decision?'Avoid 'pro/con' lists where a high volume of weak points outweighs a single critical factor.

Tactical:  Identify the single most painful gap between current results and aspirations.Apply the strategy cascade specifically to solve that one gap rather than trying to solve everything at once.Iterate by continuously identifying and closing the next most significant gap.

Shreyas Doshi 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I guess what I'm saying, Lenny, is one of my other tactical tips would be sometimes it is useful to pause for two minutes, or two days, or two weeks before making that decision, right? Because frankly, most doors that look like two-way doors are actually one-way doors. They are two-way doors at Bezos' level, but as a PM leader, for you, they are a one-way door, and that's making you busy."  Tactical:  Pause before making decisions to think through customer motivation, differentiation, and distribution.Be wary of using 'two-way door' logic as an excuse for shallow thinking.Evaluate ideas separate from social proof, authority bias, or catchy metaphors.

Shishir Mehrotra 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Dory/Pulse... Everybody writes down what they think and we hide everybody else's until you're done writing. So you force yourself to be eloquent about your opinion, on the record about it, and unbiased. And then the second thing we do is called Dory, which is instead of randomly asking questions, we ask people to put the questions on the table and then we take a round of up quoting and down voting them"  Tactical:  Use 'Pulse' to have everyone write their opinions simultaneously and hidden to avoid groupthink.Use 'Dory' to crowdsource and rank questions for meetings to ensure the most important topics are addressed.    "Coinbase has a ritual... they have this subtle nudge thing... the person running the meeting pre-fills that with what they want from that person. You are an approver... I need you to tell me do we have the budget or not? Or I need you to tell me am I authorized to make this change"  Tactical:  Pre-fill decision documents with specific roles for each stakeholder.Explicitly state what specific answer or authorization is needed from each 'approver'.

Shaun Clowes 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We get paid in product management to make decisions, good decisions, paid to make good decisions that will deliver business benefit. And a decision with too little data is fatal. A decision that takes too long and collects too much data is also fatal."  Tactical:  Evaluate your performance based on the quality and speed of your decisions rather than just the volume of your activity.

Tanguy Crusson 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Point A... had four stages called Wonder, Explore, Make and Impact... we basically write a six pager that looks at all the different aspects of all the questions that we're going to answer. And then we are in a meeting with the Point A stakeholders and the founders of Atlassian. And everyone reads that page for about 15 minutes and then question, answers, comments."  Tactical:  Implement a staged gate process for internal incubationUse 15 minutes of silent reading at the start of decision meetings to ensure everyone is informed

Tim Holley 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Nick, our CPO like to say you don't have to have the best ideas, but you have to choose the best ideas. And so really figuring out how you're selecting what you're going to build and then living with the consequences... when we need to move forward, it is the PM that is on the hook for those things."  Tactical:  Clarify who is ultimately accountable for the decision when consensus is unclear.Focus on selecting the best ideas from the team rather than generating them all yourself.

Tomer Cohen 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We might be wrong but we're not confused. It's a simple phrase, but it has in my opinion, so much depth into that and ultimately something I really believe in. It's rooted in clarity and principles that ultimately lead to leadership."  Tactical:  Distinguish between 'clarity of thought' (problem definition) and 'clarity of execution' (resourcing).Avoid hedging; once a path is decided, ensure the entire team pulls in that direction to give the project a chance at success.

Varun Mohan 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I wish I had... this idea of just being okay with being wrong faster. I always think about things on when we make decisions... I wish we had made the decision to do this a couple months earlier... re-evaluate your hypotheses and get into an uncomfortable space way more frequently."  Tactical:  Set regular intervals to challenge and potentially kill existing company beliefsOptimize for the speed of the 'pivot' once new information contradicts initial assumptions

Ebi Atawodi 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I'm in too many conversations where I'm like, 'Who is on the hook for this decision? Who cares if this decision is made?' It's not like six people with consensus. Who is the person? And I'm very big on people on count... There's one person who owns this decision and that's the person that we're going to empower to get all the context, get all the input, to make the decision."  Tactical:  Identify a single 'informed captain' for every major decisionEmpower the decider to gather input but ultimately make the final call independently

Keith Yandell 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"There needs to be someone that says, 'All right. We got to be clear on who the decision maker is here. If we haven't reached a consensus, who's the tiebreaker?'"  Tactical:  Explicitly name the tie-breaker (CEO, GM, or Head of Product) before the debate beginsSet a strict time horizon for when the final decision must be made

"Usually a meeting can be and hopefully a meeting is really either is a decision meeting. So if there is a decision, I need three options and I need a recommendation that should hopefully help focus the meeting."  Tactical:  Always present three options and one recommendation for any major decision

Nickey Skarstad 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I love the concept of one way versus two way door decision making... If your team is making a really critical long-term decision that's going to be limiting to a lot of the future things that you could want or need to do, that is a one way door decision. And you should spend time really thinking about discussing it... If it is a two-way door decision, it's not going to make a huge impact, you can change it later if you need to, let your team cruise on those things."  Tactical:  Identify 'one-way door' decisions (e.g., marketplace standards) and slow down for deep reviewEmpower teams to 'cruise' on 'two-way door' decisions to maintain autonomy    "If you can get teams to align on first principles early on, it saves you a lot of heartache later because you've got people to align way early days before you even got into the design process, or before you had to start thinking about how do we actually technically implement this."  Tactical:  Write out first principles for every major feature or strategyGet alignment on these principles before starting design or technical implementation

Paige Costello 1 quote

Tactical:  Limit the number of formal reviewers to no more than three per piece of work.Ensure only one person is designated as the final 'blocker' or approver.

Sanchan Saxena 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"The idea that we have... is the idea of a directly responsible individual or DRI. For every project, we'll establish a DRI... DRI's job is to take all that input and make a decision. Not take all that input and do necessarily what's right by everybody, right? Still do what's right by the customer."  Tactical:  Assign a single DRI for every project to avoid convoluted decision-makingUse a written 'RAPID' format for cross-functional input to ensure clarityPractice 'disagree and champion'—once a decision is made, everyone must evangelize it

Tobi Lutke 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"You make you re-derive literally every decision that is valuable, every foundational assumption, every foundational ABC direction. And you want to see the observation you've made in the meantime since you last derived the next step. Re-running the entire function over the state that is now updated, the higher fidelity information, would you come to the very same thing?"  Tactical:  Re-run the decision function periodically to see if foundational assumptions still holdIdentify the specific 'Boolean' or input that has changed to justify a pivotAvoid the sunk cost fallacy by being willing to land in a completely different 'landing zone' after re-evaluating facts

Will Larson 1 quote

"Will anyone remember what we decided in six months? Because I think people stress out about a lot of decisions, but I increasingly believe most decisions people stress out about just aren't that important."  Tactical:  Ask 'Will anyone care in six months what we did here?' to decide how much time to invest in a decision
