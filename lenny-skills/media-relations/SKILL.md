Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 2 experts.

1 Prep thoroughly before any outreach  Before pitching, do extensive research on the reporters you're targeting. Understand what they cover, what stories they've written recently, and what angles might interest them. This prep work is the foundation of effective pitching - reporters can immediately tell when someone hasn't done their homework.

"Step one is prep... Step two is figuring out who to pitch... Step three is the actual pitch."

— Jason Feifer        2 Offer strategic exclusives  Exclusives are one of your most powerful tools in media relations. Offering a reporter the exclusive on a story gives them an incentive to cover you and builds relationship equity. Stagger your outreach so you can offer exclusives to your top targets before going broader.

Featured guest perspectives

— Emilie Gerber        3 Build ongoing relationships, not transactional pitches  The best media relations is relationship-based, not transaction-based. Help reporters even when you don't have news. Become a trusted source they can call for industry perspective. These relationships pay dividends over years, not just for your next launch.
