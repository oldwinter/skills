Sales Qualification  Sales qualification is the discipline of rigorously determining which leads are worth pursuing. Most sales problems are actually qualification problems - reps spending time on prospects who will never close. Mastering qualification means treating 'no' as a successful outcome that saves time for better opportunities.

Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 1 experts.

1 Recognize that qualification is the primary skill  If you spend your time on the wrong leads, all that effort produces zero results. Qualification isn't just one part of sales - it's the foundational skill that determines whether everything else matters. Get this wrong and nothing else you do well will save you.

Featured guest perspectives

"It's qualification. Qualification because if you spend your time on the wrong leads, that equates to a zero."

— Jen Abel        2 Be aggressive about getting to yes or no  The goal of early conversations is to determine fit as quickly as possible. Don't nurture maybes - push for a clear yes or no on the first call. A quick 'no' is a successful outcome because it frees you to pursue better opportunities. The worst outcome is lingering in uncertainty.

Featured guest perspectives

"I am a qualification crazy person. I will not get in on another call with someone because on the first call it's either a yes or a no, there's no in between."

— Jen Abel        3 Value 'no' as a successful outcome  Reframe how you think about rejection. A 'no' isn't a failure - it's qualification working correctly. Every unqualified lead you exit quickly is time saved for qualified ones. The best salespeople are disqualification machines.
