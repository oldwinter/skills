Shipping Products  Shipping products is the discipline of getting working software into users' hands. It matters because strategy without execution is hallucination—high-quality ideation is worthless if the team lacks the velocity to actually release products. The faster you ship, the faster you learn, and learning is the only way to discover what actually works.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 47 experts.

1 Treat shipping speed as the primary metric  Increased shipping frequency increases the statistical likelihood of hitting the desired outcome. Monitor how fast it takes to get things to market and treat output as a key indicator of potential success. Ask teams 'What did you deliver this sprint?' to maintain focus. Weekly shipping velocity and tangible progress are the best predictors of long-term success.

Featured guest perspectives

"If you're also not shipping a lot of things to market quickly enough, then it just doesn't matter that much... the more tries you have at it, the likelier you are to get it right."

— Nikita Miller    "Get it out as fast as you possibly can. Everything they tell you about making sure that you get a product out really quickly is totally true. The faster you get it out, the more feedback you get. That is a positive thing."

— Dylan Field    "One good indicator is if each new Office Hour there is really exciting new stuff, right? We're not talking about the same thing we talked about two weeks ago... progress on this weekly or biweekly timescale is a really good indicator of someone who'll succeed."

— Gustaf Alstromer        2 Ship early to production, even internally  Deploy features to production within the first week of development, hidden behind internal flags. You won't know what to polish until after you ship. Use the live product internally to discover UX friction points that aren't visible in design mocks. Aim to have a functional, testable version within the first 10% of the total project timeline.

Featured guest perspectives

"We actually believe that when you start building the thing you actually start realizing more how it should work... Just put it there in, I don't know, the first week almost. After you have some designs in place or some design ideas, just put it into the app and ship it to production."

— Karri Saarinen    "What it really looks like is you have some rough time budget for how long you think something's going to take. By the time 10% of it has passed, after week one, you have something that works that tests some kind of key hypothesis internally."

— Nan Yu    "You won't know what to polish until after you ship. And I think that is uniquely true in an environment where the properties of your product are emergent and not knowable in advance."

— Nick Turley        3 Embrace 'worse is better' to combat perfectionism  A product at 99% completion provides zero customer value—it's effectively 0% done until it's in users' hands. Adopt a 'worse is better' mindset where tech debt is a champagne problem. Ship 'good enough' versions to learn from users rather than polishing in isolation. The only exception is mission-critical products where reliability directly impacts user trust.

Featured guest perspectives

"Worse is better and tech debt is a champagne problem... perfect doesn't exist and you should instead go with good enough because when you ship, that's the moment when you get to learn a lot from your users."

— Julia Schottenstein    "They understand that there needs to be relentless focus on execution, and if something is 99% done, it's closer to 0% rather than 100%."

— Dmitry Zlokazov    "It means you don't need a pixel perfect design. It means you don't need to make sure that all of the little UI bugs and stuff like that are solved because none of that really matters. What matters is you have working software that you can interact with."

— Nan Yu        4 Small, frequent releases beat big launches  Implement CI/CD to enable continuous deployment. Push smaller changes more frequently to reduce the 'blast radius' of potential failures. Speed and stability move together—when you push all the time, changes are smaller, easier to debug, and less risky. Maintain a constant stream of small updates to keep the product feeling 'alive.'

Featured guest perspectives

"Speed and stability move together. Most people only think about this from the speed standpoint, which means when you move faster, you are more stable, which means you're pushing smaller changes more often... you have a smaller blast radius."

— Nicole Forsgren    "In terms of delivery principles, things like small frequent uncoupled releases. For most companies that's CI/CD, instrumentation of everything, monitoring of everything."

— Marty Cagan    "Velocity of shipping is our number one core value in development team. So we do anything and everything to just keep it going up, up, up and into the right."

— Elena Verna        5 Create small, focused teams shielded from chaos  High-velocity shipping requires isolation. Assign teams a single-threaded focus with only one goal. Give them the resources they need, aggressive timelines, and shield them from the chaos of the rest of the organization. The recipe: small teams, lofty goals, tight deadlines, and protection from distractions.

Featured guest perspectives

"I think the recipe for all this is constantly small teams have a single-threaded focus, give them the resources they need to execute big lofty goals, very tight timelines, and then shield them from the chaos that is the rest of the organization."

— Geoff Charles    "The most important thing you have to do in a product is make trade-off decisions... It has to be that you can keep it in somebody's head. So yeah, called the chief engineer."

— Eric Ries        6 Use demos and dogfooding to drive accountability  Foster a 'demo culture' where progress is validated through live products rather than static status reports. Require engineers to own features from development to public announcement. Extensive internal dogfooding turns colleagues into stakeholders who help refine the product and build advocacy before launch. A single working prototype is more persuasive than any slide deck.

Featured guest perspectives

"As part of the GSD updates, hopefully we encourage people to share high fidelity updates, which is not just imagery, but actually a demo... This short circuits a lot of misunderstandings, because you're like 'I'm going to try it.'"

— Farhan Thawar    "I find proof of existence to be an incredibly powerful proof, rather than proof by theory or proof by debate. It's like, 'Look, we did it one time. Hey, I'm holding the piece of paper.'"

— Jeff Weinstein    "I just think about putting things early on staging and getting people involved in the cycle as opening up the doors to the product development process, and hopefully, that just elevates the quality of the product."

— Mihika Kapoor

✗ Common Mistakes

Doing a premature big PR launch before validating that customers actually want the thingLetting excessive feature flags accumulate, creating hidden failure points at launchTreating shipping speed and quality as trade-offs—they actually reinforce each otherAllowing organizational bottlenecks (merge queues, decision-making) to slow velocity while claiming the problem is 'technical'     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Each sprint produces something tangible that users or internal testers can actually tryYour team can articulate what they shipped last week without consulting a roadmapFailed launches are quickly debugged and fixed because the changes were smallSmall, consistent velocity gains are compounding into competitive advantage

"It was a pretty big effort to rewrite Wordle in our tech stack, give people the ability to store their stats and streaks, bring games to all of our major surfaces. We just tried to do it in a thoughtful way, where we didn't break anything."  Tactical:  Rewrite acquired products into the core tech stack for long-term stabilityEnsure core 'magic' features (like streaks) are preserved during migrationIntegrate the product across all major company surfaces

"PR has its time in place, but I think doing it before you have validation that customers definitely want, the thing is quite risky and it can lead to a lot of sun cost once you get it out because you need to see it through."  Tactical:  Validate customer demand through experiments before engaging in major PR or marketing campaigns for a new feature.

"The Sora Android app, like a fully new app, we built it in 18 days and then 10 days later, so 28 days total, we went to the public... number one app in the app store with a handful of engineers. I think it was two or three possibly in a handful of weeks."  Tactical:  Use agents to port code between platforms (e.g., iOS to Android) by having the agent analyze the source and generate implementation plansLeverage agents to handle the 'thick middle section' of the development lifecycle to compress timelines

Ami Vora 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Execution eats strategy for breakfast... if you have great strategy, perfect strategy but poor execution, you don't win because your strategy never makes it to the market. And what's even worse is that you have learned nothing. You don't know whether it was your strategy that was wrong or whether it was your execution that was wrong."  Tactical:  Spend roughly 20% of time on strategy and 80% on execution and validation.Focus on the 'nuts and bolts'—fixing bugs, looking at dashboards, and rewriting specs—to ensure the strategy reaches the customer.

"They understand that there needs to be relentless focus on execution, and if something is 99% done, it's closer to 0% rather than 100%."  Tactical:  Maintain a 'relentless focus on execution' until the product is fully in users' handsTreat nearly-finished projects as '0% done' to avoid premature celebration or loss of focus

"Get it out as fast as you possibly can. Everything they tell you about making sure that you get a product out really quickly is totally true. The faster you get it out, the more feedback you get. That is a positive thing. And now I index on that when we try to build."  Tactical:  Index on speed to market to gather real-world feedback earlierUse internal champions to catalyze the team to close the 'gap' and ship    "We started the company August 2012... summer of 2017 we made our first money. Don't do that. Get to market faster. I wish we had... get something that you can have that people can see the vision of, of where you're going, but don't do what we did. Get to market faster."  Tactical:  Prioritize speed to market over extreme detail-sweating for initial versionsEnsure the product has at least one 'awesome' element that communicates the vision

"Velocity of shipping is our number one core value in development team. So we do anything and everything to just keep it going up, up, up and into the right... we lean on our engineers to do a lot of product work. We call them product engineers, and they have to go and they have to announce the thing that they've shipped."  Tactical:  Require engineers to act as 'product engineers' who own the feature from development to public announcement.Maintain a constant stream of small updates to keep the product feeling 'alive' between major launches.

"The most important thing you have to do in a product is make trade-off decisions... The idea is like, 'This is the person who makes those.' ... It has to be that you can keep it in somebody's head. So yeah, called the chief engineer."  Tactical:  Appoint a single person with moral authority over the product lineEnsure the Chief Engineer understands the trade-offs between departmentsKeep the product vision in one person's head

Gaurav Misra 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Our engineering goal is every engineer should ship a marketable product every week."  Tactical:  Define a 'marketable product' as something unique enough that a user might subscribe specifically for that feature.Avoid shipping 'table stakes' features as the primary weekly goal; focus on unique value.

"I think the recipe for all this is constantly small teams have a single-threaded focus, give them the resources they need to execute big lofty goals, very tight timelines, and then shield them from the chaos that is the rest of the organization."  Tactical:  Assign teams a single-threaded focus with only one goal.Physically or organizationally isolate the team (e.g., a dedicated room) to prevent distractions.Shield the team from company-wide chaos until they find product-market fit.

"Action is the first principle of business. You do stuff and my book is very oriented towards that. The idea was not to tell you what to do, but to give you guideposts while you're on that journey. People that are enthused about it, I encourage you to do stuff."  Tactical:  Prioritize execution and 'doing' to discover the surprises and opportunities that theory cannot predict.

Guillermo Rauch 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"The secret of product quality is blood, sweat, and tears... a great product is made up of a thousand little details and so you're never really done. There's a humility that comes from the process also of why the best product builders will say nine nos for every yes. Because when you say yes, it's like adopting a puppy. A feature is like adopting a puppy. It grows into a beast that you have to take care of."  Tactical:  Apply creative restraint by saying 'no' to 90% of feature ideas.Obsess over the 'thousand little details' through constant dogfooding.

"One good indicator is if each new Office Hour there is really exciting new stuff, right? We're not talking about the same thing we talked about two weeks ago or four weeks ago. They've already done that stuff... progress on this weekly or biweekly timescale is a really good indicator of someone who'll succeed."  Tactical:  Set and hit concrete goals on a 2-week sprint cycle to maintain momentum

"Product managers are the mode of power behind execution and impact. And if you stall out or you don't do your job, the project's probably going to stall out as well. And so you're the ones, especially with a TPM, if you're lucky enough to have one in the back of the ship, kind of beating the drum and driving everyone forward."  Tactical:  Mold the product into a simple, compact package with the highest impact possibleAct as the 'drumbeat' to drive the team forwardEnsure the engineering and design teams are well-resourced and improving every sprint

"In many of those companies, they should focus on creating these sort of areas or pods where a company can, a team can get in the reps that they're trying to be able to do... Shipping and learning, going through the full loop."  Tactical:  Create isolated 'pods' or pilot teams to practice full shipping/learning loops in slow-moving organizations.

"For execution, it would be things like me attending another PMs meeting. 'Oh, I heard this person is amazing at executing. Let me just see how they're on a meeting.' And then you're like, 'Whoa, things we didn't notice.'"  Tactical:  Identify PMs known for excellent execution and ask to shadow their meetings.Take notes on how effective executors handle questions and drive team alignment in real-time.

"Worse is better and tech debt is a champagne problem. And what do I mean by that? It's really to help me combat this perfectionism because perfect doesn't exist and you should instead go with good enough because when you ship, that's the moment when you get to learn a lot from your users."  Tactical:  Adopt a 'worse is better' mindset to combat perfectionism and speed up shipping.Prioritize shipping to learn from users over ironing out every possible edge case in isolation.

"Literally the first two years I was at the company, the stated product strategy for Twitter was refine the core. It was like, we're not making any big bets here, team. Our goal is to keep turning the knobs that are working."  Tactical:  Balance 'knob-turning' optimizations with speculative bets to avoid long-term stagnation.

Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter 1 quote      "The median time from a post going live to a note showing up was five hours, which is like crazy fast. Typical fact checking is like two to four, at least it's really common to see it take two to four days."  Tactical:  Measure and optimize the 'median time to live' for critical product outputsLaunch speed-up features (like matching notes to images) ahead of high-traffic events

"We actually believe that when you start building the thing you actually start realizing more how it should work and how it should be better. A lot of times with the teams we tell them, 'Just put it there in, I don't know, the first week almost. After you have some designs in place or some design ideas, just put it into the app and ship it to production.' It's only visible to us so we internally can test it out."  Tactical:  Deploy features to production within the first week of development, hidden behind internal flags.Use the live product internally to discover UX friction points that aren't visible in design mocks.

Kevin Weil 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We have this philosophy, we call iterative deployment, and the idea is we're all learning about these models together. So there's a real sense in which it's way better to ship something even when you don't know the full set of capabilities and iterate together in public."  Tactical:  Launch research previews to gather real-world dataCo-evolve the product with users as they discover new model behaviors

Kevin Yien 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We were given a pretty strict deadline that we needed to launch by and I pushed it out three times. That's not because of this one animation, but it's because of a series of decisions where we said, 'This is what we believe we need to ship, and this matters much more than hitting some artificial external GA date.'"  Tactical:  Be willing to push back on deadlines if the product hasn't reached the necessary quality bar.Obsess over the final deliverable and whether value is actually reaching the customer.

Manik Gupta 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"How do you get to a very high ship velocity, and the ability to experiment and learn fast. At a broader level, especially during the initial phases, if you're not learning, you are really not doing anything well. You've got to be learning. You've got to be learning good things, bad things, doesn't matter. You've got to be learning. Having the experimentation velocity, having a building culture where engineers are able to check in code, see the results, and then quickly come into another release and stuff like that, I think that's really important for a consumer product."  Tactical:  Build an engineering culture that allows for rapid code check-ins and immediate result visibility.Prioritize 'experimentation velocity' as a key performance indicator for the team.

"In terms of delivery principles, things like small frequent uncoupled releases. For most companies that's CI/CD, instrumentation of everything, monitoring of everything."  Tactical:  Implement CI/CD to enable frequent releases.Ensure every release is instrumented to monitor outcomes and performance.

Matt MacInnis 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"We have a product quality list, which we lovingly at Rippling call the PQL... it articulates in the simplest ways the standards we want you to meet when you ship a product. It doesn't apply to every product, not every line applies to every product, but it's comprehensive and it provides me with a framework for iterating over time as we learn."  Tactical:  Create a 'PQL' checklist of quality standards that must be met before any release.Iterate on the checklist every time a bug or failure slips through to production.    "Feature flags are the bane of my existence... I added a line to the fucking PQL that said, 'You are allowed to have one feature flag that governs your entire product at ship.' It's an extreme standard that might not be achievable, but it's the standard we aspire to."  Tactical:  Limit the number of active feature flags at the time of shipping.Treat feature flags as temporary 'shims' that must be removed to prevent long-term instability.

Mike Krieger 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We really rapidly became bottlenecked on other things like our merge queue... We had to completely re-architect it because so much more code was being written and so many more pull requests were being submitted... I've just found all these new bottlenecks in our system, there's an upstream bottleneck, which is decision making and alignment."  Tactical:  Re-architect merge queues and CI/CD pipelines to handle a massive increase in PR volume.Focus on 'minimum viable strategy' to prevent decision-making from becoming the primary bottleneck.

Nan Yu 3 quotes

"If you look at people who are at the pinnacle of their craft, you can basically tell how good the output is going to be of their work product by how fast they're going. If they're going really fast, and they're obviously not being sloppy and then leaving a mess all over the place, it's like, 'Yeah. Well, they got there because this is just second nature to them,' and they're able to go at a really rapid pace and try stuff."  Tactical:  Index on competence and expertise rather than rushing to achieve speed.Use high speed to increase the number of iterations and variations you can test.    "What it really looks like is you have some rough time budget for how long you think something's going to take. By the time 10% of it has passed, after week one, you have something that works that tests some kind of key hypothesis internally."  Tactical:  Don't wait until the halfway point to have a playable candidate.Validate or invalidate major assumptions in the first week of development.    "It means you don't need a pixel perfect design. It means you don't need to make sure that all of the little UI bugs and stuff like that are solved because none of that really matters. What matters is you have working software that you can interact with, and you can see if it feels good."  Tactical:  Avoid perfectionism in early versions to lower the cost of iteration.Focus on 'shippable elements' that allow for learning rather than production-ready polish.

"I just really want to jump to the punchline of like, 'Okay, why can't we do this now?' or, 'Why can't we do it tomorrow?' ... if this was the most important thing and you wanted to truly maximally accelerate it, what would you do? That doesn't mean that you go do that, but it's really a good forcing function for understanding what's critical path versus what can happen later."  Tactical:  Ask 'What would it take to ship this tomorrow?' to uncover hidden dependenciesSeparate high-velocity product development from rigorous, slower safety processes    "You won't know what to polish until after you ship. And I think that is uniquely true in an environment where the properties of your product are emergent and not knowable in advance. ... shipping is just one point on the journey towards awesomeness, and you should pick that point intentionally where it doesn't have to be the end of your iteration at all."  Tactical:  Ship 'raw' capabilities to gather failure cases that inform future model trainingAvoid over-polishing features before you understand how users will actually employ them

Nicole Forsgren 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Speed and stability move together. Most people only think about this from the speed standpoint, which means when you move faster, you are more stable, which means you're pushing smaller changes more often, right. Because if you're pushing all the time, it's going to be very, very small changes, which means you have a smaller blast radius."  Tactical:  Push smaller changes more frequently to reduce the 'blast radius' of potential failures.Aim for on-demand deployment to ensure that when errors occur, they are easier to debug and mitigate.    "Most teams can move faster. But faster for what? We can ship trash faster every single day. We need strategy and really smart decisions to know what to ship, what to experiment with, what features we want to do in what order and what rollout."  Tactical:  Prioritize strategic decision-making to ensure that increased shipping velocity results in actual value rather than 'trash'.Use rapid shipping capabilities to increase the frequency of learning through experiments.

"if you're also not shipping a lot of things to market quickly enough, then it just doesn't matter that much."  Tactical:  Monitor how fast it takes to get things to marketEnsure output is treated as a key indicator of potential outcomes    "the more tries you have at it, the likelier you are to get it right. So we're not actively monitoring how fast does it take us to ship things to market."

"What we'll wind up doing often is have a team do a two-week customer love sprint, almost like a hackathon, but with that burndown list of what we think is the lowest effort, highest impact changes that we can make to generate more love from our customers... At the end, the goal is to ship all of them. This isn't hacks that you throw away."  Tactical:  Run two-week sprints focused on a burndown list of small, delightful customer requests.Ensure all items in the sprint are intended for production, not just throwaway hacks.

"In my opinion, your tempo framework is more important than your org design. And so if you've ever had a team that seems really, really smart, but they're always planning or they don't really ship a lot... you probably don't have enough alignment on what good looks like in terms of tempo."  Tactical:  Define 'what good looks like' in terms of shipping frequency for every departmentEstablish a 'mission metric' and 'guiding principles' at the leadership level to align shipping goalsIdentify and remove cross-functional friction points that prevent teams from hitting their target tempo

"We have a principle called Ship to Learn. And, we've actually changed it since... Ship fast, ship early, ship often is what it says now... If you ship early, and fast, and learn fast, you can change fast, and you can improve fast."  Tactical:  Adopt a 'Ship to Learn' mindset to mitigate the fear of failure.Ship early to gather real-world data before over-investing in a direction.

Rahul Vohra 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"How much to spend time ahead of launch really does depend on the markets and the structure, the nature of your business model... That's why when you have mission-critical products like email where you are interfacing with customers, with candidates, with investors, it turns out to really matter. Email is mission-critical. It's not something where you can simply launch with a half-baked product."  Tactical:  Assess the 'criticality' of your product before deciding on launch speed vs. polish.Prioritize reliability over speed in markets where failure causes high user anxiety (e.g., email, finance).

"We basically got, I mean, this was probably five to 10 people worth of people originally... We had that for a while, and then we got to a point where it was feeling good, the trusted testers were liking it, reporting good stuff, and then we it to this Labs moment."  Tactical:  Start with a small 'working team' (5-10 people) to prove the concept before scaling.Use a 'trusted tester' group of ~500 people to get honest, critical feedback before a public launch.

"I did not leave the office for the last 22 days, slept for four hours a night upstairs, and if anyone had a question, I could tell them who to talk to. That was so thrilling. It was so thrilling to make those decisions, to cajole this team, none of whom were in it for the money, to make something we were proud of."  Tactical:  Be physically or virtually present during critical launch windows to resolve blockers instantly.Focus on the shared pride of the work to motivate the team through high-pressure periods.

Vikrama Dhiman 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"The very first thing that anyone, when you're starting off, produces is outputs, okay? The output can be launching a product, it can be analyzing and running an experiment, and it could even be just being a part of the team and contributing to a go-to market strategy. So focus on that output significantly."  Tactical:  Focus on shipping products and completing tasks before obsessing over high-level impactVolunteer for 'blocked' tasks like drafting briefs or slides to show immediate utility    "Outputs is shipping products, but it also comes in smaller things. For instance, if you are sourcing content for your homepage, what are the different avenues that you can source content from? What is the easiest to source? What is the most difficult to source? Just ranking it all in that order goes a long way."  Tactical:  Identify small, tangible tasks that unblock leaders or other team membersRank and organize options for a specific problem to simplify decision-making for others

"the speed that we shipped at Seth HQ was just beyond. It just blew away what I think normal people think of as fast, but it was also still so good. And so I think that rigor and that refusal to accept anything but excellence was just so awesome. And it really spoke to me because I care a lot about craft."  Tactical:  Maintain a high bar for quality even when moving at extreme speeds.Refuse to accept anything but excellence in the final output.

"As part of the GSD updates, hopefully we encourage people to share high fidelity updates, which is not just imagery, but actually a demo. ... This short circuits a lot of misunderstandings, because you're like 'I'm going to try it.' And you're not waiting until the end."  Tactical:  Require live demos or video screen shares for weekly project updatesUse cloud development environments to provide 'one-click' access for stakeholders to test new features

"assume you don't know. And the follow up to that value is, 'So we got to get going.' It's like dropping in a new city. You just got to walk out the door of your Airbnb turn left and ... Maybe you'll turn right and then you'll hop on the subway, but you just got to get going and see what you find. And so, we have this attitude of... I've no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea what's going to happen. So we've just got to get going."  Tactical:  Adopt a 'beginner's mind' even for subject matter expertsBias toward 'getting going' over extensive upfront planning

Tactical:  Prioritize operational excellence to ensure strategy can be accurately testedIf a project fails, distinguish between execution failure and strategy failure

"We have a motto in the product org, it's very simple, single sentence, deliver customer value faster with high quality. That's it. Everything that we do... is based on this one single statement and it has three attributes."  Tactical:  Measure 'customer value' by whether the target metric actually moved after shipping.Track cycle times from idea to insight to ensure the team is moving 'faster' relative to their own benchmarks.
