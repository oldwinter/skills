Running Effective Meetings  Running effective meetings is about maximizing the value of synchronous time while minimizing the tax on everyone's calendar. It matters because meetings are the atomic structure of organizational culture—the quality of your meetings determines the quality of your decisions, and poorly run meetings drain energy, kill momentum, and breed cynicism.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 40 experts.

1 Declare the meeting's purpose before it starts  Most meeting dysfunction stems from unclear objectives. Explicitly state whether the meeting is for discovery, discussion, or decision-making. Send an agenda 24 hours in advance with a pre-read. If the meeting is for a decision, identify the decision-maker and the criteria beforehand. If it's for information sharing, consider whether async would be better.

Featured guest perspectives

"The work of a meeting is not calling the meeting. Calling a meeting is easy... People need to know why are we meeting, and what is the point, what's the objective of this meeting? Is it to make a decision? Is it to share information? Who needs to be here?"

— Claire Hughes Johnson    "Clarify what kind of meeting is it. Is it just an update?... Or is it a decision in which case, what are the pros, cons, et cetera?"

— Sriram and Aarthi    "People generally think the purpose of a meeting is for three things, discover, discuss, decide. The only thing that's ever supposed to happen in a meeting is the discussion part."

— Annie Duke        2 Gather input independently before convening  To avoid groupthink and the influence of the loudest voices, collect opinions asynchronously before the meeting starts. Use 'brain writing' where participants submit ideas in writing—ideally anonymously—before discussion begins. Take the first 10-15 minutes of the meeting for silent reading of all contributions. This levels the playing field and prevents the 'founder effect.'

Featured guest perspectives

"The best way to get somebody's opinion is independently of other people's opinions, independently asynchronously. So the way that I put is I want people to stop talking to each other so much."

— Annie Duke    "Brain writing is I'm going to expose an idea and I want everyone to now write and weigh in on there... in an async way that no one else can see until it's all combined, maybe even ideally without authorship identified."

— Jonathan Lowenhar    "You know what would be exquisite? It would be exquisite if everyone pre-prepared their update... If everyone did that, then we could spend the first 15 minutes of the meeting just reading, processing the decisions and we could take a three hour meeting down to a 45 minute meeting."

— Matt Mochary        3 Senior leaders speak last  If you're the most senior person in the room, your opinion carries disproportionate weight. Wait until everyone else has shared their perspective before contributing your own view. Go around the table and explicitly ask each lead for their input. This ensures you hear unbiased opinions and signals that you value team contribution over hierarchy.

Featured guest perspectives

"First he does not speak until everybody around the table speaks. So he goes around to all his leads and said, 'What do you think? What do you think? What do you think?'... And he always spoke last. He is by far the smartest person I've ever met in my life... But he wants to make sure that it's a team effort."

— Tamar Yehoshua    "I really try to spend more time being mindful of that and say, I want to hear from other people first. I want to create space and I don't need to win the argument in the meeting."

— John Mark Nickels        4 Summarize frequently and keep decisions visible  Don't let discussions spiral. Pause periodically to summarize what's been heard and the proposed direction. Use a visual anchor—a projected document or slide—and edit it in real-time to reflect decisions made. This prevents misalignment and ensures latecomers can immediately see the current state.

Featured guest perspectives

"The first step that I found as very useful, and I use this tactic every single day in meetings, is just summarization. So, bringing people together, lots of different voices into a room and hearing what they have to say and at various times in the conversation summarizing what people are saying."

— Anneka Gupta    "I will often have a visual in a meeting. I will leverage that visual to literally real time edit what is being decided. For example, if we have multiple options, I will edit the slide that's being projected to say, 'We decided on option one, here are the next steps, 1, 2, 3.'"

— Naomi Gleit        5 End with three questions  Never close a meeting without explicit alignment on outcomes. Ask: 'What did we decide here?' to surface differing interpretations. Ask: 'Who needs to do what by when?' to assign clear action items with owners. Ask: 'Who else needs to know?' to identify stakeholders who need to be informed. This prevents 're-meetings' and maintains momentum.

Featured guest perspectives

"My three questions to end the meeting are, what did we decide here? Who needs to do what by when? And who else needs to know?"

— Alisa Cohn    "The best salespeople never leave a meeting without a next step. The next step does not have to be a check... but what's the next meeting?... Whatever the next step is, 'What's the next step we can get on our books?'"

— Jason M Lemkin        6 Aggressively eliminate unnecessary meetings  A full calendar is a badge of shame, not honor. Move status updates to async channels. Ban meetings over 10 people unless absolutely necessary. Periodically delete all recurring meetings to reset 'meeting debt.' Don't let decisions wait for the next scheduled meeting—if something needs to be decided, decide it now.

Featured guest perspectives

"The second thing that I would say is the biggest waste of time is meetings and status updates... I've never had a status meeting. I've never scheduled a status meeting. Statuses are done async."

— Geoff Charles    "Once a year at a random time, we will delete all recurring meetings that have more than two people, so not one-on-ones, and are internal people only... it forces you to rethink, 'Do we need a recurring meeting?'"

— Farhan Thawar    "I am really thoughtful that reoccurring meetings do not drive next steps. It's a very tactical thing, but when somebody says, 'Oh, we'll discuss this or we'll decide this in the next meeting,' it's, 'No, we should discuss this now.'"

— Claire Vo

✗ Common Mistakes

Using meetings for status updates that could be shared asyncSkipping the 'priming' phase and jumping straight to decisions without establishing contextLetting the meeting size grow unchecked—every additional person reduces candorEnding without clear decisions, action items, and owners     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Attendees know the meeting type (update, brainstorm, decision) before they joinPeople come prepared with pre-reads completed and opinions formedDecisions are captured visibly during the meeting, not reconstructed afterwardYour calendar has open blocks for deep work, not wall-to-wall recurring meetings

"My three questions to end the meeting are, what did we decide here? Who needs to do what by when? And who else needs to know?"  Tactical:  Ask 'What did we decide here?' to surface differing interpretationsDefine clear action items with owners and deadlinesIdentify stakeholders who need to be informed of the decisions    "If you're in a meeting with a large executive team... you probably want to get a few people just to... I would just even say as a facilitator, two or three people, 'Okay, two or three people, what do we decide here?' And if you can kind of get common, great."  Tactical:  Designate a 'meeting czar' to handle follow-upLeave 5-10 minutes at the end specifically for these closing questionsIf time is short, put the decisions on a screen and ask for verbal confirmation

Annie Duke 3 quotes

Listen to episode →

"People generally think the purpose of a meeting is for three things, discover, discuss, decide. The only thing that's ever supposed to happen in a meeting is the discussion part."  Tactical:  Separate the meeting into three phases: Discover, Discuss, and Decide.Ensure the 'Discuss' phase is the only part that happens live in the room.    "The best way to get somebody's opinion is independently of other people's opinions, independently asynchronously. So the way that I put is I want people to stop talking to each other so much."  Tactical:  Gather opinions asynchronously before the meeting starts.Prevent the 'loudest' or 'most confident' person from dominating the discovery of ideas.    "So what I heard you say is that not all functions are created equal... Is that what you meant? And then they have the ability to say, 'Yes, that is what I meant'... you're reflecting back what they say without offering your own opinion."  Tactical:  Use active listening to reflect back a participant's point verbatim or summarized.Ask for clarification ('Is that what you meant?') before moving to the next person.

Tactical:  Pause circular discussions to summarize what has been heard and the proposed direction.Use whiteboards or Zoom chat to summarize points live without interrupting the flow of conversation.End a summary with a question to invite dissent and ensure the portrayal is accurate.

"When you first start, it might take a half hour, but after that it should just take 10 minutes... It's all about those conversations about, is our current strategy, not just at the company level, but at each departmental level, are these strategies working?"  Tactical:  Keep weekly OKR check-ins to 10 minutes by focusing only on the most important 'big rocks'.Use the meeting to discuss if the strategy is moving the numbers, not to list every IC task.

Elizabeth Stone 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"If we're clear on the objectives of something, it might be that the last 20% of polish on the document is a really bad use of time... The reason we're doing the quarterly business review is to have a really candid conversation about how we think things are going... It's not to have a perfectly polished document for that conversation."  Tactical:  Set expectations that documents should be 'crisp' but not over-polished at the expense of strategic thinkingFocus meeting preparation on 'teeing up' the right debate rather than perfect formatting

Eric Simons 1 quote

"We all meet every day. Pretty much the entire team gets on a call... every day at 8:00 AM Pacific, we're on a Zoom for at least an hour... everything, every day, is being audited front to back, and being discussed front to back."  Tactical:  Use daily syncs to audit all company activities during hyper-growth phasesPrioritize communication fidelity over 'meeting cost' when the company is scaling rapidly

Evan LaPointe 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Meetings, generally speaking, are a combination of priming and decision making... A lot of meetings skip the priming step altogether. They launched directly into decision making."  Tactical:  Explicitly include a priming phase in every meeting to ensure everyone is on the same page.Use the meeting invite to define the category of conversation (e.g., creative problem solving vs. tactical efficiency).    "It's way better to have a debate about the principles than it is to have a debate about the tactics that are rooted in the fact that you have super misaligned principles."  Tactical:  Start meetings by debating and agreeing on the principles that will guide the decision.Identify if a conflict is tactical or actually a misalignment of core objectives.

Tactical:  Reserve meetings only for collaboration, ideation, and decision-making.Check Slack only at the top of the hour and turn off notifications during deep work.Use Slack 'snooze' or 'reminders' to manage tasks without losing focus.

Hari Srinivasan 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I'm trying this thing... could we get to 15-minute reviews basically instead of an hour and see if that alleviates some of this? I'm very curious to see if this is going to be a different kind of system where we might be able to get to clarity quicker, or realize we're not at clarity and then break and come back."  Tactical:  Experiment with 15-minute product reviews to increase focus and speedIf clarity isn't reached quickly, end the meeting and reschedule rather than dragging it out

Hilary Gridley 1 quote

"Every additional person in a meeting has a cost, because every additional person in a meeting makes the people in that meeting less candid than they would have been if there were fewer people in that meeting. ... It's really important that you earn your place in this meeting and let's work on how to do that."  Tactical:  Limit meeting attendance to maintain high levels of candor.Require attendees to contribute value (e.g., moving the conversation forward) rather than just observing.Encourage junior members to practice the skill of verbal expression in meetings to earn their spot.

"The big idea with a design Sprint is to go from a zero to a prototype and a test of that prototype in just five days. And it's a recipe, it's a scripted set of activities that we developed over a number of many years."  Tactical:  Follow a scripted set of activities to move from idea to tested prototype in five days.Clear the team's calendar for a full week to focus on a single problem.

So the core team come together for 10 hours roughly and go through a sequence of activities so that we can make all of the key decisions together."  Tactical:  Clear the team's calendar for 10 hours (spread over two days) to execute a Foundation Sprint.Turn off Slack and email during these sessions to maintain deep focus.

Joe Hudson 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"One of the things I like to say about how to change a company is that the atomic structure of a company is the meetings and the decisions. ... One of the things we do is we talk about what we call five-star meetings, which is how do you make every meeting enjoyable? Literally, how is it that everybody when they walk out of a meeting, they're like, oh, fuck, that was great?"  Tactical:  Set a goal for every meeting to be 'five stars' (highly enjoyable for all participants).Use 'sucking' meetings as a diagnostic tool—if a meeting is unenjoyable, it indicates a deeper problem in that specific area of the business.

Jonny Miller 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"If you are about to jump on a zoom or something, you can totally do it with your eyes closed. Things like expanding your awareness or bringing your awareness down to your feet and your hands, which creates a kind of grounding calming effect that also you can do if you're in a busy room."  Tactical:  Bring awareness to your feet and hands to create a grounding effect during stressful meetingsUse the 'APE' (Awareness, Posture, Emotion) check-in before starting a call to assess your baseline state

John Mark Nickels 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I really try to spend more time being mindful of that and say, I want to hear from other people first. I want to create space and I don't need to win the argument in the meeting. There can be a follow-up. It's not like this is my last chance to say something, but that's also more true when you're more senior because when you're more junior, it's like, well, this is the one presentation I have with Dara for the next six months."  Tactical:  Wait to speak until others have shared their perspectivesCreate explicit space for junior team members to disagree or contribute    "I like a crisp dock and a messy meeting. The whole Amazon thing, if you have the three-page or seven-page narrative, it's written with the clarity of angels singing from on high, at least describing how the problem statement or feature or whatever. And so it's super crisp and organized and well articulated. And then you might have a meeting where you pick it apart and you talk a lot."  Tactical:  Require a crisp, well-articulated narrative document before the meeting startsUse the meeting time for deep discussion and picking apart the document rather than just presenting it

"Brain writing is I'm going to expose an idea and I want everyone to now write and weigh in on there... in an async way that no one else can see until it's all combined, maybe even ideally without authorship identified. Then when the founders weigh in, you don't know, they're just a part of the mass."  Tactical:  Have participants write their ideas in a shared doc or survey before the meeting.Keep authorship anonymous during the initial review phase to level the playing field.Take the first 10 minutes of the meeting for silent reading of all contributions before debating.

Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter 1 quote      "There is a very long-running doc that has had to be chopped and purged... It's really where we coordinate what we're doing. The team meets on a daily basis, we spend whatever amount of time we need to get on the same page about what we're building."  Tactical:  Use a single Google Doc to track daily coordination, goals, and roadmap changesAvoid heavyweight task management tools (Jira/Asana) in favor of lightweight, text-based coordination

Lane Shackleton 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"We built Catalyst to really solve those two problems [standing attendees and single-threadedness]. And so the way it works is it's essentially three one hour blocks throughout the week, and the assumption is that the whole company is free. So you can get anyone in the company for those three hours. And each topic has essentially four roles. Driver, maker, braintrust, and interested... the day before, that hold that's on calendar gets removed, and then you have specific topics that get added. So there may be three topics going all at the same time because they don't have overlapping attendees."  Tactical:  Set company-wide calendar holds for review blocks.Assign roles for each topic: Driver, Maker, Braintrust, and Interested.Run parallel sessions if attendees don't overlap to increase throughput.    "The core idea is have a group one-on-one with the key stakeholders... we'll have a tag-up with a small set of people from a given team... and then they meet with their braintrust and it's once a week. It's the same mindset of a one-on-one. It's their time. So anything that they need to unblock a decision or to make progress, they should use that time for."  Tactical:  Schedule weekly 'Tag-ups' for the product triad (PM, Eng, Design) and their braintrust.Use a 'Dory' (upvoted Q&A table) to prioritize the most important topics for the group.

"Moving away from meeting culture and being able to be in a position where we can work async, whether it's one-hour sprint over Slack, make decisions and go back and forth, 20 people, and then everyone's made a decision by the end of the hour and we're moving forward."  Tactical:  Replace some meetings with one-hour Slack sprints for rapid decision-making.Focus on getting everyone's 'head into the moment' rather than over-processing with complex tools.

"You can actually set up a lot of your communication situations, a presentation, a meeting, et cetera, as conversations. ... For example, what would it be like if you were to start a presentation by saying, 'Today I have three questions I'd like to answer. Question number one is...' And you state the question and then you answer it."  Tactical:  Structure meeting segments as answers to specific questionsUse a 'facilitator' mindset rather than a 'presenter' mindset to ease into the content

Matt Mochary 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"You know what would be exquisite? It would be exquisite if everyone pre-prepared their update, which said how they're doing against their priorities, regular green, what they did last week, what they're going to do this week, and then they pre-route any problems they saw in the company and any proposed solution they had for those problems. If everyone did that, then we could spend the first 15 minutes of the meeting just reading, processing the decisions and we could take a three hour meeting down to a 45 minute meeting."  Tactical:  Require attendees to submit written updates and proposed solutions before the meeting.Dedicate the first part of the meeting to silent reading and processing rather than verbal presentations.

Mayur Kamat 2 quotes

"The leadership team, for example, met every day, and because the leadership team was spread across the world, we met at 11:00 PM when I was in Singapore every day... which meant that none of the decisions were blocked for more than 24 hours."  Tactical:  Implement a 'daily meeting' for urgent, high-priority projects to maintain momentum.Ensure the owner of an urgent problem has all hands on deck and reports updates daily.    "A full calendar is a badge of shame, not a badge of honor."  Tactical:  Maintain open blocks in your calendar to allow for deep dives into high-leverage issues.Avoid filling your schedule with recurring one-on-ones and status meetings if you want to be effective.

"In the early days we'd stand up and everyone would present their goals... and then they started to become six hours long because we had so many people and so many teams. And so trying to find that right flavor at every stage of scale is definitely hard."

Nikhyl Singhal 1 quote

"Sometimes I realize that at a scaled organization, the meeting operating system is as important as the products that we're building because it sort of speaks to how we scale and how we ensure we have the right degree of delegation, the right conversations, and then the right acceleration on the right decisions."  Tactical:  Treat your meeting structure as a product (e.g., 'Version 7.0') and reboot it every 90 daysDefine the cadence, attendees, and decision-making protocols for every recurring meetingWhen joining a new org, use your 'fresh eyes' to identify and fix meeting inefficiencies first

"We are using a reading format of meeting. So it's a doc reading. We just read in comments and understanding the context again. It is the doc, bring everybody together, and then we discuss the things that we want to make a decision with or the things that we feel is a blocker or things that we need to celebrate."  Tactical:  Use a 'doc reading' format where participants read and comment on a document before discussing.Include cross-functional members (Eng, Product, Sales) in the same context-setting meetings.

"I would give you an interesting one that I use a lot in my prior company and then I use a different form of it here in Waymo is what I used to call as the rule of seven. If there have been seven emails in an email thread and you still haven't resolved the issue, just call the person or get in a room huddle, resolve it live."  Tactical:  Implement a 'Rule of 7' (or 10): if an issue isn't resolved after that many emails, force a live meeting or call.Identify when a thread is no longer converging and move it to a real-time discussion.

"a simple exercise of weekly focus. What are you focused on this week? And then reflecting on, did you get done the things you were focused on last week? Seems super simple, but just the exercise of thinking about what matters, writing it down, and having a little bit of social proof or articulating it out to others creates some degree of accountability"  Tactical:  Have team members post their weekly focus in a shared channel on Mondays.Include a reflection on whether the previous week's focus areas were completed.

"the state change method is that you should punctuate your monologues with state changes. So state changes are anything that shakes your audience awake and adds some variety. So it might be asking people to put something in the chat box. It might be switching from gallery view... to screen share... It might be having someone else speak."  Tactical:  Punctuate monologues with a 'state change' every 3-5 minutes.Use tools like Zoom chat, polls, breakout rooms, or switching between screen sharing and gallery view.    "If you even take 30 seconds to one minute to ground yourself on why am I in this meeting? What do I want to share and make sure I get across in the time that we have, you're going to go in there so much more focused."  Tactical:  Spend 60 seconds before a call defining your goal for the meetingDecide beforehand what specific point you want to ensure you contribute

And if it's just a status update, that's fine, then I can read that asynchronously at a time that works for me."  Tactical:  Move all status updates to asynchronous tools or emailEnsure every meeting has a clear problem-solving objectiveProtect deep work time by syncing leadership calendars to have long stretches of meeting-free hours

"We have one weekly sort of strategic meeting. It's more open-ended, there is time for discussion. It's longer and it's sort of more unstructured. We also have one weekly operational meeting, which is highly structured where we go through all of the priority projects."  Tactical:  Schedule a structured weekly operational meeting for project updatesSchedule a separate, longer, unstructured meeting for strategic discussion    "I will often have a visual in a meeting. I will leverage that visual to literally real time edit what is being decided. For example, if we have multiple options, I will edit the slide that's being projected to say, 'We decided on option one, here are the next steps, 1, 2, 3.'"  Tactical:  Project a document or slide during the meetingEdit the projected content in real-time to reflect decisions made    "What I will do is send an agenda 24 hours prior to the meeting. That agenda will include a pre-read... During the meeting... I think it's really important for a group of people to be looking at something and anchoring people on something."  Tactical:  Send an agenda and pre-read at least 24 hours before the meetingUse a visual anchor so latecomers can immediately see the current topic    "After the meeting... within 24 hours post-meeting I will send the notes, reply all to the meeting invite and send the notes.

"I use Asana to run all my meetings and assign pre-reads. So I use the multi-assign feature in subtasks all the time where I make a task with a due date that says, 'Read this thing by this date,' and then I assign it to a team or a set of individuals like that really quickly."  Tactical:  Assign pre-reads as tasks with specific due dates before the meeting.Take live notes in a shared task and convert them into subtasks for immediate follow-up.

"First he does not speak until everybody around the table speaks. So he goes around to all his leads and said, 'What do you think? What do you think? What do you think?'... And he always spoke last. He is by far the smartest person I've ever met in my life... But he wants to make sure that it's a team effort and that he's listening to what everybody in his organization thinks."  Tactical:  Go around the table and ask every lead for their opinion before sharing your own.    "We had a Slack channel for each team, their OKRs, a planning channel for each one. And people would post a doc and then a Slack video of going through the major points. And we had a time limit of how long they were allowed to be... And then Cal and I would do a marathon and we would watch them all together."  Tactical:  Use a dedicated channel for each team's planning.Require teams to post a document and a short video summary (e.g., Slack Clips) instead of a live presentation.Only schedule follow-up meetings for high-priority projects or those with many questions.
