Writing PRDs  A PRD is the artifact that aligns engineering, design, and business on what to build and why it matters. The best PRDs don't just describe features. They force clarity on the customer problem, create a shared mental model for the team, and serve as the source of truth throughout development. In the AI era, PRDs are evolving from static documents to interactive prototypes.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 11 experts.

1 Start with the 'why' and 'why now'  The most important section of your PRD is the first one: background, context, and the problem you're solving. Your team needs to understand not just what they're building, but why this problem matters and why it's urgent to solve it now. If you can't articulate this clearly, you're not ready to write a PRD.

Featured guest perspectives

"The most important section in my opinion in the document is the first part, which is like what is the background and context? What is the problem, why does it matter and why does it matter now?"

— Maggie Crowley    "Whenever we're devising a new product or feature, we're going to start by writing a press release describing the feature and describing it in a way that speaks to the customer... in my description of this, it better jump off the page of something like, wow, as a customer I will really need this."

— Bill Carr        2 Write for clarity, not comprehensiveness  The goal of a PRD is alignment, not documentation for its own sake. Keep it minimal enough that people actually read it. Focus on defining key outcomes rather than every detail. A PRD that sits unread in Confluence is worse than a short doc that the whole team references daily.

Featured guest perspectives

"Unless there's something that's very sophisticated that we're working on, we tend to keep them pretty light. I like to just have the minimal amount of context possible, that just ensures everyone's on the same page and that the key outcomes for whatever feature that we're working on, are going to be present when we get there."

— Eric Simons    "What I work first is to say, okay, for your product development process, let's start by using this method as the method to decide what am I going to go build? And oh, by the way, to use it as a method to sort between a lot of different choices of what you might build."

— Bill Carr        3 Replace static specs with prototypes and demos  The traditional written PRD is being replaced by functional artifacts. Instead of describing what a feature should do, show it. Use AI tools to build interactive prototypes that demonstrate error states, success states, and animations. 'Demos before memos' accelerates alignment and reduces ambiguity.

Featured guest perspectives

"In this day and age, if you're not prototyping and building to see what you want to build, I think you're doing it wrong. I call it the prompt sets of the new PRDs. I really insist on folks saying if you're building new projects, new features of course come with prototypes and prompt sets."

— Aparna Chennapragada    "The product management team is fascinating, because now they're actually building the product... we've specced out in v0, think of it as like a live PRD, we've specced out how the new functionality for deploying a v0 to Vercel is going to work. The amount of detail that was contained in that v0... we're all just saying, 'Well, just ship it. There's nothing else to discuss.' It was animated, it was interactive."

— Guillermo Rauch        4 Use AI to accelerate drafting, not replace thinking  AI can scaffold the basics of user stories, out-of-scope items, and technical requirements. Use it to turn rough notes or voice memos into structured documents. But the high-level narrative and the 'why' still require human judgment. Let AI handle the commodity work while you focus on the strategic framing.

Featured guest perspectives

"I had used ChatGPT and a prompt to come up with a very serviceable PRD spec for this very technical product... Use AI to scaffold the basics of user stories and out-of-scope items... Include a 'narrative' section in PRDs to pitch the product's value."

— Claire Vo    "In a Claude Code world, where you're not coding a lot, you end up spending a lot of time essentially typing PRDs... you could spend a little bit of time being like... I'm going to write a prompt that can take my rambling thoughts and then turn that into a PRD."

— Dan Shipper    "Can Claude be a partner in figuring out what to build? What the market size is if you want to approach it that way? What the user needs are if you look at a different way? ... Models can do that today."

— Mike Krieger        5 Treat the PRD as a living document  Your PRD is not a contract frozen in time. It's a home base that evolves as you learn. Keep a running log of decisions and trade-offs. Update requirements based on discovered failure modes. For AI products especially, executable evaluations are becoming the real source of truth for what the product should do.

Featured guest perspectives

"You're never going to know what the failure modes are going to be upfront... PRDs are a great abstraction for thinking about this. It's not the end all, be all. It's going to change."

— Hamel Husain & Shreya Shankar    "This is the purest sense of what a product requirements document should be, is this eval judge that's telling you exactly what it should be, and it's automatic and running constantly."

— Hamel Husain & Shreya Shankar    "Keep a running log of decisions and trade-offs within the document... Use the document as a 'home base' for all related research and artifacts."

— Maggie Crowley

✗ Common Mistakes

Writing 'beefy' PRDs that no one reads because they're too longJumping straight to solutions before clearly defining the problemTreating the PRD as a one-time deliverable instead of a living documentDescribing features in text when an interactive prototype would be clearerNeglecting the 'why now' section that justifies timing against other priorities     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Engineers reference the PRD during development without needing to ask clarifying questionsStakeholders can quickly understand the customer problem and proposed solutionThe document serves as a historical record of decisions and trade-offsPRDs are used as a filtering mechanism to decide what not to buildCross-functional teams (care, marketing, design) find the PRD useful for their own work

"Whenever we're devising a new product or feature, we're going to start by writing a press release describing the feature and describing it in a way that speaks to the customer and to some degree the external press and world where the idea is, in my description of this, it better jump off the page of something like, wow, as a customer I will really need this."  Tactical:  Write a mock press release (PR) and a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) before buildingUse the PR to describe the customer, the problem, and the solution in factual, data-rich languageInclude a hypothetical launch date to signal the project's complexity    "What I work first is to say, okay, for your product development process, let's start by using this method as the method to decide what am I going to go build? And oh, by the way, to use it as a method to sort between a lot of different choices of what you might build."  Tactical:  Create a 'product funnel' where many PR/FAQs are written but only the best are fundedIterate on documents through 'concentric circles' of review, starting with a small group and expanding

So last night I saw how we've specced out in v0, think of it as like a live PRD, we've specced out how the new functionality for deploying a v0 to Vercel is going to work. The amount of detail that was contained in that v0, I mean, we're all just saying, 'Well, just ship it. There's nothing else to discuss.' It was animated, it was interactive."  Tactical:  Use AI builders to create 'live PRDs' that demonstrate error states, success states, and animations.Move from descriptive text to interactive artifacts to gain stakeholder alignment.

"Is your PRD quality good enough? Are you writing that the draft notes that go and circulate to the care teams, to the marketing teams and so on? ... You must have that impact to impact through the artifacts that you work on."  Tactical:  Ensure PRDs are high-quality and circulate them to cross-functional teams like care and marketingDon't neglect the 'IC roots' of document creation even as you move into leadership    "Can you show me your last PRD? Can you show me the last product note that you sent? Can you show me the product strategy doc that you have or collaborated on? Can you show me the brief that you sent to the design team on the problems and the ranking of those problems? Usually, you'll find something or the other missing."  Tactical:  Audit your recent artifacts (PRDs, strategy docs, design briefs) for quality and completenessEnsure Jira storyboards are descriptive and not just empty titles
