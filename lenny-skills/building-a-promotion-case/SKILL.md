Building a Promotion Case  Promotion should be a recognition of work you're already doing at the next level, not a reward for potential. The most reliable path isn't to optimize for the promotion itself—it's to focus obsessively on business impact while making sure the right people know about it. Paradoxically, the less you want the promotion and the more you focus on impact, the faster it tends to come.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 17 experts.

1 Focus on impact, not the promotion  The people who advance fastest are those solely focused on having the most impact on the company—not on pleasing their manager or gaming the system. When you optimize for the promotion itself, you get caught up in doing what your boss wants rather than what actually moves the business. Impact is the primary metric; promotion follows.

Featured guest perspectives

"The people that I've had work for me or I've worked alongside that seem to always be the outperformers, are always the people that are just solely focused on having the most impact on the company... when you focus too much at a company about like, 'Ooh, I want the promotion' you get caught up in this world where you're like, 'If I want the promotion, I need to do what my boss wants.'"

— Chris Hutchins    "If you simply wake up every day trying to have the biggest impact you can... that's a really good guiding light. And I remember in my first 10 years at Amazon... I never talked to my manager about it... I was just focused on taking my book of business and making it bigger. And then the net result was I was promoted several times."

— Ian McAllister        2 Do the job before you have the title  Promotions should recognize work already being performed at the next level. Practice 'VP things' or 'Director things' before you officially have the title. Volunteer to mentor interns, lead processes, or take on strategic projects that stretch your current responsibilities. When you're already doing the job, the promotion is just paperwork.

Featured guest perspectives

"I am promoting you to do the job, not to learn the job. You're going to work with me over the next couple of months to do those things because I am promoting you to do the job, not to learn the job."

— Christian Idiodi    "A lot of these things you don't need to have the official title to do. You can do a lot of it in that capacity as an IC... If you're a part of a company that's growing and has a summer internship program, awesome. Can you go in and sign up and mentor and intern and manage an intern."

— Julie Zhuo        3 Frame it as solving a company problem  Don't ask for a promotion because you want it—frame it as what the company needs. 'I want to be a director' is weak. 'You have nine direct reports and need leverage—here's a structure that solves that, and I can step into this role' is strong. Make the promotion an easy decision by showing how it addresses an organizational gap.

Featured guest perspectives

"I think the second thing is really the conversation needs to be about what you being in a different position does for the company and why the company needs it. Often the conversation is, 'I want to be promoted because I want to be a director.' Instead of saying, 'Look, your span of control, you have nine direct reports, you need leverage here.'"

— Claire Vo        4 Use the Magic Loop to align with your manager  Build a partnership with your manager: First, do your current job well. Then ask 'How can I help you?' and do whatever they say. Once you've built trust, explicitly state your goal and ask: 'Is there something I can do to help you that would also help me reach my goal?' This creates a win-win path to advancement.

Featured guest perspectives

"The basic idea of The Magic Loop is five steps and they're very easy. The first one is you have to be doing your current job well... Then step two is ask your boss how you can help... Step three is whatever they say, do it... the fourth step is where the magic comes in. You go back to your manager and say, 'Hey, I'm really enjoying working with you. I'm wondering is there some way I could help you that would also help me reach my goal?'"

— Ethan Evans        5 Be known for something specific  Develop a reputation for a specific type of excellence—complex launches, technical depth, stakeholder management. When you're known as 'the person who can do X,' you naturally attract more responsibility and trust from leadership. Visibility matters: no one gets promoted if decision-makers don't know who they are.

Featured guest perspectives

"I think it's really important to become really good at and also known for something. You could be known for shepherding like the most complex launches because you're just so good at quarterbacking... find something that you can be really, really good at. And the reason I give that advice is because when you do that, you can crush the projects that you get because you're making a name for yourself."

— Jiaona Zhang    "There are many ways to get promoted, but I will guarantee you one thing, no one is going to promote Lenny if they don't know who the hell you are... They have to know that you're smart and personable and have whatever skills you've got, but they have to know you."

— Jeffrey Pfeffer        6 Diagnose what's actually blocking you  If you're not getting promoted, it's usually one of four things: lack of advocacy (no one's fighting for you), role availability (the next level doesn't exist), impatience (you haven't been at it long enough), or a development gap you're not seeing. Seek 'ground truth' feedback to identify which one applies to you.

Featured guest perspectives

"I think that the answer of what you do is correlated with what's the real reason. And I think that there may be, I'll suggest four kind of common things I've seen that really hold people back... One is that you just don't have advocacy... The second... is the next role doesn't exist... The third is when you are being impatient... And then the fourth one... is really, there is a development area but it isn't quite connected to the individual."

— Nikhyl Singhal

✗ Common Mistakes

Conflating promotion (short-term leveling) with career (long-term growth)—they're different conversationsAsking 'What do I need to do to get promoted?' instead of 'What would have the most impact?'Using passive language like 'helped' and 'contributed to' instead of quantifying your direct impactWaiting to be noticed rather than proactively building visibility with decision-makers     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Others advocate for you without being askedYou're already doing work at the next level before the title changeYour manager brings you into conversations about organizational needsPeople across the organization know what you're 'known for'

"I am promoting you to do the job, not to learn the job. You're going to work with me over the next couple of months to do those things because I am promoting you to do the job, not to learn the job."  Tactical:  Practice 'VP things' or 'Director things' before you actually have the title.Managers should create a safe environment for reports to practice leadership tasks (like interviewing or strategy) before the official promotion.Use 'Group Product Manager' roles to let individual contributors test management with one report before giving them a full team.

Tactical:  Ensure you are performing at a solid level before asking for moreProactively ask your manager 'What can I do to help you?'Execute on the manager's requests, even if they are maintenance tasks, to build trustExplicitly state your career goals (promotion, raise, or skill) and ask for work that bridges your goal with their needsRepeat the loop to maintain a continuous growth trajectory    "The difference between a senior manager and a director is how you lead and the work you're doing. And you can get as far as senior manager by being really strong in your function and being really good at getting things done. As a director, and as a VP beyond that, it becomes much more about influence, coordination with others, and letting go of being in all the details yourself."  Tactical:  Practice 'next level' skills like strategic project leadership before you have the titleFocus on influence and cross-functional coordination rather than just functional depthLet go of being involved in every detail to demonstrate executive readiness

"Have a conversation with your manager and say, 'I would really like at some point in the future to grow into whatever this goal is... What do you suggest that I work on now so that I'll be ready when the opportunity comes up?'... I'm framing it in the future so that it's not threatening. It's not like going to put my manager on the defensive... And then it brings them onto your side."  Tactical:  Ask: 'What do you suggest I work on now so I'll be ready when the opportunity comes up?'Focus feedback requests specifically on the skills needed for the next level

"The reason why you should pay attention to this is because it leads to a lot of good things, salary, getting promoted, being happy in your career, being less stressed."  Tactical:  Master political skills to improve your chances of advancement and higher compensation.    "There are many ways to get promoted, but I will guarantee you one thing, no one is going to promote Lenny if they don't know who the hell you are. So it is not sufficient for them to know who you are. They have to know that you're smart and personable and have whatever skills you've got, but they have to know you."  Tactical:  Differentiate yourself so that decision-makers are aware of your existence and your specific skills.Ensure you have visibility to match your substance.

"I think it's really important to become really good at and also known for something. You could be known for shepherding like the most complex launches because you're just so good at quarterbacking. Working with go-to--market teams and cross-functional stakeholders that could be like your thing. You could be known for working on the most technically complex problems, find something that you can be really, really good at. And the reason I give that advice is because when you do that, you can crush the projects that you get because you're making a name for yourself, reputation, and then you are giving more responsibility. People tend to flock and give responsibility to the people that are known for being excellent at something."  Tactical:  Identify a specific niche to be excellent at (e.g., complex launches, technical depth, or regulatory complexity)Build a reputation for 'getting shit done' to earn more responsibilityFlex your core strengths as you transition from IC to management

"The problem with it is that you're limited to what your manager's ability is to advocate for you, to promote you. And you're also limited by the explicit trajectory of your role at that company and where the there's room for that or not at the company... The method that I use tries to take that power back a little bit."  Tactical:  Stay close to the customer to gain unique insights that executives lackBring insights to life by aligning them with North Star metricsBuild a brand as the person who 'just knows' the customers to create cross-team opportunities

"I'm a big fan of looking at both the what and the how. So what did they accomplish and how did they accomplish... On the what... it's really about real demonstrated impact. An ideal example is someone who had a strong product hypothesis, they rallied a bunch of people around them... On the how, I just love people who are able to create both energy and create clarity... Then the last thing I would say is followership. Really important for PMs. Do people want to work with them?"  Tactical:  Demonstrate an end-to-end product cycle from hypothesis to measurable impact.Focus on becoming a source of clarity and energy for the cross-functional team.

"I have a friend who does resume coaching, and I showed her my resume a couple of years ago. And she said, 'I love your resume except for one thing. Why do you write like a little girl? Say what you did, say what your contributions were. Don't say 'I helped. I may have maybe helped people do this'. Say the impact. Put the number on it.'"  Tactical:  Avoid using 'helped' or 'contributed to' in favor of direct impact statements.Quantify your results with specific numbers and business outcomes.

"I think that the biggest one in workplace is focusing career and promotion together. I think that there's perhaps a light connection between promotion and career addition, but I feel like too many people are, the moment we talk about career, they're like, 'Well, let me talk to you. I want to have a career talk with you.' And I said, 'Sure, why don't you find some time?' We sit down together and they're like, 'Well, what do you think I need to do to get to promotion?'"  Tactical:  Distinguish between 'promotion talks' (short-term leveling) and 'career talks' (long-term growth)Evaluate if a promotion is actually in service of your 'job after next'    "I think that the answer of what you do is correlated with what's the real reason. And I think that there may be, I'll suggest four kind of common things I've seen that really hold people back... One is that you just don't have advocacy... The second that's very common now... is the next role doesn't exist... The third is when you are being impatient... And then the fourth one... is really, there is a development area but it isn't quite connected to the individual."  Tactical:  Identify if you have an advocate who 'sees the magic' in your workAssess if the organizational structure actually has a vacancy at the next levelSeek 'ground truth' feedback to identify development areas you might be dismissing

Petra Wille 1 quote

"Getting promoted is way harder if you're not good in telling stories and rallying the team behind the shared goal and all these kind of things, and you usually achieve this through good storytelling techniques. And in some teams, I've seen the product person not being really, really good at it, but then the whole team helped creating these stories and stuff like this. So you definitely could compensate to some extent, but I would consider it a bit of a career staller if you don't get to a decent level of storytelling and to a decent level of public speaking."  Tactical:  Master storytelling techniques to rally teams behind shared goalsDevelop public speaking skills to avoid career plateaus

"I'm going to say something that might sound a little cheeky, but I think the way to get promoted is to not want it too badly. It is about you have to focus on the impact. It's about having an impact and then doing what is right for the business. So not sort of optimizing things for your promotion... focus on the impact."  Tactical:  Focus on creating the right outcomes for the business rather than maneuvering for a title.Improve your core product management skillset to naturally qualify for higher levels.Seek out challenging, high-visibility projects that stretch your current skills.

"If you're present in your job, and you actually have fun with it and solve the problems, people will come out of the woodwork, say, 'You're great, and tell your boss you should be promoted.' You don't need to ask for a promotion. Your outcomes should speak for themselves."  Tactical:  Focus on solving high-impact problems that lead others to advocate for your advancement.Prioritize raw connection to the work and team over explicit promotion-seeking.

Tamar Yehoshua 2 quotes

"One of the things that I think is overlooked is do a really good job at whatever your job is at that point. People have a tendency ... Especially product managers are very ambitious and they want to get to the next level and they're always eyeing the next job, but you're not going to get the next job unless you do really well at the job that you're in. Knock it out of the park."  Tactical:  Master the 'table stakes' of your current role: technical knowledge, product understanding, and metrics.    "Are you helping the business move forward? So it's not about I achieve what I was asked to do, but did you build something that people actually used? It's not about just launching something and did you do the right thing for the company? And that is different. It's a different mindset."  Tactical:  Focus on whether your work is actually being used by customers, not just the act of launching.Be willing to suggest shutting down unproductive teams or projects, even if you were meant to lead them.
