Building Sales Team  Building a sales team is one of the highest-leverage decisions a startup makes—and one of the easiest to get wrong. The best sales teams are built on a foundation of founder-led sales learning, deliberate hiring for your specific sales motion, and systems that let reps scale what works.

Read Guide

The Guide  4 key steps synthesized from 14 experts.

1 Founders must sell first to learn the motion  Before hiring salespeople, founders need to close deals themselves. This isn't about saving money—it's about deeply understanding your buyer, refining your pitch, and knowing what 'good' looks like. You can't hire, train, or evaluate salespeople for a motion you haven't mastered.

Featured guest perspectives

"One of the biggest mistakes is hiring salespeople before the founders understand the sales motion... you can't coach what you don't know."

— Des Traynor    "The founder needs to be the first salesperson... until you've done it yourself, you won't know what success looks like or how to hire for it."

— Cassidy Turbin        2 Hire for your specific sales motion, not generic sales experience  A great enterprise seller may fail at PLG-assisted sales and vice versa. Be specific about your sales motion—inbound vs. outbound, transactional vs. complex, SMB vs. enterprise—and hire people with relevant experience. Relevant wins beat impressive titles.

Featured guest perspectives

"You need salespeople who match your sales motion... hiring an enterprise rep for SMB sales or vice versa is a recipe for failure."

— Peter Kazanjy    "The biggest hiring mistake is not matching the sales candidate to your specific sales process... context matters enormously."

— Mark Roberge        3 Build process and playbooks before scaling headcount  Adding more salespeople to a broken process just multiplies the problems. First, document what works: discovery questions, objection handling, demo flow, and follow-up cadences. Then hire people who can execute and improve the playbook rather than reinvent from scratch.

Featured guest perspectives

"You need a repeatable sales process before you scale... otherwise you're just scaling chaos."

— Mark Roberge    "The playbook has to exist before the team... good salespeople will improve it, but they need something to start with."

— Des Traynor        4 Invest heavily in onboarding and ongoing enablement  The difference between a 3-month and 6-month ramp time is massive for your business. Create structured onboarding with clear milestones, pair new hires with top performers, and provide continuous coaching. Sales is a skill that improves with deliberate practice and feedback.

Featured guest perspectives

"Sales enablement is not optional... the companies that win invest heavily in making their reps successful."

— Peter Kazanjy

"In those early days, it's more inbound in nature, and so the type of sales reps you might need are not necessarily going to be outbound, heavy kind of hunting sales reps... making sure that the profile, the folks you're bringing on early match that target buyer in addition to match the motion around how you're going to be acquiring customers."  Tactical:  Hire 'grower' profiles rather than 'hunter' profiles for early inbound-heavy PLG motions.Match the sales rep's background to the target buyer (e.g., don't hire Oracle reps used to CIOs if you are selling to RevOps).

"We shouldn't force the merchant to choose, do you want to talk to sales? You want to do self-service? Should give them the options, whatever path that they want to go on. And so a lot of that has been building into the self-service journey over to sales and then from sales into self-service."  Tactical:  Avoid siloing the sales and self-service funnels; provide 'talk to sales' options within the product onboarding.Rebuild LTV and attribution models to account for users who start in self-service but close via sales.

Ben Horowitz 1 quote

"you're going to have to hire somebody who knows sales... there's a lot of knowledge in how to build a worldwide sales organization; maybe knowledge of customers, territories, territory splitting, rep profiles. There's just a litany of stuff that you really can only learn by doing trial and error"  Tactical:  Hire for specific domain knowledge in territory management and rep profilingDon't assume a smart generalist (like a PhD) can reinvent specialized operational functions efficiently

"Attach to yourself a pilot AE, so account executive, or an SDR and see how that works. You kind of separate yourself from the mothership of the sales engine and you actually prototype this separately in a little bit of a vacuum, not under pressure of them top-down quota relief."  Tactical:  Don't hire salespeople until you feel organic demand (hand-raisers) from the productStart with a blend of SDR and AE roles before specializingConsider using support or customer success teams to close early deals before hiring dedicated sales    "If your money collection is going to happen through sales team primarily, then you absolutely should be hiring sales way before growth. In fact, in the sales led companies, growth teams are not necessarily needed even that much."  Tactical:  Hire sales first if the product requires human-led activation, monetization, and retention.Hire growth first only if you are starting with a self-serve monetization model.

Geoffrey Moore 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Enterprise salespeople are not good chasm crossers because they're used to doing horizontal coverage model... You want somebody that looks more like a sales engineer than a salesperson. You want somebody very diagnostic, very committed to the integrity of the problem solution framework."  Tactical:  Hire 'sales engineer' types for early pragmatic sales rather than high-volume horizontal sellers.Prioritize domain expertise and diagnostic skills over traditional sales 'closing' techniques.

"You need to hire one rep and you've got to hire two because otherwise, there's no A-B test. You have to A-B test humans. You've got to hire two as hard as it is, and there's just one cheat code to those first two."  Tactical:  Hire two reps at the same time to A-B test performanceLook for 'pirates and romantics' who are product savants in the early days    "You need two sales reps hitting quota closing deals before you're ready to hire a manager for them. Almost all VPs of sales, their job is to take you from rep three to 300."  Tactical:  Wait until two reps are hitting quota before hiring a VPHire a 'stretch' VP who was previously a director rather than a seasoned veteran    "In sales, I'm actually not sure what the tip of heuristic is in product... But the thing about sales is there's no efficiency... it's rules of eight. Eight SDRs, outbound reps need one manager, eight AEs, eight sales execs need a director above them."  Tactical:  Maintain a 1:8 ratio of managers to individual contributorsHire a director once you have eight scaled AEs

Jen Abel 3 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I have this theory that maybe you shouldn't hire any salespeople until series A, right? Because seed is all about experimentation and proving out that experiment, and then obviously series A is about exploiting that learning."  Tactical:  Wait until the sales motion is repeatable and the 'experiment' is proven before hiring non-founder sales staff.    "I always say you need people that can cosplay a founder, which is selling the vision, getting them excited, running through a wall to get the deal done and getting creative on ... None of my deals look exactly the same, every deal looks different and that's okay because every organization has slightly different opportunities."  Tactical:  Look for hires with founder experience or deep product/engineering backgrounds rather than just traditional sales experience.Hire two salespeople at once to compare performance, given the high failure rate (50%+).    "It's usually 50/50. So it's 50% OTE. So it's 50% base salary, 50% OTE... In technology, it could be anywhere between eight and 12%. So rounds out around 10%."  Tactical:  Structure incentives so salespeople see the potential for high earnings, which drives enthusiasm.

Melissa Tan 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We would hire a ton of really smart people that had never done sales and had them do sales. There are a lot of disadvantages to that, but I do think it led to a ton of innovation. That's how we got our very innovative go-to market motions because a lot of those people then moved into different functions at the company."  Tactical:  Hire 'first principles thinkers' rather than just experienced sales reps for early motionsUse early sales roles as a training ground for future product and growth leaders

Merci Grace 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"The point at which you should start to hire someone else to do that is when you, as the founder, absolutely cannot meet the demand... And then the other time to do that, apart from just being maxed out, is when you are moving in to and usually up to a customer that both wants and expects to meet with a salesperson."  Tactical:  Wait to hire sales until the founder is physically unable to handle the lead volume.Listen for customer signals that they expect a formal sales process before buying.

Pete Kazanjy 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Generally speaking, it is to contingent on your sales motion, but it's going to be that you can reliably, at a pretty okay win rate, so maybe 15% or 20% or 25%, turn first meetings into eventual customers and do that in a reliable fashion. It's not like, "I engaged 10 arms-length parties and I got two customers closed." It's like, "Hey, that's great. That's a good start. 5X that, 10X that.""  Tactical:  Measure your win rate from first meeting to closed dealEnsure you are selling to 'arms-length' prospects, not just friends or family, before hiringWait until the sales motion is statistically significant and repeatable    "Generally, what you want to do is you probably don't want to start with a VP of sales to start... what you want to do is you want to hire a couple early-stage pioneer sellers to take that sales motion. The downside of seeking to hire a VP of sales... is that person hasn't been selling for a hot second."  Tactical:  Hire two sellers simultaneously to compare performance and avoid single-point-of-failure biasLook for 'deputies' or early sellers from successful companies in your spaceTarget candidates who have sold to the same persona at a similar price point

Sahil Mansuri 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"What we haven't done is built a modern technical sales compensation plan that actually aligns the needs and incentives of the business, the customer and the rep... I think that setting up a longer horizon where if the customer you sign up today ends up renewing tomorrow, the rep should get a kicker on it."  Tactical:  Align incentives between the customer, the business, and the repIncorporate 'kickers' or bonuses for customer renewals into the AE comp planMeasure and reward reps based on the renewal rates of the customers they sign

"we've had this team for almost two years now that that's been working on sales automation and data to just make our sales teams more efficient."

Varun Mohan 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We hired our VP of sales over a year ago actually. And the go-to-market team is now over 80 people inside the company... if you want to sell to the Fortune 500, it is very hard to do that purely by swiping a credit card."  Tactical:  Hire a sales leader early if the target market includes large, security-conscious enterprisesBuild a sales process that addresses enterprise-specific needs like security, compliance, and personalization

Jeanne Grosser 3 quotes

"The litmus test I have always given my sales team is if you are an account executive in my org and I put you in front of 10 engineers at our company, it should take them 10 minutes to figure out you aren't a product manager."  Tactical:  Hire sales profiles that can pass for product managers in front of engineering teams.    "SDR is typically in charge of generating pipeline... account executives are closers. It's their job to take somebody from, 'Okay, hey, I'm interested in learning about your solution, I have a legitimate problem. I potentially could make a decision,' to, 'I now believe that your product is the best in the market for me and I'm willing to pay for it.'"  Tactical:  Differentiate between inbound SDRs (qualifying leads) and outbound SDRs (generating interest).    "I strongly believe that sales is a skill and so you want salespeople with actual sales experience in your organization, but I think there's value in pairing them with more nontraditional backgrounds, in particular consulting or banking background. Those folks are really good at more quantitative and analytical aspects of sales."  Tactical:  Hire a mix of traditional sales experience and analytical backgrounds like consulting or banking.
