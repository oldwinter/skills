Designing Growth Loops  Growth loops are self-reinforcing systems where the output of one cycle becomes the input of the next. Unlike linear funnels, loops compound over time and create sustainable, defensible growth engines. The best companies typically scale through one dominant loop they've mastered.

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 54 experts.

1 Map your loops before optimizing  Start by documenting the micro and macro loops driving your business. Understand the action-reaction cycles: how do users acquire other users? How does revenue fund more acquisition? This qualitative model creates shared understanding and guides investment decisions. Use data to identify which part of the loop is the current biggest constraint.

Featured guest perspectives

"Being able to identify the various micro and macro loops, how they're all connected, being able to document them in a qualitative model to communicate a shared understanding of how you grow, it's really powerful."

— Ben Williams    "Growth loop modeling. So really understanding how you grow and where you should be spending your time. What acquires users? What retains them? What monetizes them?"

— Adam Fishman        2 Build loops into the product, not around it  The most powerful growth loops are embedded in the product itself. Think PayPal (payment recipients must sign up), Calendly (meeting invitees become users), or Snyk (branded pull requests on GitHub). Product-led acquisition has zero marginal cost and is entirely within your control.

Featured guest perspectives

"Product-led acquisition, meaning the use of the product grows the product. For example, if I'm using PayPal and I'm sending $1,000 to somebody else, there is no way they will not create a PayPal account to accept the $1,000."

— Julian Shapiro    "Seventy percent of our signups come through that viral loop that you referred to. And then, of those signups, then they're usually solo users and then they start to invite team members in..."

— Annie Pearl        3 Prioritize earned channels over rented ones  Invest in channels you own: virality, word-of-mouth, user-generated content, and SEO. These create defensible growth engines that competitors cannot easily replicate. Rented channels like paid acquisition should supplement, not drive, your growth. Aim for 40-50% of new customers from organic channels.

Featured guest perspectives

"As a growth team, your number one priority is to create your own or your earned channel. Channel that you've earned and that nobody else can compete in but you... It really goes into the concept of product-led growth acquisition, which means you're relying on virality, on word of mouth, on user-generated content."

— Elena Verna    "A good metric is that 40 to 50% of your new customers should ideally come from organic channels and 50% from paid. If 90% come from paid, that means at some point that the music is going to stop."

— Gokul Rajaram        4 Layer loops to compound growth  The best growth engines combine multiple types of loops that feed each other. A viral loop can create content that fuels SEO. Celebrity partnerships drive media mentions that boost organic search. Don't rely on a single channel; introduce new loops every 18 months to find the next S-curve.

Featured guest perspectives

"I've always thought of LinkedIn as just such a great example of this where you have this viral loop... the byproduct is when people join, they create this beautiful lightning page, which is your profile that gets indexed. It's kind of like a viral loop feeding an SEO loop that continues to grow."

— Luc Levesque    "Really figuring out how do you build compounding growth loops where it's not just one way of acquiring people, but you're building two and three and four ways that layer onto each other that help you to really supercharge your engine of acquiring people."

— Bangaly Kaba        5 Measure incrementality, not attribution  Use holdouts and incrementality tests to understand the true causal impact of your growth investments. Monitor experiments long-term (12+ months) to distinguish between real growth and 'pull-forward' effects. Payback period is a better measure than LTV/CAC because it reflects compounding speed.

Featured guest perspectives

"What we really care about is incrementality... Incrementality test is basically don't show ads on meta for certain number of people. Show it to the other set, see what the lift is and the outcome."

— Archie Abrams    "The most basic example of this would be virality... Based on that coefficient, it has a lot to do with how fast your business grows... thinking about something like payback period is a much better measure of paid marketing performance than LTV to CAC because the speed at which you get enough money back to then go acquire another customer has much more bearing on how fast your business can grow."

— Dan Hockenmaier

✗ Common Mistakes

Over-relying on paid acquisition for consumer subscription productsApplying scalable growth tactics before finding product-market fitConfusing a flywheel that exists with one that is material enough to change economicsTesting new channels for too long (more than a quarter) without clear signal     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

A significant portion of new users come from the product itself (invites, shares, content)Your growth compounds over time rather than requiring linear investmentThe next customer is getting easier to acquire, not harderMultiple loops are feeding each other to create compounding effects

"We invested actually in some time to essentially add screenshot tracking... we were able to basically articulate and say, 'Okay, streak milestones is the obvious one.'... we staffed those moments with illustrators and animators and created these really delightful experiences around them, and that worked amazingly well."  Tactical:  Track where users take screenshots in your app to identify organic viral triggers.Invest in high-quality illustrations and animations for 'shareable' milestones like streaks or leaderboard wins.

"The exploring emerging channels framework that I'll take... has three core ingredients... understanding if there is an overlap between what the customers need is, what your company's goals are, and what the channel actually does really well."  Tactical:  Evaluate if the channel's medium (e.g., audio, video) matches your product's storytelling needsPrioritize channels where the 'strength of the medium' aligns with your growth goals    "I like to spend a lot of time thinking about how they monetize. What is the monetization strategy of the channel? And the reason is because if you, as a business, can match or support their monetization strategy, it actually gives you a really interesting leg up with that channel."  Tactical:  Research how a new platform plans to make money before testing itPosition your company as a 'case study' for the platform's emerging ad products    "Generally I wouldn't let anything bleed past a quarter. You can probably get some good signal in a month or less, what I would call fishing. It wouldn't be like you're just putting bait in the water to figure out where the fish are, not necessarily getting statistically significant repeatable solutions."  Tactical:  Use a one-month 'fishing' period to look for directional momentumAvoid spending more than one quarter on a new channel if it doesn't show repeatable potential

"Seventy percent of our signups come through that viral loop that you referred to. And then, of those signups, then they're usually solo users and then they start to invite team members in and then the team starts using Calendly and then usually the head of that team either inbounds to us or we have some sort of PQL data."  Tactical:  Optimize the experience for the 'recipient' of the service to drive viral adoption.Use PQL (Product Qualified Lead) data to identify when a solo user's team usage warrants a sales reach-out.

"We constantly will relook at an experiment a year later, see that the way the GMV curve for the distribution was different than we might've originally thought. And that'll actually change what we do from that previous experiment. And so there's a lot of longterm monitoring of experiments over these very long time horizons to both inform what those input metrics are and more importantly hold ourselves accountable to, did we actually move what we cared about, which is that longterm GMV, in the right way?"  Tactical:  Implement automated 'pings' to re-evaluate experiment results at 3, 6, 9, and 12-month intervals.Use long-term holdouts to distinguish between true incremental growth and 'pull-forward' effects.    "What we really care about is incrementality. So incrementality is kind of the gold standards... Incrementality test is basically don't show ads on meta for certain number of people. Show it to the other set, see what the lift is and the outcome."  Tactical:  Run 'ghost ad' or 'holdout' tests by withholding marketing spend from a control group to measure true lift.Prioritize incrementality measurement over attribution modeling when making budget allocation decisions.

"Being able to identify the various micro and macro loops, how they're all connected, being able to document them in a qualitative model to communicate a shared understanding of how you grow, it's really powerful."  Tactical:  Document micro and macro loops in a qualitative modelAugment qualitative models with quantitative data to guide quarterly focus    "Snyk, for example, believed very early that we could build out powerful content loops via fixed pull requests that we raise on GitHub. New users, they'll sign up for Snyk, they'll connect their GitHub accounts, Snyk will scan their code, will find vulnerabilities, will automatically create Snyk-branded pull requests to fix those vulnerabilities. Other devs in the repo will see and interact with those PRs, and some of them will follow links to Snyk, create accounts and some of them will connect their own repos, and so the loop continues."  Tactical:  Design loops that provide immediate value while exposing the product to new usersUse company-generated, company-distributed content loops to drive viral growth    "The best way I've found to articulate a growth strategy that fulfills the promise of usefully guiding the team's execution, it's the loop based model... Being able to identify the various micro and macro loops, how they're all connected, being able to document them in a qualitative model to communicate a shared understanding of how you grow. It's really powerful."  Tactical:  Identify and connect micro and macro loops to form a cohesive growth strategyUse data to identify which part of the loop is the current biggest constraint

"Pick the hardest side is my advice. And then, how some companies do this, again, I think there's a lot of different ways to do this, but a common advice is find a way to jumpstart one side. Find a way to hack one side, play one player mode is what it's also called sometimes, but try to find a way to tap into existing channels that have one side of your marketplace already latent."  Tactical:  Identify which side (supply or demand) is harder to acquire and focus growth efforts there.Tap into existing platforms (like Craigslist or Yellow Pages) to source the 'easier' side manually.    "What we did is leveraging this community and building essentially a soft onboarding supply engine where we would pay our best drivers $35 per mentor session... the mentors were our very best drivers, and they were evangelists for the brand. So, what they did was they would share personal tips on when and where to drive."  Tactical:  Identify top-performing users to act as mentors or ambassadors.Incentivize mentors to provide social proof and tactical advice that corporate marketing cannot replicate.    "We built a team of hundreds of account executives, and their job was just pick up the phone and call those drivers. And so, we had the same aha moment of like could we get some of our best drivers to do that for us... we called them recruiters. And so, as a recruiter, as a driver, you could just, if this was quiet on the road, you could just hop on your phone and you would have a mini sales dashboard where you could claim leads."  Tactical:  Create a 'sales dashboard' for power users to claim and convert dropped-off leads.Pay a bounty for successful activations to turn low-utilization time into productive growth work.

"The criteria I would think about is... one, the better signal is retention and depth of engagement... Number two is, there's some element of user quality and ability to monetize... The third thing to look at is... analyze what the value exchange is. What are they giving you to incentivize you to develop on their platform?"  Tactical:  Evaluate the 'value exchange' of a new platform (what distribution are they giving in exchange for your data/content?).Prioritize platforms where users have a higher propensity to pay (e.g., iOS vs. Android market share dynamics).

"The goal of your Kindle strategies, these like non-scalable hacks, they only exist to unlock the fire strategies, to unlock the things that could take you to millions of users."  Tactical:  Use 'Kindle' strategies (hacks) only to reach the point where 'Fire' strategies (scalable loops) can be ignitedHire full-time growth roles only after a scalable 'Fire' strategy has been identified    "If your plan is paid acquisition on top of freemium, I'd pivot right now."  Tactical:  Build social mechanicsModel retention economics

"At the highest level, it's like taking a go-to-market approach where your product job is to grow revenue and you use humans as a backstop and not the other way around."  Tactical:  Identify stages in the customer journey where humans are currently required and attempt to automate themUse humans as a 'backstop' for complex issues like security reviews or data migrations while keeping the core path self-service    "One of the principles that guides our thinking and our strategy is give value before you extract value... we intentionally put out a lot of free software. And the idea is that this software is not sort of gimmicky... if they're engaging with it deeply enough, they're going to run into the limits of what that value is."  Tactical:  Design free tools that solve a real problem for small users without immediate expirationSet usage limits or feature gates at the point where a user has already realized significant value

Crystal W 1 quote      "Step one, you have constraints. Similar to our sandbox example of everything in the world that's orange versus everything in a construction site, you have to think about the physics of the current market, the product, the model and the channels that you're using."  Tactical:  Identify underutilized levers within your existing model (e.g., using service providers as a sales force)Change only one small variable at a time to avoid disrupting the entire systemLeverage real-world physical presence (like branded uniforms) as a low-cost acquisition channel

"The most basic example of this would be virality. Your existing customers are referring new customers and those go on to refer new customers. Based on that coefficient, it has a lot to do with how fast your business grows. And similarly with paid marketing, as you generate contribution margin, you can reinvest that and grow and actually if you link those two up explicitly, it makes it really clear why thinking about something like payback period is a much better measure of paid marketing performance than LTV to CAC because the speed at which you get enough money back to then go acquire another customer has much more bearing on how fast your business can grow"  Tactical:  Link contribution margin generation directly to acquisition spend in your modelPrioritize payback period over LTV/CAC to understand growth velocity

"Growth is a game of inches... it's really about finding the aha moments, the opportunities. And sometimes opportunities are things that seem really silly... it's really taking the core engine and actually wrapping it around the user interface around the experience, around the flows so that people can get to it faster."  Tactical:  Maintain a high-volume list of growth hypotheses (e.g., 100 ideas) and sprint through themFocus on reducing friction in user flows to help customers reach the 'aha moment' faster

"And then we also figured out these viral motions around our referral program, and shared folders. And so Dropbox started expanding virally for the first several years... we applied that same engineering mentality to these viral loops."  Tactical:  Use referral programs and shared folders to drive organic expansion.Study epidemiology to understand how viruses spread as a parallel for consumer internet growth.

"I feel like only 30 to 40% of what I've learned in the last 15 to 20 years of being in growth transfers here because we just need to invest in such bigger bets, and innovate, and create new growth loops here, everybody and their mother is starting a vibe coding business nowadays, and we need to figure out how to be ahead of them."  Tactical:  Shift focus from 95% optimization to 95% innovation in growth strategies.Invest in 'bigger bets' that reinvent the solution rather than tweaking the current journey.    "The only way to create a word of mouth loop is just to blow their socks off."  Tactical:  Prioritize 'wow moments' over 'aha moments' to trigger immediate social sharing.    "This is product-led growth... to the max, supercharged. Yes, because you're literally using your product to drive that awareness by giving it away to the agents in your ecosystem that will do that distribution for you."  Tactical:  Identify 'agents' in the ecosystem (like hackathon organizers) and empower them with free product access to handle distribution.    "As a growth team, your number one priority is to create your own or your earned channel. Channel that you've earned and that nobody else can compete in but you... It really goes into the concept of product-led growth acquisition, which means you're relying on virality, on word of mouth, on user-generated content."  Tactical:  Invest in user-generated content (UGC) libraries, such as templates or case studies, to drive organic acquisition.Optimize both the 'sender' and 'recipient' experience in sharing loops to maximize viral coefficient.    "Not overlaying every single way that you can grow through product, through marketing and through sales as an evolution. Is a huge mistake that a lot of growth teams fail to iterate on and innovate on."  Tactical:  Introduce a new growth loop or channel every 18 months to diversify the growth engine.Allocate 20-25% of the growth team's annual time to exploring new, unproven growth loops.Allow new growth loops 6-18 months to show results before applying strict revenue expectations.    "Growth loops... action, reaction that generates another action and it's a self-contained flywheel they can spin."  Tactical:  Map out the 'action-reaction' cycle of your product to identify potential flywheels.

"Where product-led growth plays really interestingly, is in the land and expand phases of the market... product-led growth, which is really good at is expand because it prompts the user to get more involved. And that's classically a Main Street play."  Tactical:  Use PLG to drive 'expand' motions where the next purchase has low risk.Recognize that PLG often requires a sales team overlay to secure enterprise-level 'chasm' deals.

"There was a tipping point in April where the newsletter was growing... This was when Substack introduced recommendations, which has been a massive growth engine, and I guess being one of the top publications, I benefited from it."

Grant Lee 2 quotes

"All the initial influencers, I onboarded manually myself. I would jump on a call with each one of them so that they understood what Gamma represented, how to use the product. You want to be able to have them tell you story but in their voice. I think a lot of people think influencer marketing and they'll think these big trendy creators, people that have a million followers. This is the wrong approach. You basically give them a script to read, immediately feels like an ad. That product is not connected really to them in any way. You're much better doing the hard thing, which is hard to scale, finding the thousands of micro influencers that have an audience where your product maybe is actually useful."  Tactical:  Avoid large creators with generic scripts; focus on micro-influencers with high trust.Manually onboard early influencers to ensure they deeply understand the product's value.Target 'echo chambers' like specific professions (e.g., educators) where word-of-mouth spreads naturally.    "When you're early on, your mindset should almost be like you're trying to create a word of mouth machine. If you can get that part right, everything else becomes significantly easier. And if you have any, and I think this applies to both prosumer, B2C, as well as even B2B products, if you have a B2B product, even if you're not telling all of your friends, you should be telling colleagues where that product is relevant."  Tactical:  Monitor if a healthy chunk of leads comes from organic recommendations.Focus on removing friction in the 'create and share' loop to enable natural virality.

"We laugh whenever we hear somebody say they have a flywheel, which gives you the idea of network economies. There are often flywheels, the ones that really are material, are rare. The key thing here is materiality, not whether the flywheel exists, but whether the effect is strong enough to really tilt returns."  Tactical:  Measure the actual economic impact of your network effects to see if they are 'material' or just 'modest' improvements.

"I've seen a lot, and this is when I had to reset my thinking coming from a growth team joining YC, is you can't start a startup ethic with a growth team mindset because that is just scalable things all the time. And really what you need to go back to is doing things that don't scale and unscale your way of thinking about customers."  Tactical:  Avoid applying 'growth team' tactics (optimization, loops) before finding product-market fit through manual effort

"We call our internal strategy called B2C2B. All those consumers, personal user use Notion for the most simple way you can use a computer or your phone, which is note-taking or document-sharing. And then they realize, 'Oh, Notion can do more of that.'... Then they bring Notion to work. Half our B2B customers coming from prior personal users."  Tactical:  Identify a 'top of funnel' use case with over 1 billion potential users (e.g., notes, calendar, email).Ensure the transition from personal use to team use is seamless as the user discovers more complex features.

"Product-led acquisition, meaning the use of the product grows the product. For example, if I'm using PayPal and I'm sending $1,000 to somebody else, there is no way they will not create a PayPal account to accept the $1,000. By me trying to use PayPal in its everyday intention and me getting value out of it to settle a debt, I'm automatically enticing someone else, very strongly so, to also become a PayPal customer."  Tactical:  Identify if the product can facilitate 'settling debts' (money, NFTs, etc.) where the recipient must join to claim valueIntroduce chat or social features that require inviting others to partake in a conversationUse 'billboarding' by placing branding on the product's output (e.g., 'Sent via Hotmail' or 'Powered by Calendly')    "If you have a marketplace like eBay or some marketplace for selling collectible shoes or something where you're encouraging users to create beautiful content of the items being sold, like these cool landing pages that show off the products, and they share it elsewhere, then that's an example of users making content they're sharing off platform that is useful for their own followers."  Tactical:  Ask if users use the product to make content in any formMake the sharing pages as appealing and easy to consume as possibleEncourage public conversations (like Quora or Reddit) to increase SEO surface area

How you drive people to D2C, how you acquire customers, how you build sustainable businesses, that needs to change."  Tactical:  Prioritize content and community over commerce to drive organic acquisition.Avoid the 'drug' of paid marketing by building long-term SEO and thought leadership.

"The first step is join, the second is evaluate, the third is upgrade, and the fourth is expand. This funnel represents the journey of a customer in a PLG product as they advance and develop in their lifetime of using the product... expansion drives net dollar retention, it drives brand awareness, it drives more usage in more pockets of the company, it is awesome for renewal rates if you're working with enterprise contracts, and ultimately then also brings new referrals into the product that loop all the way back to the beginning at join."  Tactical:  Map the growth strategy across the four stages: Join, Evaluate, Upgrade, and ExpandFocus on expansion within existing accounts to drive net dollar retention and referralsIdentify specific product triggers that move users from the 'Evaluate' stage to 'Upgrade'

"The right growth advisor can have literally company changing impact where they're either building or helping to ideate or helping to implement a growth loop that literally changes the company. As we know, you need a great product and you need a great growth loop. And it's usually just one loop that you need to get right."  Tactical:  Focus on identifying and dominating one primary growth channel rather than diversifying too earlyLook for advisors who have deep experience in the specific loop (SEO, Viral, Paid) relevant to your product    "I've always thought of LinkedIn as just such a great example of this where you have this viral loop where if you recall when it was just starting, everybody was getting these invites from LinkedIn... the byproduct is when people join, they create this beautiful lightning page, which is your profile that gets indexed. It's kind of like a viral loop feeding an SEO loop that continues to grow."  Tactical:  Design product flows where user acquisition naturally creates indexable contentLook for ways to make the byproduct of one loop (e.g., registration) the fuel for another (e.g., SEO pages)

"The signal is that is a good motion for you is if the product is really intuitive to onboard onto. There's a low learning curve so you don't need a human to onboard the user. Also, if there's a viral component to it, that is really what can take."  Tactical:  Evaluate if the product can be onboarded without a salespersonIdentify viral triggers within the core product workflowMonitor for 'bottom-up' adoption signals from enterprise users in self-serve data

"It's a lot easier to get someone to send more invites than it is to get someone who's a little shy to even send one. So I thought it was much easier to get those people to share the product with bigger groups of folks than it would be to get someone who's just not like that."  Tactical:  Identify and target the 'connector' persona within your user base to drive referrals.    "You need to have invites early and often so that you catch people who want to share it, are social people. And then for the people who would never participate in that, they can ignore it or skip it. But that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be all over the entire product."  Tactical:  Place invite screens early in the onboarding flow, even if some users find it premature.Make invites optional but ubiquitous throughout the product.

"With certainty, if you're good at your job, you can make an app grow and go viral. Over the years of building all these apps, I've accrued all these growth hacks that still nobody knows about."  Tactical:  Develop a library of growth hacks based on platform-specific mechanisms    "We found that as a user got older from age 13 to 18, the number of people that they invite to an app just declines almost exponentially."  Tactical:  Target users aged 13-18 if you want to achieve organic network effects without ad spend    "To be convinced to download an app, you need to see it... three times or so. So you basically need to saturate an area with every kind of marketing you can."  Tactical:  Saturate a specific geographic area or community with multiple marketing touchpoints simultaneouslyUse targeted ads and social media follows to create an illusion of ubiquity    "I have a whole laundry list of iOS mechanisms that people use for a certain way today, but you could invert them... Contact sync is a great example because you sync your contacts and then it finds all the friends and then ranks the people who are not on the app yet but have a bunch of friends on it."  Tactical:  Use contact sync to identify and rank non-users with the highest number of existing connections on the platform

"Virality is really when the word of mouth of a product is high quality... It's when customers market your product. And that is incredibly powerful, but also that's incredibly actionable."  Tactical:  Build a great product that solves a sharp problem as the bedrock before applying viral tactics.Distinguish between 'synthetic virality' (referral loops) and 'bedrock virality' (word of mouth driven by workflow compression).    "Network effects is when you create value for passive members by other people joining the network... Network effects is a feature by itself, and it's the most powerful feature."  Tactical:  Identify if your product creates value for existing users when new users join (e.g., file formats, communication networks).Understand that a network effect business can survive even if the revenue model is under attack, as long as the activity spiral remains.

"The choice you're facing is, how do I take advantage of having that one side scaled to attract the other side? ... Uber... would just hand out coupons for free rides at events, parties, things like that, to take people home. And that was a way of saying, 'Hey, we're subsidizing the drivers in the city. That's our scaled side. Now we're going to use that subsidized driver base to attract riders.'"  Tactical:  Identify which side of the market is easier to scale first and use it as a 'subsidy' to attract the harder-to-get side.

Tactical:  Focus on creating a product that people spontaneously tell others about.Recognize that most viral features have a decay rate and won't sustain growth alone.

"The biggest thing that you can do is a network effect. The more I pin something on Pinterest, the better the experience for every user on Pinterest. Every time I add a pin to a board, I'm creating a new edge in Pinterest Graph, that Pinterest then uses to create recommendations and enrich their understanding of all those objects on Pinterest."  Tactical:  Convert user 'kinetic energy' (clicks/taps) into data that improves the experience for the whole network    "How do you get it so that, as your users use the product, they want to share it with other people? They create metadata that you can then use for SEO. You have collaborative experiences that pull other people in. There's all different things you can do here. And then, there's also things that you can do to re-engage a user."  Tactical:  Build features where users naturally invite others into a collaborative experienceUse automated notifications triggered by one user's action to pull another user back in    "I think every marketplace has to figure out what I call tipping loops. And there's two types of tipping loops that work together symbiotically to help a marketplace scale. The first are the growth loops."  Tactical:  Identify 'seller-to-buyer' loops where suppliers invite their own customers to the platformIncentivize referrals to turn existing participants into acquisition channels

"A referral program where we have incentives on both sides is the best way to go. ... it's a great accelerant when it's already working, but it can't fix it if people don't want to talk about your product."  Tactical:  Implement double-sided incentives (rewarding both the referrer and the referee).Only invest heavily in referral programs once you have a baseline of organic word-of-mouth.

"If you don't build the network effect into what you are making, you are almost certainly going to fail... The question is, will this work better for my users if they tell other people about it? And if the answer is no, then why would they tell other people about it?"  Tactical:  Evaluate if the product's utility increases as the user's network joins.Design features that incentivize word-of-mouth by making the user's life better when they share.

"The Black Loop is someone comes in, they make a doc, they share with a group of people, some subset of the people turn around and make another doc, and the process repeats itself over and over again. The blue loop is someone comes in, makes a doc, and instead of sharing it with a team or with the collaborators, they publish it to the world."  Tactical:  Identify if your product has a 'collaboration' loop versus a 'publishing' loop.Design loops that allow users to solve problems and then share those solutions to attract new users.

"Growth organizations are in this interesting space, they're in between everybody else. They're in everybody else's sandpit in a little bit, in a little way, and they're kind of at the edge of everybody's full-time job and they are very valuable, but they can be complicated because of all those relationships."  Tactical:  Focus on the 'connective tissue' between departments to find growth opportunities that traditional silos miss.    "For really sophisticated companies, the people who really nail this, it's about making both motions work together. If you can get a PLG motion work to feed your sales team and a sales team motion work to feed your PLG funnel when the sales leads aren't ready yet and you can get those motions into playing with each other, you can make a lot of money."  Tactical:  Design loops where self-serve users become leads for sales, and sales-rejected leads are nurtured back into self-serve funnels.

"We have a growth agent... LinkedIn has a very unique... we've kind of funneled all of our unique loops, our funnels, our tests of the past, everything into this growth agent, and now you can basically rock your respect for it, your idea for it.

"on the seller side... it costs 20 cents to list an item... we really leaned into that as the currency for the seller referral program... If I refer them, they'll get some listing credits. It'll be easier for them to open their shop. And then when I need to list more items, I also have credits that I can apply."  Tactical:  Identify a low-cost, high-value internal 'currency' to use for referrals.Target referral programs at specific communities where word-of-mouth is already happening.

"Word-of-mouth you can only have if you have high frequency of use... If you're using Waze every day, then every day you have an opportunity to tell someone else. So word-of-mouth, even though that everyone would like that, it's only going to happen if you have high frequency of use."  Tactical:  Focus on high frequency of use to trigger organic word-of-mouth.If frequency is low, rely on 'coolness' or unique experiences to drive referrals.

"If you have really healthy LTVs... then there is a big opportunity to play paid and lean into paid growth loops and paid acquisition loops."  Tactical:  Calculate if single-player LTVs are high enough (e.g., hundreds of dollars) to support paid loops.    "The first thing you look for is that, is there inherent product network effects? It's something that it's either there, or isn't from inception from my experience. I think it's very difficult to manufacture. You'd only study when... It's very hard to manufacture product network effects if they aren't there from the get go."  Tactical:  Identify if utility increases for existing users as new users join (e.g., marketplaces or collaboration tools) before trying to build viral loops.    "I think that surprising thing to people probably is that it's also the case with some later stage companies. It's not just early stage companies that are kind of one trick pulleys. Sometimes it's later stage companies as well."  Tactical:  Identify the primary growth engine and maximize it before diversifying too early.Monitor the risk of over-reliance on a single channel (e.g., Google algorithm updates or Meta ad costs).    "I actually have to talk them out, focusing on diversification too early. Contrast that with some later stage companies for who are... At scale, I know 50 plus million ARR, 90 plus percent reliant on a single acquisition channel, which just mire with risk and diversification is a blind spot for them."  Tactical:  For early-stage: Put all energy into the one tactic accounting for 80%+ of acquisition.For late-stage: Carve out resources to explore new channels once the primary engine is at scale.

"PLG motion is perfect for lowering the barrier for more people to try, broader the reach. It's a kind of volume kind of game. And then the sales motion, you can have very targeted list of big customers you go after, you close them and it's a big order."  Tactical:  Use PLG to lower barriers to entry and broaden reachCombine PLG with a sales motion for high-value enterprise targets    "The biggest difference from SLG and PLG is that the sales funnel traditionally work like something... Product-led funnel is different. It's much more similar to B2C. Basically you can still have people visit your website and they sign up for free version or free account or free trial. The most important thing, the biggest difference, is now you want them to use the product."  Tactical:  Focus on product usage as the leading indicator for successAllow users to access the product before signing a contract    "A product-led acquisition is a great place to invest, if you have a collaboration workflow, you have some inherent, internal viral components in your products. Think about Figma, think about Calendarly even, right? It can spread. This product is so easy. You can build something to allow it to spread on its own."  Tactical:  Identify internal viral components in collaborative productsBuild features that allow the product to spread through user invitations

"PLG makes sense for a lot of companies at the outset... The thing that folks get wrong is it does typically have a ceiling. So people are generally not going to give you $1 million via self-serve flow. So at some point if you want to sustain growth rates, you're going to have to have your deal sizes get bigger and bigger."  Tactical:  Layer in sales before the PLG ceiling hits to maintain growth rates.
