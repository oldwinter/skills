Community Building  Community building creates a defensible moat that competitors cannot easily replicate. A strong community turns customers into advocates, provides continuous product feedback, and generates organic growth—but only if you invest in genuine connection rather than treating members as a marketing channel.

Read Guide

The Guide  4 key steps synthesized from 18 experts.

1 Start with super-users who genuinely love your product  Don't try to build a community of everyone. Start with your most passionate users—the ones who would be devastated if your product disappeared. These early members set the culture and attract others like them. A small, engaged community beats a large, passive one.

Featured guest perspectives

"The first hundred customers... you want people who are going to love you... Find the people who you can delight, not just satisfy."

— Kevin Hale    "We started with creators who were already obsessed with the product... they became our first community evangelists because they genuinely believed in what we were building."

— Aarthi Ramamurthy        2 Give members a reason to connect with each other, not just with you  The strongest communities create horizontal connections between members, not just vertical connections to the brand. Facilitate introductions, create spaces for members to help each other, and celebrate member contributions. You know it's working when conversations happen without you.

Featured guest perspectives

"The best communities create connections between members... you want people forming relationships with each other, not just with your brand."

— David Spinks    "The magic happens when members start helping each other without being asked... that's when community becomes self-sustaining."

— Lenny Rachitsky        3 Create rituals and shared experiences  Strong communities have recurring rituals that members anticipate—weekly AMAs, monthly challenges, annual events. These predictable touchpoints create belonging and give people reasons to return. The ritual itself often matters more than the content.

Featured guest perspectives

"Having regular events creates a heartbeat for the community... people start planning around them and feeling like they're part of something ongoing."

— Suhail Doshi    "Every great community has rituals... it's what separates a community from just a group of people who happen to use the same product."

— Greg Isenberg        4 Empower community leaders and give them status  You cannot scale community alone. Identify and elevate members who naturally emerge as helpers and connectors. Give them special access, recognition, and tools to amplify their contributions. Your job shifts from community builder to community enabler.

Featured guest perspectives

"The most successful communities identify and empower 'hosts'... people who naturally want to bring others together and help them succeed."

— Gina Bianchini    "Community doesn't scale through you—it scales through empowering members to become leaders themselves."

— David Spinks

✗ Common Mistakes

Treating community as a marketing channel instead of a genuine value exchangeTrying to scale too fast before establishing culture and ritualsMaking it all about the brand instead of facilitating member-to-member connectionsAbandoning community during slow periods instead of investing through the dip     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Members form relationships with each other, not just with youConversations happen organically without staff promptingCommunity leaders emerge naturally and want to contribute moreNew members are welcomed and onboarded by existing members

"I created a secret group that I called Navel Gazers... you set the norms very explicitly and say, 'This is a collaborative debate environment. This is only yes, and.'... This sounds by the way very non-rigorous... It turns out there's limited amounts of time and so people will choose to build on the things they find most interesting."  Tactical:  Start with a small 'seed crystal' of highly engaged people to establish norms before scaling.Use 'I wonder' statements to offer critiques without triggering defensive reactions.Actively facilitate by encouraging people to share their ideas in the group and providing positive reinforcement (emojis, notes).

"it's when your community helps you achieve such ubiquity and such name recognition that it actually allows you to start moving upmarket into the enterprise. And I know that might be very specific to enterprise oriented companies, but that's how we defined it at Notion was the fact that so many people were talking about this, sharing what they had built about it, honestly starting businesses of their own around it to formalize the relationship with teams that I think it de-risked Notion as a choice for a lot of companies"  Tactical:  Focus on achieving ubiquity to move upmarketEncourage users to build their own businesses or formalize relationships around your product    "I think that community lends itself particularly well if you have something that your product creates that people want to share because it exhibits something about themselves. So at Notion it was templates or even people just creating their own workspaces and being really excited to show them off. So Notion really benefited from being a creative product, but the same is true of Figma or Canva or any of these where showing people what it is that you've created is an aspirational thing to do."  Tactical:  Identify the 'atomic unit of sharing' in your productEnable users to show off their creations to signal expertise or organization    "I would really urge people to sit down and really think carefully what is going to be more conducive to our long-term success? Is it going to be that ubiquity or is it going to be revenue now? And I think if we look at a lot of the companies that have been just wildly successful from the start, they're people who have pushed off maybe monetizing every little thing if it's going to really put a damper on that type of enthusiasm and momentum"  Tactical:  Evaluate if organic word-of-mouth is more valuable than short-term revenueAvoid over-monetizing early if it dampens community enthusiasm    "I would recommend highly not necessarily coming in with preconceived notions about what a community needs to look like. ... I think that some communities get built where people are like, okay, well we have this community and it's going to be this and this and this... As opposed to I think a lot of listening of the people who are actually participating."  Tactical:  Conduct one-on-one or small group Zoom calls with early members to ask why they are thereFollow the lead of the community rather than forcing a specific format    "The initial base of the ambassadors program which started back in 2019 was just 20 people and they were the 20 people who we happened to see be the most vocal already across Twitter and a couple of other social media platforms because they had that shared quality of wanting to be really vocal and expressive about their experience with the product."  Tactical:  Identify the most vocal users on social media for your initial cohortStart with a small, manageable group (e.g., 20 people) to build core relationships    "not trying to hit a number early on. So don't dilute the impact of what it is that you're trying to do in order to show growth. I think that that's very important to protect yourself early on. So making sure that you are learning what individuals really want out of this and making them feel like they're very seen and very heard."  Tactical:  Prioritize making individual members feel seen and heard over total member countShare community wins and stories internally to inspire the company    "not growing it so big so fast. One thing that we actually thought about pretty carefully was what a rate of healthy growth would be. So there actually is an application process for joining the ambassadors. ... I think it's because you don't really have a sense of who else is there with you. So helping to defray those concerns I think is a good course of action."  Tactical:  Implement a light application process to manage the intake of new membersInduct new members in small monthly cohorts to allow for proper welcoming

"Dylan really identified immediately that Twitter was the place where that existed... he built this tool or this scraper where he identified a couple influencers in the design community... he figured out who followed them and who followed those people and also the influence that these people had over other people, and made this massive node graph."  Tactical:  Go to where the community already is rather than trying to force them to a new platformMap the social graph of influencers to identify key nodes for feedback and outreach    "The first person I hired was actually a designer advocate... that designer advocacy positions actually scaled with Figma, and we still have it today. It's extreme. I think it's the magic dust, we call it, that we sprinkle on go-to-market to make a lot of our go-to-market function work."  Tactical:  Hire advocates from within the existing user base who are passionate about the toolEmbed advocates in marketing, sales, and product feedback loops

Crystal W 1 quote      "we almost create this artificial friction to help differentiate how deeply a user wants something or needs something. And if the user doesn't fill out that questionnaire, maybe they're actually looking for something else."  Tactical:  Use 'hand-raiser' approaches to identify specific user needsLeave 'breadcrumbs' in the app to track how deeply a user wants to engage with a community

"Community. I think community is really important here because you need to bring people together as they're exploring these capabilities... Community also amplifies that word of mouth. It amplifies all of the social posting."  Tactical:  Launch a Discord community early to allow users to share what they've built and help each other.Create an ambassador program to empower the most active community members.    "At Nero, we were first trying to stand up community... I went and I started talking to a bunch of people that have done communities... She's like, 'Well, are you talking about a user community or an agency community or a partner community?'... She would applying it to me in a structural way for me to grasp my head around it and then implement something that had much better results."  Tactical:  Consider starting with agency or partner communities if you need to show traction within a short timeframe (e.g., 12 months).Seek structural advice from community experts to avoid treating community building as a slow 'find PMF' process.

Janna Bastow 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Honestly, it wasn't so much that we set out to build a community, it was that we got together with some product people with the idea that we didn't know what we were doing. And so we figured if we got together with some other product people and started chatting it through, we'd all learn together. And so it was just the sense of sharing and collaborating and learning from each other and just keeping it as grassroots as possible as it grew."  Tactical:  Maintain consistency by holding events at regular intervals (e.g., monthly meetups, annual conferences)Empower community members to curate content and find speakers to expand the network beyond the founders' reach

"We have a dbt Slack community of 50,000 and all of our employees are in that Slack channel regularly and can feel when we mess up or we don't quite deliver an experience that we're proud of, you will just see dozens of people trying to jump on board and try to make it better."  Tactical:  Ensure employees are active in the community Slack to maintain a tight feedback loop.Hire from the community to ensure employees have a natural ownership of the product experience.

"Airbnb is nothing without its hosts, nothing. If anything, Airbnb's product was its hosts. So there was a moment... where that narrative was building up more and more and we realized that there was a need to have a central team, which we called Hospitality, dedicated to equipping and recognizing and holding this product of our hosts accountable to their job."  Tactical:  Create a central team dedicated to equipping and recognizing your community members.Hold community members accountable to their role as the 'product' of the company.

"If there's something unique I have for your audience, I would say it's don't just build a product, build a movement. And to the extent that we've been successful, I think it's that we give people something to believe in, a philosophy, a worldview."  Tactical:  Define a clear worldview or philosophy that users can align withShift focus from building features to building a 'movement'    "So, those sorts of things bring a little art and soul and some fun into it as well. It doesn't have to be serious all the time. I think they can give something to believe in and work on and aim towards that's more than just a paycheck or more than just the utility, the base utility of the software."  Tactical:  Incorporate non-utilitarian elements (art, naming conventions, rituals) to give the community 'soul'Create opportunities for community members to contribute beyond just code (e.g., events, documentation, support)

Meltem Kuran 2 quotes

"Those cheaper channels are often places where people are just trying to get an answer to their question. So whether that be search engine optimization through the articles that you write for people, looking onto Reddit where people are asking these questions in communities, forming partnerships with other groups that are trying to answer these questions, existing communities where other business leaders are connecting with each other and looking at their peers to find answers to shared problems that they're having, or places like Quora."  Tactical:  Identify communities (Reddit, Quora, Slack) where your target audience asks specific questions.Set up keyword alerts to track relevant conversations in real-time.    "The value-add way would be explaining what the solution to that problem is. Because the reality is there are a lot of people out there who can probably solve this, and then providing your solution, but answer their question first, and then let them decide if they want to come with you or go with someone else. But the whole point of someone asking a question isn't to be sold a solution. It's like, 'I just need an answer.' So genuinely treat this person like a friend of yours, answer their question."  Tactical:  Answer the user's question completely before mentioning your product.Avoid automated responses; use real team members to build trust.

Petra Wille 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"A product community of practice could be a big part of that. So that is one impact. Then the other impact, there's less people development on the desk of the product lead if there is a good product community of practice. So product leads, your life will get so much easier if there is a product community of practice. And it's actually a pretty cheap way of doing people development because trainings are expensive, conference tickets are expensive, getting external product coach, expensive. But helping people to learn from each other by making room for that and giving them a bit of time to reflect and to share what they're learning, that's rather cheap."  Tactical:  Create dedicated time for team members to share reflections and learningsUse a 'community canvas' to define purpose, values, and success metricsDistribute community leadership roles to ensure sustainability

"Find the niche, start really small and find the niche... don't start to build this super scaled community. Start with few people who are passionate about a particular problem and want to get together kind of thing."  Tactical:  Identify a specific, narrow problem or interest to anchor the initial community.Think about monetization early so it becomes a 'weapon' rather than a 'crutch' later.    "I like to think of things like a dinner party or church... as the host, you have to curate the original set of people and you need a mix... you need a mix of different kinds of energy and that's almost an alchemy."  Tactical:  Explicitly define the 'rules of the party' (e.g., formal vs. casual).Actively facilitate introductions to make new members feel comfortable.Establish rituals (like a recurring weekly meeting) to build intimacy.

Tactical:  Create mentorship networks to match experienced leaders with those new to the roleProvide industry-specific frameworks (like PRDs for newsrooms) to lower the barrier to entry

"there's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing... that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it equips your customers or user base with that, then I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion. So it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working."  Tactical:  Identify and empower 'champions' within organizationsCreate local chapters (e.g., 'Friends of Figma') to foster human connections between usersLean into 'narrative tension' or controversial product stances to build a loyal following

"I constructed this list of, 'Here are the most central designers in the graph', but also then I looked at their work. And the ones that I was really inspired by as a total fanboy, and someone who wanted to learn as much as I could about design, was inspired by these folks, the ones I was inspired by I reached out to and said, 'Hey, can I buy you a coffee?'"  Tactical:  Use social network analysis to identify influential figures in your target communityReach out to community 'heroes' for feedback rather than just promotion

"I actually joined them on their community team. So I worked as a forums moderator, and then as a seller education specialist. Yeah. Spent a couple years doing that. And then through that process became sort of one of the internal voices that had a really good understanding of how their customer, one of their core customers, their sellers, were actually using their product."  Tactical:  Use community moderation to identify core customer pain pointsLeverage internal 'voice of the customer' status to transition into product roles    "Etsy was out there building in public... because they had such a passionate, involved, engaged early community that they could not just ship things and have them land well if they did not involve their community early. So they were doing prototyping, beta testing, and basically getting people to try things and give feedback on things."  Tactical:  Involve the community in early prototyping and beta testingUse community feedback to evangelize the product and teach others how to use it

"I think the other accelerant in all of this is the templates that we have, in particular the role that Miroverse plays in all of this... It actually got indexed by Google... that was another sort of acquisition channel top of funnel that actually drew a lot of users to it."  Tactical:  Enable users to publish their own workflows as public templates to drive organic search traffic.Leverage community-created content to solve niche use cases that the core product team hasn't addressed.
