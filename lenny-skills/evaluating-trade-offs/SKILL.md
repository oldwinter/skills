Evaluating Trade-offs  Evaluating trade-offs is the discipline of making clear, explicit decisions about what you will and won't do. It matters because product leadership is fundamentally about choosing which valuable things to sacrifice—every 'yes' is an implicit 'no' to something else, and muddled trade-offs lead to products that try to be everything and end up being nothing.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 40 experts.

1 Define what you're optimizing for  Before any trade-off conversation, explicitly state the optimization target. What are you optimizing for today, this quarter, this year? This single question cuts through circular debates and filters out low-priority considerations. Without alignment on the optimization function, you'll have endless tactical arguments rooted in misaligned principles.

Featured guest perspectives

"I always ask, 'What are you optimizing for?' That's the question, it's what are you optimizing for? And it's the short, medium, long-term in product, but it's what are you optimizing for today, this quarter, this year?"

— Nikita Miller    "There's no free lunch. You don't get something for free. You have to give up something. Then what do you give up? It's essentially you give up the right thing that market or your user wants at that given space and time. It's just the craft of building a business or building a product."

— Ivan Zhao        2 Present clear choices, not open-ended problems  When working with leadership, avoid presenting vague dilemmas. Instead, present a menu of options with explicit trade-offs. 'Here's what we're doing and here's what we're not doing and why—which would you pick?' This forces decisions and prevents the 'do everything' trap that spreads teams too thin.

Featured guest perspectives

"Be very clear with the tradeoffs that you need to make and present those tradeoffs back to your leadership team. So here's what we're doing and here's what we're not doing and why and which one would you pick? Give them a menu of items."

— Geoff Charles    "Oftentimes we'll use a traffic light. That means that the three options are three rows. The columns in the table will be criteria by which to evaluate the options... And then obviously it should be color-coded, red, yellow, green based on how it stacks up against those criteria."

— Naomi Gleit        3 Quantify both sides of the equation  Transform fuzzy trade-offs into quantifiable decisions by measuring the cost of both options. Assign dollar values to negative actions (churn, unsubscribes) and compare them against the revenue from the positive action. Use a 'common currency' like lifetime value or gross order value to make apples-to-apples comparisons across different business levers.

Featured guest perspectives

"What's that cost? Well, when they unsubscribe, we can't mail them. So we did some data science study on the side and we said, 'What is the value that we're losing from an unsubscribe?' And we came up with a number, it was a few dollars. But the point was, now we have this countervailing metric."

— Ronny Kohavi    "We spend a lot of time quantifying things in terms of a common currency... if we have, say, a dollar to spend, we know what we get depending on where we put it, over what timeframe."

— Jess Lachs        4 Ignore sunk costs—ask if you'd start today  The most dangerous bias in trade-off evaluation is sunk cost. Ask yourself: 'If I weren't already in this project, would I start it today with what I know now?' If the answer is no, continuing is the actual waste—not the resources already spent. Use the 'kill criteria' mentality to evaluate whether to persist or pivot.

Featured guest perspectives

"Waste is a prospective problem, not a retrospective one... if you wouldn't start this today, then that means that everything that you're putting into this going forward is the actual waste."

— Annie Duke    "I would look at how many more ideas the founder has on how to make it grow. If it's not going well and you're out of ideas, that is usually a good time to pivot. But when you have half a dozen or a dozen really good growth ideas that you haven't tried yet, try them."

— Dalton Caldwell        5 Think in time horizons and systems  Evaluate trade-offs across multiple time horizons using models like the three-horizon framework (70/20/10 split). Consider not just immediate impact but second-order effects on the entire system—who wins, who loses, and whether the winners provide more net value. Some features feel warm now but create long-term regret.

Featured guest perspectives

"It's like 70/20/10 across horizon one, two, and three. Horizon one business... generally there's about a 70% allocation... Horizon two, which is an adjacent thing... usually that tends to be around 20%... Then there's horizon three, which is three years out... and that's about 10%."

— Varun Parmar    "The saying is that's like peeing in your pants in cold weather. It feels really warm and nice to begin with. And then after a while, you start to regret it. It's about being short term, basically."

— Gustav Soderström    "Marketplaces are a little bit like a game of whac-a-mole... Many of the changes that are most consequential create winners and losers. And rolling with those changes is about recognizing whether the winners you've created are more important to your business than the losers you've created in the process."

— Ramesh Johari        6 Bias toward the harder path when learning matters  When two options are available and the outcome is uncertain, consider the 'learning ROI.' The easy path teaches you nothing if it fails. The hard path builds capability and attracts talent regardless of outcome. Everything you want is on the other side of 'worse first'—meaningful progress requires accepting short-term discomfort.

Featured guest perspectives

"If you have a choice and you choose the easy thing and it works great. If you choose the hard thing and it works great, you did more work, but if it doesn't work and you chose the easy thing, you've actually not learned anything... But if you do the hard path and it doesn't work, actually you still win because you've now done something hard."

— Farhan Thawar    "Everything you want is on the other side of worse first... If I'm optimizing for tomorrow and I just want to have a great day tomorrow, I'm going to stay exactly where I am... So if you realize this and instead ask the question, the version of myself five years from now, what would they wish I was going to do right now?"

— Graham Weaver

✗ Common Mistakes

Building features just because an engineer is 'free'—every new feature commits you to future maintenanceUsing data when it favors you and anecdotes when it favors you—be honest about what's actually workingSpending more time analyzing a decision than the decision is actually worth (the analysis cost exceeds the upside)Solving every problem with your primary skillset rather than considering approaches from other disciplines     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

You can articulate what you're NOT doing as clearly as what you are doingYour team uses 'tenets' to resolve recurring debates rather than re-litigating them every timeYou have a shared vocabulary for trade-off discussions (common currency, traffic light matrices)You can trace major product decisions back to an explicit optimization target

"Trying to ignore it by trying to pin it down with fake numbers that you just made up for yourself at great expense is a really bad idea... It doesn't really matter if it's 1,000 or 1,001, who cares? It orders a magnitude larger than the alternative, and so it is better."  Tactical:  Avoid over-analyzing minor numerical differences in long-term forecasts.Prioritize directions that offer significantly higher potential returns (orders of magnitude) over those that are merely slightly better.

"In my opinion, when you have to make a choice, think more and ship better. Most experiments should be thought experiments. They should not even be tried out because they're obviously going to fail which is contrary to, 'Let's try it out, and then let's see.' I think that wastes a lot of company time."  Tactical:  Use 'metathinking' to predict experiment failure and save company resources.When forced to choose between shipping fast and shipping better, choose excellence to ensure the product is noteworthy.

"Waste is a prospective problem, not a retrospective one... if you wouldn't start this today, then that means that everything that you're putting into this going forward is the actual waste."  Tactical:  Ask: 'If I weren't already in this project/relationship/job, would I start it today?'Recognize that continuing a failing path is the true waste of future resources.

Bob Baxley 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Tenets are really decision-making tools and it's sort of like... A classic one is paper versus plastic. It's just too complicated to reconsider that every time you're at the grocery store. So you sort of make a rule for yourself and you're just a paper person or a plastic person, you move on from there."  Tactical:  Identify debates the team has repeatedly and create a tenet to decide the direction once and for all.Ensure tenets are specific enough that someone could reasonably argue for the opposite (unlike platitudes like 'be simple').

"If you're a great engineer, the answer to almost every problem in your business is engineering... you probably by default should question it."  Tactical:  Question solutions that fall too comfortably within your own area of expertise

Dan Hockenmaier 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"But then you have all these teams that are really managing some tension in the business, which is totally different than a funnel. So say if you have a marketplace quality team... if I let on a bunch of new supply to a marketplace, probably the first thing that happens is our GMV or our revenue goes up... but if those are on average lower quality, it's going to degrade the kind of customer experience and reduce retention over time. And so the model that they're trying to build is how to manage that tension."  Tactical:  Build 'tension models' for teams like Quality or Risk to find the optimization point between growth and long-term health

Dalton Caldwell 1 quote

"I would look at how many more ideas the founder has on how to make it grow. If it's not going well and you're out of ideas, that is usually a good time to pivot. But when you have half a dozen or a dozen really good growth ideas that you haven't tried yet, try them. Right? Hey, give it a shot."  Tactical:  Pivot when you have run out of credible ideas to drive growthStay the course if you still have 'gas in the tank' in the form of untested, zany growth ideas

Drew Houston 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Andy cautions in the book that, 'Look, most of the time CEOs want options. They want to hedge their bets, but what you really want to do in these strategic inflection points is go all in one thing.' ... I just killed Carousel, killed Mailbox. Went all-in on productivity."  Tactical:  Identify where the majority of paying customers are (e.g., work vs. personal) to determine the core focus.Be willing to shut down secondary products to consolidate resources on the primary mission.

Donna Lichaw 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Run it through three filters... head, heart, hands is what I like to think of, which is head, okay, how's this going? What are my thoughts? ... Emotionally, how is this going in your heart? ... But then how does it feel in your body? Our bodies are ultimately where we take in our stimuli and then store all of our experiences."  Tactical:  Scan your physical reactions (e.g., tension, temperature) during or after an experiment to identify true feelings that logic might be masking.

"It should really be this thoughtful strategic decision-making process of how much will this cost me all in and is this the right use of funds... if you took that exact same million dollars and put it into brand ads, or they put it into influencer campaigns... would you make that million dollars or $1,000,001 back faster?"  Tactical:  Calculate the 'all-in' cost of SEO including PMs, engineers, CMS, and contentCompare SEO ROI against paid marketing or brand ads to see which drives revenue faster    "Instead of spending $15,000 on SEO, you can get... you can go to all these shows for the exact same budget, and you get users who are interested, they're in market, they try your tool out at the booth, and then they leave and they're leads that you could follow up with."  Tactical:  Analyze where your current paying customers actually come from before defaulting to SEOConsider if high-friction B2B products are better served by sales-led motions than search-led motions

So here's what we're doing and here's what we're not doing and why and which one would you pick? Give them a menu of items."  Tactical:  Communicate what the team is *not* doing as clearly as what they are doing.Present a 'menu' of options to executives to force a decision on priorities.

Gibson Biddle 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"The hardest part in that model is, how do you balance delight versus margin? ... In this case, both right, right? We saw a very small change in retention. That was the surprise. And so, it went from something like 4.5% canceled in the control. It was 4.45. Very small change."  Tactical:  Run A/B tests to measure the delta in retention for high-cost featuresCalculate the Lifetime Value (LTV) of saved customers to determine the financial value of a retention improvementCompare the financial value of retention against the cost of implementation or inventory

Gina Gotthilf 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"If as a startup, whether it be early stage, but as a startup you focus too much on those marginal differences between groups of people, you can run the risk of making big mistakes, which is making too many changes too soon and learning very little and adding crazy amounts of code complexity and overall organizational complexity to what you're building... It's important to keep things super simple... every new A/B test you want to run or every new hypothesis you have, if you now have a version of your app that's different in Mexico, in China, in India, whatever, you're going to have to run that test and whatever change you have in all of those versions... and time is almost more important than money when you're a startup."  Tactical:  Resist the urge to customize the product for marginal cultural differences early on.Maintain a single global version of the product as long as possible to keep code complexity low.Apply the 80/20 rule: focus on the 80% of shared human behavior rather than the 20% of cultural nuance.

"Everything you want is on the other side of worse first... If I'm optimizing for tomorrow and I just want to have a great day tomorrow, I'm going to stay exactly where I am, because my life will be better tomorrow if I don't make any changes... So if you realize this and instead ask the question, the version of myself five years from now, what would they wish I was going to do right now?"  Tactical:  Evaluate decisions based on what your '5-year future self' would wantRecognize that the 'first move' in any positive change (fitness, career, relationships) is usually negative or painfulAvoid plateauing by intentionally choosing the 'hard' path today for a better outcome later    "I think the time to quit is when you can no longer see the vision and you can no longer really believe the vision."  Tactical:  Distinguish between 'dark days' (temporary lack of excitement) and a fundamental loss of belief in the visionLook for 'bright spots' (small wins) to decide if a strategy is worth scaling before quitting

"There's no free lunch. You don't get something for free. You have to give up something. Then what do you give up? It's essentially you give up the right thing that market or your user wants at that given space and time. It's just the craft of building a business or building a product."  Tactical:  Identify the 'optimized function' for the current market and align trade-offs to it.Balance technology trade-offs (what is possible) with human behavior trade-offs (what people are willing to learn).

Jackson Shuttleworth 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"This idea of flexibility versus perfection, and then regardless, celebration, is core to how we think about the streak. Because I think for the streak for us, it's very much a bend not break."  Tactical:  Build 'insurance' mechanics (like streak freezes) to allow for user error without total progress loss.

Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We'll plot those options on these axes of easy to use versus hard to use and perfect solution to the customer problem versus this is just an okay solution... we call this activity magic lenses."  Tactical:  Use 'Magic Lenses' to evaluate product approaches: The Customer Lens, The Pragmatic Lens (cheap/fast), The Growth Lens, and The Financial Lens.Plot different approaches on 2x2s for each lens to see which one is the most viable overall.

Listen to episode →

"We spend a lot of time quantifying things in terms of a common currency. ... if we have, say, a dollar to spend, we know what we get depending on where we put it, over what timeframe."  Tactical:  Build models that translate disparate metrics (e.g., delivery time, price, selection) into a single output metric like GOV or volume.Use this common currency to decide whether to invest in marketing, logistics, or merchant acquisition.

John Cutler 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"In some environments there's this should/can divide... some people are just locked into the can. They're uber pragmatic people... And then there's people who for some reason go in and say, 'Should we do it? What should we do here? If those things were not an issue, what should we do?'"  Tactical:  Explicitly ask 'What should we do if technical debt weren't an issue?' to separate strategic intent from execution constraints.

Julie Zhuo 1 quote

"What you really want is you want to diagnose with data and treat with design. Data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build... but it can tell you if you have a problem and where that problem or opportunity might be."  Tactical:  Use data to capture reality and identify gaps, but rely on design/intuition to invent the solution.

Kayvon Beykpour 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"The difficulty in making product decisions comes down ultimately to making these trade-off decisions and you have to look at things through the lens of the customer. You have to balance that with what's driving the right business outcomes."  Tactical:  Explicitly identify when a business-critical metric (like revenue) is in conflict with a better user experience.

Mayur Kamat 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"In FinTech, every trade-off is existential. When you found a company, every trade-off is existential. You may not exist as a business if you make a wrong decision."  Tactical:  Identify which decisions are 'existential' versus 'reversible' to determine the depth of analysis required.

Naomi Ionita 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"If you know that you have a bridge to move up market, then giving up the long tail of individual users can be very worthwhile... Figma is a great example of that. This was a company that took a while to monetize. And even having free usage at the individual level, that was the way to just drive insane community and love for this product."  Tactical:  Optimize for growth over revenue in early-stage multiplayer products to build community and stickiness

Nicole Forsgren 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"It comes down to really clearly defining what your criteria is. What's important, and then among that criteria what's most important... identify the criteria that are most important to you... for each criteria, what's their relative weight, what's their importance? And I make it add up to 100%. And then I... give everything a score, and I just multiply it out."  Tactical:  Create a decision-making spreadsheet listing all options and weighted criteria.Use the exercise of defining criteria to gain clarity, as the process often reveals the right answer before the math is finished.Set a 'cutoff' for funding or selection to ensure you don't try to execute on too many strategies at once.

"I always ask, 'What are you optimizing for?' That's the question, it's what are you optimizing for? And it's the short, medium, lon-term in product, but it's what are you optimizing for today, this quarter, this year?"  Tactical:  Ask 'What are we optimizing for?' at the start of planning sessions or when stuck on a decisionUse the answer to this question to filter out low-priority tasks and resolve conflicts

Ramesh Johari 1 quote

"Marketplaces are a little bit like a game of whac-a-mole... Many of the changes that are most consequential create winners and losers. And rolling with those changes is about recognizing whether the winners you've created are more important to your business than the losers you've created in the process."  Tactical:  When launching a feature, explicitly identify who will 'lose' (e.g., unbadged hosts) and decide if the 'winners' (e.g., badged hosts) provide more net value to the ecosystem.

"What's that cost? Well, when they unsubscribe, we can't mail them. So we did some data science study on the side and we said, 'What is the value that we're losing from an unsubscribe?' And we came up with a number, it was a few dollars. But the point was, now we have this countervailing metric. We say, 'Here's the money that we generate from the emails. Here's the money that we're losing on long-term value. What's the trade-off?'"  Tactical:  Assign a dollar value to negative user actions like unsubscribes or churnModel the trade-off between immediate campaign revenue and long-term user lifetime value

"Facebook may be the most extreme example of trying to solve so many different problems... a big part of the product manager's job in a situation like that is going to be managing trade-offs... In Facebook's case, sometimes it's, 'Oh, if we do this, we just can't do this.' ... Whereas at a startup, a lot of it is time. Time is the main variable."  Tactical:  Identify if a decision is a 'one-way door' with permanent second-order effects or a sequencing decision.In high-growth environments, prioritize based on which actions unlock future capabilities (order of operations).

"Now, we can have a really cool conversation about trade-offs. So, let’s say we’ve got three different integrations here... If we just did this on one of those branches, would it be a win? And if we did it on all three, how much more time would we have to negotiate for and would it feel worth it?"  Tactical:  Evaluate the cost-benefit of covering edge cases versus shipping a simpler version for the majority of users.Negotiate the 'appetite' based on the technical complexity discovered during shaping.

Sander Schulhoff 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"If our models are smarter, more people can use them to solve harder tasks and make more money. And then on the security side, it's like, or we can invest in security and they're more robust, but not smarter. And you have to have the intelligence first to be able to sell something."  Tactical:  Understand that foundational models may prioritize capabilities over absolute security in their development cycles

Shreyas Doshi 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We use data when it favors us, we use anecdotes when it favors us... we exit the QBR, you high-five each other. Well, 'Good job, team, great job,' et cetera, et cetera. But now, you have signed up for even more work for a feature you should not have built in the first place. That's why we're busy. And through a product leader's life, what happens is we just accumulate all of this debt, feature after feature."  Tactical:  Avoid building features just because an engineer is 'free.'Be honest about feature adoption data rather than relying on favorable anecdotes to look competent.Recognize that every new feature launch commits the team to future maintenance and 'table stakes' additions.

Stewart Butterfield 1 quote

"The difference that you could possibly achieve between having this feature and not having this feature is like this much... The cost of doing the analysis was this much. So it's guaranteed to be a loser."

"The driver performance metrics, they span across safety, the compliance to the road rules, our ability to make adequate progress as in not get unduly stopped or stranded in dense traffic situations... you can be very safe if you're not moving at all. That's not what we're building. We need to make sure that the riders get to their destination on time."  Tactical:  Identify the tension between caution (safety) and utility (progress).Measure 'undue' slowdowns to ensure the product remains useful while maintaining its safety bar.

Teresa Torres 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I think the best way to guard against what you think is the obvious solution is to work with multiple solutions for the same opportunity. Compare and contrast. We already know this intuitively... When you're looking for a job, you don't talk to one company. We know if we want to make good decisions, we need options and we need to evaluate the pros and cons of each."  Tactical:  Work with at least three solutions for the same opportunityCompare and contrast the pros and cons of different options

Uri Levine 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"In general, I would say letting people go is probably better than reducing salary for everyone. But let's say that you need cost reduction of 30%. One of the options is let 30% of the people go. Another option is actually reduce salary by 30% for everyone... If the organization feels that they are committed to each other, they will prefer the second way. If this is more of individuals, then obviously they will prefer the first way."  Tactical:  Assess the team's internal cohesion before deciding between layoffs and salary reductions.Consider having management give up their salaries first as a demonstration of leadership before impacting the broader team.

"If you have a choice and you choose the easy thing and it works great. If you choose the hard thing and it works great, you did more work, but if it doesn't work and you chose the easy thing, you've actually not learned anything... But if you do the hard path and it doesn't work, actually you still win because you've now done something hard."  Tactical:  Evaluate options based on 'learning ROI' rather than just ease of executionChoose the path that builds more valuable long-term skills or infrastructure

"Oftentimes we'll use a traffic light. That means that the three options are three rows. The columns in the table will be criteria by which to evaluate the options... And then obviously it should be color-coded, red, yellow, green based on how it stacks up against those criteria."  Tactical:  Create a matrix with options as rows and evaluation criteria as columnsColor-code cells (Red/Yellow/Green) to show how each option performs against criteria

Horizon two, which is an adjacent thing... usually that tends to be around 20%... Then there's horizon three, which is three years out... and that's about 10%."  Tactical:  Allocate roughly 10% of resources to 'Horizon 3' bets that won't pay off for 3-5 years.Adjust the 70/20/10 ratio based on a team's specific technical debt or innovation mandate.
