User Onboarding  User onboarding is the design of the first-time user experience that leads to the 'aha' moment where users understand and feel the product's value. The biggest lever for retention is often inflecting this early experience. Getting the first 30 seconds right can drive word-of-mouth growth more than any marketing campaign.

Read Guide

The Guide  4 key steps synthesized from 4 experts.

1 Make the first 30 seconds magical  Focus obsessively on the very first moments of the product experience. This is where first impressions form and where users decide whether to invest more attention. Everything should work to get users to value as quickly as possible - remove friction, defer account creation, and show the core experience immediately.

Featured guest perspectives

"We are going to do everything we possibly can to make the first 30 seconds of the product feel magical."

— Grant Lee        2 Design from onboarding backwards  Rather than building features and then figuring out how to explain them, design your product starting from the onboarding experience. This game design principle ensures the product is inherently intuitive. If you can't onboard users elegantly, that's a signal the product itself needs simplification.

Featured guest perspectives

"My thoughts and feelings about onboarding really go back to my experience designing games where I would design the game from the onboarding experience."

— Merci Grace        3 Treat onboarding as your biggest retention lever  When looking for retention wins, start with the early user experience. The data consistently shows that the biggest impact comes from getting users to value faster, not from reactivation campaigns or feature additions. Invest disproportionately in the first mile of your user journey.

Featured guest perspectives

"Very often I think the biggest wins in retention come from inflecting the early user experience."

— Dan Hockenmaier        4 Invest heavily in the final months before launch  Onboarding often gets left until the end, but it deserves significant investment in the final stretch. The product features might be complete, but there's often something holding people back. Spend the last months before launch refining the path to the aha moment.

Featured guest perspectives

"We worked a lot on the onboarding process in the last couple of months of launch and that was really pivotal because the product features were there... but there was this thing holding people back."

— Cam Adams

✗ Common Mistakes

Using carousels or instructional overlays that users swipe through without readingRequiring account creation before showing any product valueBuilding features first and trying to explain them in onboarding laterUsing non-native frameworks that feel disconnected from your actual product     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Your time-to-value is measured in seconds, not minutes or hoursUsers reach the aha moment before they've finished signing upActivation rates improve consistently as you iterate on onboardingWord-of-mouth referrals mention how easy it was to get started
