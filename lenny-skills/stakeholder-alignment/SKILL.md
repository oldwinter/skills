Stakeholder Alignment  Stakeholder alignment is the invisible skill that makes everything else possible—without it, even great work gets blocked, deprioritized, or ignored. The best practitioners treat alignment as an ongoing process of relationship-building and communication, not a one-time sign-off meeting.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 88 experts.

1 Involve stakeholders early when ideas are still fuzzy  Don't come to stakeholders with a finished proposal asking for approval. Involve them early when you're still exploring, so their input shapes the direction. This builds ownership—people support what they help create. The journey of building alignment is as important as the destination.

Featured guest perspectives

"Most of the time when people come to me and they want to ask how to get buy-in, they've got a date in mind, they've got a particular meeting... That's the wrong attitude. It's more of a journey."

— Megan Cook    "I've seen director level people who will try to work on strategy in a vacuum alone... because you did not bring people along on that journey, they did not feel like they had a hand in crafting it themselves."

— Nickey Skarstad        2 Present options with a recommendation, not binary choices  Never come with just one option (invites poking holes) or no recommendation (seems unprepared). Present 3 options with clear trade-offs and your recommended path. This structure invites productive discussion while establishing your point of view.

Featured guest perspectives

"Options and a recommendation is kind of the magic formula... if you come in and say, 'Here are three options, here are the trade-offs, here's the one we recommend,' then every little bit of back and forth makes those options clearer."

— Matt LeMay    "If there is a decision, I need three options and I need a recommendation... that should hopefully help focus the meeting."

— Naomi Gleit        3 Learn each stakeholder's language and constraints  Different stakeholders care about different things—executives want strategic impact, engineering wants technical feasibility, legal wants risk mitigation. Translate your message into terms that resonate with each audience. Speaking their language builds credibility and trust.

Featured guest perspectives

"You have to learn the different parts of the business... you have to convince those stakeholders that you understand what the issues are."

— Marty Cagan    "It depends on what your leadership chain really cares about... focus on speed if they care about market share, focus on cost savings if they care about profit margin."

— Nicole Forsgren        4 Communicate with extreme repetition and consistency  You are sick of your message long before your stakeholders have internalized it. Repeat your key points across multiple channels and formats until alignment is solid. Naomi Gleit calls it 'extreme clarity'—everyone having the same understanding of facts, options, and trade-offs.

Featured guest perspectives

"The old adage of you need to say something three times before people understand it. I would wager you need to say it another three times before they internalize it."

— Tim Holley    "The importance of relentlessly repeating the exact same stuff over and over again, even if you feel like everyone definitely knows... I repeated the same three talking points 5,000 times."

— Zoelle Egner        5 Distinguish between misunderstanding and disagreement  When facing pushback, first determine: Is this person misunderstanding your position, or do they understand and disagree? If it's misunderstanding, clarify until they can articulate your view. If it's genuine disagreement, stop debating and escalate to a decision-maker.

Featured guest perspectives

"Are you disagreeing or misunderstanding? If you're misunderstanding, let's spend the time. Let's get to a point where you can articulate my point of view in your words... if we're disagreeing, let's stop."

— Tomer Cohen    "When someone disagrees with me, I tend to immediately stop and say, 'Cool, let's figure out why there's disagreement.'... What is our divergence point?"

— Tobi Lutke        6 Use visual artifacts to create shared understanding  Words mean different things to different people. Diagrams, prototypes, and visual documents create concrete reference points that prevent people from talking past each other. Sketch on a whiteboard, share screenshots, or create a Figma mock—anything that makes alignment tangible.

Featured guest perspectives

"When people can see that and it accompanies your verbal narrative, they can actually understand what you're conveying... those moments of alignment are so important."

— Nancy Duarte    "We have people share screenshots or prototypes of what they're working on in a shared deck... it's a really great way for them to understand what we're building together."

— Katie Dill

✗ Common Mistakes

Coming to stakeholders with finished proposals instead of involving them in shaping the directionUsing the same framing for all stakeholders instead of tailoring to their concernsAssuming one conversation creates lasting alignment instead of reinforcing repeatedlyConfusing disagreement with misunderstanding and debating endlessly     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Stakeholders proactively advocate for your initiatives in rooms you're not inDecisions happen faster because pre-alignment work is done before meetingsCross-functional partners seek out your input on their projectsYou're invited to important decision-making meetings as essential, not optional

"How do you manage stakeholders? And this is hard in growth because often growth can be viewed as at odds with really thoughtful and quality craftsmanship and product building, but it's not. Those things go hand in hand. And so you really have to win people over on what it means to do growth."  Tactical:  Communicate how a series of experiments fit into a larger strategic betIdentify the 'currency' different stakeholders trade in to tailor your communication style

"The hardest part is taking my own shoes off. Basically going, Yo, okay, I came into this, there's something I wanted, I wanted to get rid of that. Now just talk to this person and try to understand what's going on with them... Once I have the empathy, I'm then able to think about what we as an organization broadly want to achieve."  Tactical:  Identify common objectives to overcome the 'us vs. them' mentality in cross-functional relationships.Ask stakeholders about their life goals and what they are scared of to build genuine empathy.

"Surfacing those [experiment wins] across the company... the onus is on them to clearly articulate what their hypothesis is, what they found such that then as a growth leader, I can encourage people to swarm around that and try a bunch of different ideas."  Tactical:  Create a centralized way to share experiment hypotheses and results to encourage cross-team 'swarming' on winning insights.

Ami Vora 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Working with Ami, it was like watching an alien because she could have the most profound disagreement in the world with somebody and they would say something that she thought was not just wrong, but crazy wrong, and she would respond, 'Fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that.'"  Tactical:  Use the phrase 'Fascinating, tell me more why you think that' when you hear an idea you strongly disagree with.Assume the other person has information you don't have yet.Take a pause before responding to allow your 'primal' visceral reaction to calm down.    "Assume that executives have a little tiny dinosaur brain. We all have a little brontosaurus brain and we can really only hold three facts at the same time. We will never be able to go deep in the way that you are able to do on everything that crosses our desk. And so the best service you can do is actually do the work of making a recommendation."  Tactical:  Present the minimal amount of information needed to support a recommendation.Own the recommendation while letting the manager/executive own the broader context.Use product reviews to calibrate on principles rather than just getting a single 'yes/no' decision.

Anneka Gupta 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"One of the tactics I use is I ask people to present their strategies for things that I think we may need to do a course correction on, and I have them come in and then I ask them questions and then I make suggestion. And I'm able to do that in a forum where it doesn't feel like I'm coming in and rewriting the entire strategy, but I'm giving them there an opportunity to present their best thinking..."  Tactical:  Invite teams to present strategies early to provide feedback before decisions are finalized.Seed hypotheses based on external data (e.g., customer feedback) to open a discussion rather than shutting it down.    "I really try to understand what drives that person. What is it that they really care about? ... I just need to understand what it is that they really care about, and then if I need something from them, what is it that I can do to motivate them to find what I need from them important?"  Tactical:  Talk to peers or direct reports of a difficult stakeholder to understand what makes them 'tick.'Connect your project's success to the specific goals or desires of the stakeholder you are trying to influence.

April Dunford 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"if we're going to fix this thing, we can't just have the marketing department or just the product managers sit down and cook up new positioning and then heave it over the wall to everybody else, it actually needs to be a group effort. It's a team sport."  Tactical:  Avoid 'heaving positioning over the wall' from marketing to other teamsInvolve sales and product early in the positioning process    "if we're going to do a positioning exercise, ideally we've got marketing, product, sales, customer success, and anybody else we need from the executive team, particularly the CEO, together in a room when we're building it. So that we can all bring our expertise to the table, bring our understanding of what customers do and our product to the table, thrash around on it a little bit until we get agreement on it."  Tactical:  Include the CEO, Sales, Product, and Customer Success in positioning workshopsFacilitate 'thrashing' sessions to surface different perspectives on customer behavior

"I think that this person, the secret sauce is more of how good of a cross-functional team player are they. I almost view them like a true quarterback... marketing technology because it lives between so many departments, it plays that role of having to call plays and pull on different departments."  Tactical:  Focus on building relationships with heads of Revenue Ops, Product, and Data to ensure system changes are supported.Use persuasion and salesmanship to justify engineering resources for internal platform improvements.

Bangaly Kaba 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I found this framework... called managing complex change. It's got these five components to it, vision, skills, incentives, resources, action plan, and you need all of those to have change."  Tactical:  Diagnose team issues by identifying the symptom: confusion (missing vision), anxiety (missing skills), resistance (missing incentives), frustration (missing resources), or false starts (missing action plan).Start with action plans as they are easier to institute than changing vision or skills.

Barbra Gago 2 quotes

"A big part of rebranding also means that you have to bring the whole company along too and make sure they feel really good about the outcome. And that was probably one of my big takeaways, is just at that time, we were already about a hundred people, so it wasn't a super small company, and everybody had thoughts and feelings and the company had been around for quite a long time before that."  Tactical:  Involve the whole company in the rebranding process to ensure buy-inAcknowledge and manage the emotional connection employees have to the old brand    "With the rebrand at Miro, it was very much rebrand as a product approach. It was very much a product development process with sprint teams and agile, coming back, and you had owners for different parts of things and all reporting back and it really required everybody in some way to be involved... mobilizing, having a really strong clear process and delegating and letting go in the marketing role."  Tactical:  Use agile sprint teams for rebranding tasksAssign clear owners for different components of the rebrandDelegate tasks across the organization rather than centralizing everything in marketing

Benjamin Mann 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I think part of why we publish these things is we want other labs to be aware of the risks... I think if you talk to policymakers, they really appreciate this kind of thing because they feel like we're giving them the straight talk and that's what we strive to do, that they can trust us, that we're not going to paper things over or sugarcoat things."  Tactical:  Publish 'straight talk' about model risks and laboratory failures to establish credibility with external stakeholdersUse a 'Responsible Scaling Policy' (ASL levels) to communicate risk thresholds to non-technical stakeholders

Ben Horowitz 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"the job is fundamentally a leadership job. And it's a tricky leadership job because nobody is actually reporting to you. So it's like this influence, how do I get people to do what I want even though I'm not paying them. I can't fire them. I can't promote them"  Tactical:  Focus on clarity of communication to ensure engineering understands the 'why' and 'what'Build authority through vision and market insight rather than organizational hierarchy    "The way it works is there's somebody who's got to consolidate, get all the good ideas, prioritize them, decide which good ideas we're going to do, and then get everybody on the same page, so that they have very high fidelity understanding of what that is."  Tactical:  Act as the 'consolidator' of ideas rather than the sole source of themEnsure the team has a 'high fidelity understanding' of the chosen path

Bob Baxley 1 quote

"I knew that design can't bring you this stuff into the world on its own. We can't raise this baby, we need the village, and we need the village to fall in love with the baby. And so until that happens, you're not really quite sure if this thing's going to take off or not."  Tactical:  Bring key engineers and PMs into the process at the moment of inception so they feel like co-creators rather than order-takers.

Bill Carr 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"What it means is that have backbone and disagree, meaning when we are making any kind of a decision, important decision, if you are part of that team, part of that unit, it is your obligation to voice your point of view if you disagree with your approach that's been taken. The point of that disagreement, by the way, is to provide usually additional information or a new point of view that people have not considered."  Tactical:  Make it an obligation for team members to voice disagreements during the decision processEnsure the leader acknowledges and understands the dissenting point of view before asking for commitment    "The point is you provided your information, they've processed that information and they've decided to go this way with the knowledge of that. That is the point for them to commit. Because the point is you provided your information, they've processed that information and they've decided to go this way with the knowledge of that. That is the point for them to commit."  Tactical:  Once a decision is made, commit fully to the direction even if you still disagreeReflect the final decision's rationale back to your own organization to ensure alignment

Tactical:  Address the delta between internal reality and external perception (e.g., stock market or media narratives).Explain the rationale for a balanced portfolio of investments to both employees and investors.

Cam Adams 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"In terms of board meetings, I think it's been very helpful that our financials and our growth have been amazing for so many years that we don't need to focus on it and we can just have that one slide with the graph going up and to the right. We've also attracted investors who believe in us and who understand that us driving product and getting as much product value out to our customers is probably the most important thing we can be doing. So that's why the board meetings do focus on that because what we are launching in the product, what's ahead is really determining the success of the company."  Tactical:  Structure board decks to prioritize product updates and roadmap over financial minutiaeSelect investors who prioritize long-term product value over short-term margin pulling

"Leadership interviews are a very important part of a strategy formulation process... It could be made so much better if you just engage with your leaders before you actually build a strategy."  Tactical:  Interview leaders to define what success and failure look like to themAsk leaders for their 'pet ideas' to remove the mystery and build creative buy-inIdentify 'gatekeepers' for 1:1 pre-alignment before a broad strategy rollout    "I would start with what I call gatekeepers. And these are people who are absolutely... You have to get their one-on-one alignment and blessing on this before it moves forward."  Tactical:  Pre-flight the strategy with 2-3 key gatekeepers in 1:1 meetingsConduct small-group roadshows (8-10 people) to allow for conversational Q&AUse the criteria and scoring from the strategy sprint to defend choices during reviews

Chris Hutchins 2 quotes

"you think that customer research is all you need to build a product at a company, but figuring out how to create excitement internally and get buy-in from other teams because they're the ones that are going to build it. They're the ones that are going to help market. It's all a team effort."  Tactical:  Build influence within the company to support your product betsFocus on persuading internal teams who will execute the vision    "when you push so hard for your ideas and you have really strong beliefs, you have to also make sure you state your intent. Because sometimes people think you're acting out of self-interest... 'Hey guys, I've got some crazy ideas, but before I say them, I just want you to know that all I care about is that the company is successful.'"  Tactical:  Prefix controversial or bold ideas with a statement of intentClarify that you do not care about 'owning' the idea, only its success

Tactical:  Repeat core messages across multiple channels (email, video, meetings)Adopt the role of 'repeater-in-chief' to ensure alignment

David Placek 3 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Most clients... come to a naming project absolutely believing, with full confidence, that they're going to know it when they see it, and the truth is it almost never happens."  Tactical:  Educate stakeholders early that they likely won't 'know it when they see it'Warn teams that the best names often feel uncomfortable initially    "We look for polarization. We look for tension in a team arguing about these things. Polarization is a sign of strength in the word."  Tactical:  Don't seek consensus; look for names that spark debate and strong reactions    "We really try to give that advice for it because it is about being successful in the marketplace. And so first of all, we try to separate the clients that we work with. We really want to work with clients that play to win, that want to win, not just want to not lose in a marketplace."  Tactical:  Frame naming decisions around market winning rather than internal comfortUse prototypes (mock-up ads, merchandise) to help executives visualize the name in the real world

"I realized that Silicon Valley did not talk to Washington DC and or Brussels or other parts of the world. And given how important this technology is, we need to bring everybody on board. So we created multiple programs from congressional bootcamp to AI index report to policy briefing, and we especially participated in policymaking."  Tactical:  Create educational bridges (like bootcamps or reports) to help non-technical stakeholders understand complex technology.Advocate for shared resources, such as a national AI research cloud, to democratize access and align interests.

Dylan Field 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"One of them is just, how do you unpack context? How do you get the context you've got in your head and really unpack it for a group? Another is, how to make sure that you're showing up in a way that folks know that we're all working towards the same goal?"  Tactical:  Explicitly 'unpack' the context behind your thinking for the teamEnsure the team understands that everyone is working toward a unified objective    "I think it's your job as a leader to always try to investigate those areas, push on them, and if something's not adding up, really ask the hard questions and not shy away from them... I just try to keep pushing through that until we get to a point of, 'Okay, we at least know what we're trading off.'"  Tactical:  Investigate areas of a project that feel 'murky' or unclearPush for clarity on trade-offs even if the team doesn't fully agree on the path

Emily Kramer 1 quote

"We had a list of areas of responsibility which is just who owns what, it's not your job title. It's what are the things that you are the DRI for? It doesn't mean you're not going to collaborate with people on those things. So what are you the directly responsible individual for? And this made it really easy to know who to go to."  Tactical:  Maintain a public list of DRIs for specific tasks (e.g., website tests, onboarding copy).Update AORs as the team grows to ensure new hires know exactly what they own.

Listen to episode →

"The starting point for influence is to choose your character and choose your mode... Am I the devil's advocate approach, or I'm the break it and see if it still stands after I hit it really hard with a sledgehammer kind of guy."  Tactical:  Choose an influence 'character' (e.g., protector, caregiver, logic-based) that fits your personality.Explicitly ask for permission to play a specific role, like 'devil's advocate,' to reduce friction.    "The moderate influence... is the concept of teaching people something. And then when they live with this new knowledge, they'll see things that they weren't seeing before."  Tactical:  Use the 'Challenger' approach: teach stakeholders something new and let them experience the world with that knowledge.Avoid 'cramming' ideas down throats; give people a few days to live with new information before seeking a decision.

"It is not just your job to get what you can get done with the resources in front of you. It's your job to marshal resources both inside your org and across your organization... you need to go out and do that work now. It is not just your job to get what you can get done with the resources in front of you."  Tactical:  Propose the specific resources (people, budget, cross-functional support) required to solve a problem rather than just accepting what is assignedPartner deeply with marketing, sales, and finance to ensure their roadmaps support your product goalsOwn the business outcome and impact rather than just the delivery of a specific feature set

"As the company gets bigger, you can actually create alignment by causing internal virality... we would create these prototype products... and then we would just share the build and it would explode."  Tactical:  Build functional prototypes rather than just writing PRDs to demonstrate value to stakeholders.Share early builds internally to see if they resonate with employees before a full rollout.Use internal momentum to bypass slow alignment processes and create a sense of urgency.

"It made communicating with especially the product team and the engineering team a lot easier for me. So we were using a shared language. The rest of the company who aren't necessarily customer facing really understood, I think, at a different level what we were all doing together in KPIs."

Gustav Söderström 1 quote

"I think the promise we should make to all employees is that even if they don't agree, they should be entitled to understand why you're making the decision. What I don't think is acceptable is to say, 'No, we're going to do it this way because I'm more senior.'"  Tactical:  Use Socratic debate to ensure the best idea wins regardless of seniorityForce yourself to explain instincts out loud; if you can't explain it, you likely don't understand it yet

Hilary Gridley 3 quotes

Listen to episode →

"What is much more helpful than understanding what your CEO thinks is, I think understanding how your CEO thinks. And that goes for all sorts of levels of the company. I want to understand how all the strategic leaders at my company think, and I want my team to understand how I think."  Tactical:  Analyze the recurring themes in a leader's feedback (e.g., 'this must feel like the future').Translate executive feedback into actionable principles for the team.Ask 'In what world does this make sense for this person?' to understand conflicting viewpoints.    "I talk about what I like to call the magic questions, but the thing about magic questions is they're not actually questions, they're statements and they end with, 'Do you agree?' Or 'Is that right?' ... I have found this, the most helpful way for kind of trying to understand a person's mental model is to just put facts in front of them and see what they say no to and what they say yes to."  Tactical:  Instead of open-ended questions, state your interpretation of their rule or preference.End the statement with 'Is that right?' or 'Do you agree?'Use this to calibrate your judgment against theirs over time.    "Separate out my opinion from it, from the, 'Well, what is the insight that makes it make sense to this person' and explain their rationale. Even if I'm comfortable saying, 'I don't necessarily think this isn't how I would do it,' or 'I don't even really agree with how they're thinking about it, but from their point of view, from their perspective, their professional experience, whatever it is, I could see how this makes sense.'"  Tactical:  Perform the 'What if I'm wrong?' exercise to find the hidden insight in a leader's decision.Acknowledge your own disagreement while validating the leader's perspective to the team.Commit to executing the decision fully to see if the leader's hypothesis is correct.

"A product manager role is a very influential role and a lot of the things you do is influencing other people... You need to influence the engineering team to build a product that you want them to build. You need to influence the revenue team to go with a go to market and sell the product the way you envision it."  Tactical:  Build influencing skills early in your PM careerAlign the revenue team with the product vision to ensure effective go-to-market execution    "When I'm coming to something and I see all the issues that need to be fixed... you don't take people with you through that journey. So really analyzing that not everyone appreciate change the way you are... taking a step back and assessing what is happening so you can take the team with you on that journey of changing."  Tactical:  Slow down and explain the 'why' behind a change to get buy-inAdjust your communication style to fit the specific culture and character of the team

Ian McAllister 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Trust is the currency of a product leader... Trust is just built by repeatedly setting and meeting expectations. And I think that's a good mantra to think about as a FM. Am I meeting the expectations that I set? And not just doing good things, but calling your shots, forecasting, setting a goal, and then hitting it."

"For the next two weeks, say yes to everything... I think you can find a way to do your job and still say yes to people. You can say, 'yes, I agree. That is a real problem. Yes. I think we could test this design with users' and just see what's different with two weeks of saying yes to people instead of no."  Tactical:  Practice 'saying yes' to the validity of the problem being raisedUse user testing as a collaborative way to evaluate stakeholder ideas instead of flat rejection    "Anytime you have these disagreements that feel really torny or they feel like a disagreement in values, that's a sign that really have a disagreement in strategy and that it's worth it to write down what your strategic framework is or what your strategic principle is and address the problem at that level, rather than fighting over individual features or individual decisions."  Tactical:  Identify 'repeated disagreements' as a signal to pause and define strategyResolve conflicts by aligning on strategic principles first

"Pushback is, I couldn't imagine a word more viscerally that makes you feel like you're sort of physically going against what somebody else wants, and it gears people into a mindset of then, well, how should I push back. It starts from a place of I need to disagree, I need to say no. It's a very negative mindset, purely based on the word that has come to label a behavior that alternatively could be about how do I shift the direction on something, or how do I help the business actually succeed when I disagree with somebody about something, and that's a very different mindset."  Tactical:  Understand the underlying goal or issue the stakeholder has before disagreeing.Align your alternative direction with the stakeholder's ultimate goal.

Are you willing to reconsider this?"

Because each circle is going to assume that the inner circle knows better than them and they're going to follow the lead of the inner circle...

Tactical:  Frame requests in terms of how they affect the team's ability to hit its impact goals.If forced to take on a new task, explicitly adjust the projected impact of existing goals to reflect the trade-off.    "Options and a recommendation is kind of the magic formula... when you present a single option, people's instinct is just to... start poking holes in it... whereas if you come in and say, 'Here are three options, here are the trade-offs, here's the one we recommend,' then every little bit of back and forth makes those options clearer and stronger."  Tactical:  Always present at least three options for major decisions.Include a specific recommendation to provide a starting point for the conversation.

So you have to convince those stakeholders that you understand what the issues are"  Tactical:  Learn the specific constraints of marketing, sales, and compliance departmentsShow stakeholders prototypes early to ensure business viability    "The third is unencumbered access to the stakeholders because a good product is solving what's just now possible... in ways that work for the business, which is why the stakeholder access is so critical. If you have those three things, direct access to those three things, that's what's critical."  Tactical:  Maintain direct, unmediated access to business stakeholdersDo not delegate stakeholder management to intermediaries    "You are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

"Not pursuing this in both a top-down and a bottom-up structure, right. And I think that can really help drive success, and having good communication throughout is super, super important, right. So getting your ICs bought in and helping them understand that this is for them... And then chatting with leaders and understanding what their motivations are."  Tactical:  Communicate to ICs that measurement is a tool for their benefit, not for surveillance.Translate technical improvements into business value points that resonate with executive leadership's strategic priorities.    "In part, it depends on what your leadership chain really cares about... If they've been talking about market share? Losing market share or competitiveness in the marketplace, if that's it, focus on speed... if they're talking about profit margin all the time... look for ways that you can save money and then translate that into recovered and recouped headcount cost."  Tactical:  Listen for recurring themes in leadership communication (e.g., 'velocity', 'margin', 'transformation').Translate technical improvements (like faster builds) into business outcomes (like cloud cost savings or faster time-to-market).

"Jack was just listening through all of that... And then I remember very distinctly, he asked me one question which was something to the effect of, how does this make our users love Twitter more? Simple question. But then at some point I realized, yeah, we never really talked about that because we were so engrossed in all the other stuff."  Tactical:  Use simple, fundamental questions about user value to refocus a distracted or overly technical stakeholder meeting.    "There are three levels of product work, impact, execution, and optics... we litigate the minutiae of whatever issue we are discussing, but we never really recognize that it's because we are default thinking at different levels. And so, this realization helped me better understand why there were conflicts between two very smart and well intentioned people."  Tactical:  Identify the default 'level' of your stakeholder (Impact, Execution, or Optics) and adjust your communication to match it.Use the vocabulary of these three levels to objectively diagnose misalignments in product reviews.    "I noticed that actually, if you have a real product strategy, a real one that everybody is aligned with, that you have got pre-alignment on, then a lot of this nonsense we tend to do with annual planning actually goes away."  Tactical:  Get alignment on the strategy *before* the formal planning season begins.Use the strategy as a rigorous framework to handle escalations from sales or support.

"watch for these different eyes light up moments because their face can't lie... those are great fodder for content that you might want to write about, for the angle of your sales pitch, for how you might want to explain something in the future. And you really cut out all the parts that make people go dead in the eyes and just say the parts that make their eyes light up."  Tactical:  Observe the audience's face and demeanor to identify which specific points trigger genuine interest.Trim content that causes 'dead eyes' and double down on 'eyes light up' topics.    "Alex would always talk about trade-offs and he'd say, 'Wes, yes, I can design this PDF for you. That means that the thing that I was going to work on today, which was redesigning this page on the site, will have to wait until later this week.'... it went from being a conversation about yes or no... into, hey, how do we make sure that the important right things get done?"

Here's our strategy.' And it never goes well. And it doesn't go well. It might be the right strategy, but because you did not bring people along on that journey to come up with it, they did not feel like they had a hand in crafting it themselves."  Tactical:  Avoid writing strategy in a vacuum; involve the team early in the journeyTalk to leadership and the CEO to ensure organizational context is baked into the strategy    "I used Loom, which is another one of my favorite products... And so I just recapped, 'All right, here's what I presented to leadership. Here are the feedback that we got. Here's the strategic feedback that we got. And here are the changes we're going to make. Any questions, let me know.' And I posted it in Slack."  Tactical:  Record short Loom recaps of leadership meetings to share with the team immediatelyPost updates in Slack to maintain transparency and excitement without waiting for weekly meetings

What is our divergence point? Because you might be right. In fact, people often are, when it gets to this point, I found. Sometimes it's an unstated foundational assumption that I hold that is incorrect."  Tactical:  Actively seek out disagreement to build trust and uncover better ideasAsk 'What is our divergence point?' to find unstated assumptionsPlay devil's advocate if a proposal feels too predictable or lacks surprise
