Defining Product Vision  Product vision is the inspiring picture of what the world looks like when you succeed. It describes a future state for users that is agnostic of your specific solution—ambitious enough to be motivating, concrete enough that people can visualize it. A strong vision serves as the organizing principle for all decisions, from hiring to feature prioritization, and keeps teams building cathedrals instead of laying bricks.

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 101 experts.

1 Describe the future world, not your product  A powerful vision describes a future state for users that doesn't mention your company, product, or solution. Prefix vision statements with 'In the future...' to ensure long-term focus. The goal is to create an aspirational destination that pulls everyone forward, not a product description that constrains thinking.

Featured guest perspectives

"The vision is the nirvana state that you aim to enable for your users and customers in five to 10 years... It should be bound to your target market. So not too wide and not too narrow. And critically it should not mention your company, your product, or anything solution related at all."

— Ben Williams    "Imagine a world where someone can feel this way about their money.' And it's like, 'And then this thing will do that.' That's the product strategy. It's how you execute on it."

— Chris Hutchins    "Disneyland, still the best vision statement of all time, which is the happiest place on earth. So once you tell an employee this is supposed to be the happiest place on earth, then you're signaling all sorts of things about how they need to pick up the trash and how they need to show up on time."

— Bob Baxley        2 Make the vision concrete and visual  Abstract strategy documents don't create alignment. Use prototypes, mockups, and wireframes to make the vision tangible. When people can see the end state, they make better daily decisions. A strategy document isn't complete without visuals that show what the product will look like when the vision is realized.

Featured guest perspectives

"At Canva, we're all about visual communications... visions in the very visual sense. We need to be able to see it. We need mock-ups. We need prototypes. You need to get that idea out of your head and present it to someone in a visual form."

— Cam Adams    "One of the things that we said with stake that we put in the ground was the strategy doc wouldn't be complete without wireframes... when you actually can show people wireframes of what the product will look like when that strategy is implemented, it creates much more alignment."

— Ravi Mehta    "I actually took a screenshot of the Google Play Store... and then I created rounded rectangles, just blank rectangles, four panels. And then I printed that out and I gave everyone a sheet and I said, 'If we solve these problems... what would be the screenshots?'"

— Ebi Atawodi        3 Use emotional metaphors to guide decentralized decisions  When teams share an emotional understanding of what the product should feel like, they naturally make consistent choices without top-down control. Define the 'feeling' using relatable real-world analogies. This shared mental model guides everything from iconography to communication patterns.

Featured guest perspectives

"If we all agree that the feeling of something should be, I'm sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday, then people will just naturally build something that feels more consistent. You know what the iconography, the designers know what iconography should look like."

— Ami Vora    "Ultimately, we came up with the idea that we were in the belong anywhere business. Airbnb was not in home sharing, we were in belonging anywhere."

— Chip Conley        4 Think 10X, not incremental  Ambitious visions force teams to abandon incrementalism and find first-principles solutions. When you push for 10X improvement, people think about the problem differently. Start with the unconstrained '15 out of 10' experience, then work backwards to what's feasible. This prevents teams from settling into local maxima.

Featured guest perspectives

"The exercise isn't necessarily to say if people say they want to hit a goal, I say, okay, I added a zero, you have to hit that goal. It's more the exercise of what would it take to be 10X bigger or do something 10 times better? Because what you find is when you push people, they will sometimes think about the problem differently."

— Brian Chesky    "What Brian taught us was think unconstrained first. Think about a 15 out of 10 experience, design the ideal end state first. In most companies, the designers and PM start by saying, 'Okay, 10 is perfect. We can probably do seven. Let's start at seven.' It's a very constrained minded thinking."

— Sanchan Saxena    "The job is to delight customers. Like Peter Thiel, his book, From Zero to One. The job of an entrepreneur at the beginning is just to find out something that's 10X better."

— Gibson Biddle        5 Use backcasting to work from the future backward  Instead of forecasting from present constraints, start by imagining a radically different future and work backwards. This 'backcasting' approach helps you discover non-obvious paths and avoid the comparison trap of just being 'better' than competitors. Great founders propose futures that deny the premise of current rules.

Featured guest perspectives

"Great founders, pattern breakers back cast, they say, it's a given that the future has to be radically different for me to be a big winner, and so, I'm going to look for radically different futures and work backwards from those radically different futures."

— Mike Maples Jr    "I talk about look in the future and then think backwards a lot, right? It's like what would we want to have done 20 years ago on this?"

— Tobi Lutke    "I really like to start by just imagining what is the future that you actually want. Right now I have a wall in my house in my office, which is my vision for what I'd like the world to look like in 2050."

— Melanie Perkins        6 Repeat the vision relentlessly  Vision isn't a one-time announcement. It requires constant, repetitive storytelling to stick. Share it at every all-hands meeting. Ensure every team member can articulate why the product exists and what future you're building toward. You're communicating enough when you feel like you're repeating yourself endlessly.

Featured guest perspectives

"You have to state your vision and your mission and why you're here, every all-hands. It seems so crazy because it's core to you why we would build this... you need everyone to be able to... have a very cohesive narrative in their head."

— Chris Hutchins    "It was also just storytelling and just repetitive storytelling around this is the vision, these are the bets we're making. Here's why. And you can't just tell that story once."

— Kayvon Beykpour    "The core insight here is that you want your teams to feel like they're building a cathedral and not laying bricks... take the time to help the team take a broader frame, open the aperture a little bit and have a view of what the cathedral is."

— Lane Shackleton

✗ Common Mistakes

Writing a vision that's actually a product description or marketing taglineCreating vision documents without wireframes or visualsLetting current technical constraints limit your imaginationAnnouncing the vision once and assuming everyone absorbed itBuilding by committee instead of championing a singular, opinionated direction     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Anyone on the team can explain what the world looks like when you succeedTeams make consistent decisions autonomously because they understand the visionNew ideas are evaluated against the vision, not just ROIYour vision inspires people to join the companyThe vision hasn't changed fundamentally in years, even as tactics evolve

"At the most basic level, I would say that our product is our journalism, which we then marry with a really compelling and useful user experience, in a way that helps people really act on our journalism so that they can understand and engage with the world around them."  Tactical:  Marry core content with compelling UXFocus on helping users 'act' on the information provided    "We have the solar system metaphor where for us news is the sun in the sense that it's why we exist. It is what gives us our brand heritage and reputation. It's what instills trust. It's also where we just have the largest audience when you think about a funnel for our portfolio, and it's also where we just have the most amount of high quality coverage. But then that sun helps you give birth to other satellite planets or products that have a lot of the same DNA."  Tactical:  Identify the 'sun' product that drives brand heritage and trustBuild satellite products that share the core DNA of the primary productUse the primary product as the top-of-funnel for the rest of the portfolio    "One thing that's really interesting is that our impact and our business goals are in service of our mission, which is to seek the truth and help people understand the world, not the other way around. What it means is that the way that we think about impact is growing a giant subscription business. That business exists to strengthen an informed democracy."  Tactical:  Define business metrics as being 'in service' of the missionMeasure impact not just by revenue, but by mission-driven outcomes like policy changes

"Vision of the company. So when this company is successful, what does that look like?... What that might look like is a big venture outcome that we all read about. And if you are both assuming that you both think the same thing but aren't talking about it explicitly... then what often happens if you have differences is they come home to roost."  Tactical:  Ask: 'What is the vision for the company when it reaches its full potential?'Discuss the trade-offs inherent in different visions (e.g., lifestyle business vs. venture scale)

"You need coherence about where you're going and the way you get that is by creating a North Star for yourself. It should be in three to five years in the future, it should be very low resolution. It should describe a thing that every single person who reads it who has any kind of knowledge that might be useful or relevant agrees that it is plausible."  Tactical:  Set a 3-5 year vision that is 'low resolution' to allow for adaptation.Ensure the vision is plausible enough that experts across functions (legal, eng, etc.) can see how it could work.

"If we all agree that the feeling of something should be, I'm sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday, then people will just naturally build something that feels more consistent. You know what the iconography, the designers know what iconography should look like. You know what the communication and join pattern should look like."  Tactical:  Define the 'feeling' of the product using a relatable real-world analogy (e.g., 'sitting in a park' or 'face-to-face communication').Use these metaphors to ensure consistency across different teams without micromanaging every detail.    "For strategy to be useful, it actually has to change our behavior as a team to create better customer outcomes... What's the change, or coming out with a strategy that'll align people because we have the story, we have the narrative, we have the sequence."  Tactical:  Evaluate strategy by asking: 'What will we do differently tomorrow because of this?'Use narrative and sequence to align the team on the long-term path.

Annie Pearl 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Strategy is really just an integrated set of choices that outline how you're going to win in whatever marketplace you choose. And so, a good product strategy is going to answer questions like what's your winning aspiration? But maybe more importantly, where are you going to play? What are the markets you're going to go after? What are the segments of those markets? What are the personas in the segments of those markets? And then, how are you going to win with a target audience?"  Tactical:  Define the 'winning aspiration' first.Identify specific markets, segments, and personas to target.Articulate exactly how you will win with that target audience.

Tactical:  Focus on articulating a simple and compelling 'why' behind every major product decision.Act as a change agent for initiatives that are best for the long-term interest of the company, even if they are hard to execute.

"The easiest way to take over a great big market is to define a segment of the market that is underserved by the market leader... knocking over that pin enables us to get to the three pins right beside it. And so now I'm established here as a beachhead and I can go get the next three pins."  Tactical:  Identify a 'lead pin' segment that is underserved by the current market leader.Focus all resources on dominating that specific niche beachhead.Sequence expansion into adjacent segments once the initial niche is secured.

"You do want to look for at least two out of these three factors, inflection points here if you want to make a really good product. Number one is there a... Shift is a step function in the tech... The second factor that we should look for is, what is the consumer behavior shift?... And I'd say the third inflection point, particularly I would say in enterprise but also in consumer, is the business model shift."  Tactical:  Identify step-functions in technology (like LLMs or mobile) that enable new solutionsLook for changes in how consumers use existing tools (like using a camera as a keyboard)Evaluate if a new business model (like outcome-based monetization) is possible

"Cash App, as a team we really cared about what we could do that was different and better than what else existed in-market. Being different is not enough... Being better is not enough... It has to be better than what exists today in a way that matters to the end user"  Tactical:  Identify what exists in the market and intentionally build something else.Ensure the improvement is meaningful to the end user's experience.Avoid just making a 'better' version that costs more without unique value.

"The technical architecture determines strategy in a technology company even more than the what and who we're building for. If you build the right technical how and set yourself up to have a platform that can be adaptable, flexible, that is incredibly valuable over the long term."  Tactical:  Evaluate product roadmaps based on whether the technical foundation allows for future adaptability.Involve senior leadership in deep technical reviews to ensure architecture aligns with a 100-year vision.

"The second one is Good Strategy Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt. Just thinking about in a very clear way, how do you build product? It's one of the best strategy books I've read and strategy is a hard word to even think about in many ways."

"Lyft's vision was always anchored around transportation, people of transportation... Uber had... this notion of being a logistics platform for assets in the world, for transporting people, for transporting things... I think Uber was able to rebound much more quickly because of how diversified the business was."  Tactical:  Evaluate if your vision is anchored to a specific use case or a broader capability (e.g., 'moving people' vs. 'logistics').Consider how a more diversified vision allows for pivoting into adjacent categories (like food delivery) during crises.

You need to get that idea out of your head and present it to someone in a visual form that helps you talk about and communicate about it."

"Product strategy sits between the mission and vision and the plan... It forces choice to deploy scarce resources to generate maximum impact."  Tactical:  Position strategy between the mission/vision and the roadmapFocus on achieving 'resonance' between the product and the market    "What does the product look like in five to 10 years? Why is the world better in 10 years? And what is the most exciting version of that view?"  Tactical:  Ask leaders to describe a 'day in the life' of a user 5-10 years in the futureCluster long-term ideas into three distinct, cohesive versions of the futureCreate 'concept cars' or prototypes to inspire the team without the intent of immediate commercialization    "I want you to imagine the progress on all these strategic pillars and what the headline of that newspaper article looks like. It's called a newspaper headline approach."  Tactical:  Have every team member write a mock newspaper headline for the product 2 years outUse a 'blender' approach to combine common themes from these headlines into a single winning aspiration

"if you think about strategy as a strongly held hypothesis about a way to win in the market and fulfill our vision, then you can say, "Well, our mission is this, or vision..." ... Strategy answers those questions. They say, "We're going to have a game. It's going to be an Apple Arcade. We have a hypothesis that's actually going to help us.""  Tactical:  Define strategy as the specific choices (platform, business model, target) made to fulfill the mission.Ensure the quarterly objective is a direct step toward the strategic hypothesis.    "the product manager serves the business. That's their role... they need to understand business models, they need to understand how to do a target market, and what is a target market, why is that target market the right one to go after, and how is it going to grow"  Tactical:  Deeply study business models (subscriptions vs. one-off sales) to understand how the company survives.Focus on target market selection and growth trends as core PM responsibilities.

Tactical:  Share the mission and vision at every all-hands meetingEnsure every team member can succinctly explain why the product exists    "Imagine a world where someone can feel this way about their money.'

"It is only a tarpit if it seems like it's not. If it's just a regular idea that is hard, that is not a tarpit. The weird aspect of what we call a tarpit idea is an idea that a lot of people come up with and then it seems like an unsolved problem and you get lots of positive feedback for. Right? And you have a really good set of arguments that it's a really good startup idea. And that's different than a bad startup idea."  Tactical:  Be skeptical of ideas that receive easy, polite validation but have a history of failure (e.g., friend coordination apps)Look for structural reasons why an 'obvious' problem remains unsolved before committing to it

"I think for us we had a framing of, we're going to go trace a workflow. If you've got an idea, go express it through Slides or hop in FigJam and brainstorm with your team. Okay, what's next? Go design, hop in Figma Design. If you need to go to development after that, Dev Mode will help you take you there."  Tactical:  Identify gaps in the user's journey from idea to finished productCreate separate product surfaces for distinct stages of the workflow (e.g., brainstorming vs. high-fidelity design)    "You have to go from strength to strength, and you can't always just be obsessed with what's the next biggest TAM... we looked to the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the start of Figma, and it was like 250,000 designers in the world was what it said. Probably wrong at the time, but also it was a point in time and the industry is about to change."

Evan LaPointe 1 quote

"Your brain is going to sort those ideas into believed, believable, kind of conceivable and inconceivable... A lot of the vision thinking and dialogue that happens inside of businesses directly activates people's inconceivable response without any self-awareness that, that's a personal problem, not a objective problem."  Tactical:  Recognize your own 'unbelievable' threshold and when your brain is rejecting an idea based on personality rather than logic.Translate visionary ideas into 'believable' language for stakeholders who are high in conscientiousness and low in openness.

"To invent systematically, first you do need to be somewhat of an expert in whatever area you want to invent... then the second thing people don't do is they don't spend dedicated time actually thinking. They feel like, 'Invention is just going to come to me.' When I want to invent, I get away from all my devices. I go in a room with the problem I have, and I force myself to actually concentrate on what do I know and how can I invent?"  Tactical:  Block off two hours of dedicated thinking time at least once a monthRemove all digital devices to ensure deep concentration on a specific problemTry combining two existing, unrelated concepts to generate a new invention

"The job is to delight customers. Like Peter Thiel, his book, From Zero to One. The job of an entrepreneur at the beginning is just to find out something that's 10X better. Delight is trying to work in that magnitude."

"Power requires a benefit and a barrier, so he's taking care of the benefit part by saying a castle, you have to have a pretty good understanding of why it's a castle and not a shack."  Tactical:  Evaluate your product strategy using the 'Benefit and Barrier' test to ensure long-term value.    "Strategy is a long time concept. You're looking far out in the future... if you focus on value that narrows what you think about and allows you to get rather concise and offer up advice to founders about what they need to pay attention to."  Tactical:  Narrow your strategic focus to the factors that drive long-term business value rather than short-term tactical wins.

"At our scale we got to hunt for bigger elephants. And so I think at any scale as a PM, whatever your idea is or whatever your solution or the problem you're solving, take a minute at the beginning to say, could this be bigger? Could this be a bigger thing and more impactful than the initial idea, even if the initial idea sounds big?"  Tactical:  Ask 'could this be bigger?' at the start of every projectStart with a large vision even if you begin execution with a small step    "Most people operate within a box... take that really wide view of what product is across disciplines... take that really wide view of what success for your product is and not have the blinders on its product or tech. It's anything. It's anything that influences the success and your customers' success."  Tactical:  Identify and knock down constraints regardless of which department owns themThink like an owner of the entire business, not just the technical feature

"Our realization is actually let's hide our vision, which is everybody can create their software in the form factor that people do care. So what kind of tool do people use every day? Productivity software. It took us two years to realize we need to build a productivity tool. We called it sugar-coated broccoli. People don't want to eat the broccoli but people like sugar, so it gave them the sugar then hide your broccoli inside of it."  Tactical:  Identify the 'sugar' (the immediate utility users want) to deliver the 'broccoli' (your deeper vision/technology).Avoid building purely for your own values if it results in a product that the mass market doesn't care about.    "Building for something you want the world to have is building for your value. You have some taste. You have some aesthetic. There are different energy. You need to create a balance. Too much of yourself. Then there's no users. Then you're just doing our project. And too much for business, you're building a commodity."  Tactical:  Audit your product to see if it leans too heavily toward personal aesthetic or pure business optimization.Use personal values as a durable energy source during difficult building periods.    "We ship non-Lego pieces into our product. We're still there. We're still cleaning up part of it. That's a realization. It's like going back to the value part, it's like if you create this thing called a product or business, you attract people are value aligned to it. Then if you're trying to optimize too much on this competition revenue side of things, forced to introducing something anti-your-value, then the system, it's like there's organ rejection with your employees, with your customers."  Tactical:  Ensure new features align with the product's fundamental 'abstraction' (e.g., building blocks vs. hard-coded features).Be willing to spend more time building a modular solution rather than a quick, hard-coded fix.

"I basically realized that there's three key components to strategy... Vision: This is your inspiring picture of what the future looks like... Strategic framework: This is where you're saying, 'Here is the market we're going after. Here's what success looks like. And here are our big bets on what we think it takes to win that market.'... And then the third part is the roadmap."  Tactical:  Define 'big bets' that explain how you will win your target marketEnsure the vision is an 'inspiring picture' that motivates the team    "I think a good strategy is all about connecting the dots. Connecting the dots from this high level business goal of, 'We want to increase revenue by this much' to, 'This is the feature we're going to do.' And it might have many, many dots in between to help get people from one to the other."  Tactical:  Map every feature back to a specific business goal (e.g., revenue targets)Identify the 'missing dots' or assumptions in the logic between a goal and a feature    "One of the great ways to learn strategy is to cross apply strategy from other places... consistency versus comprehensiveness. They said 'Is our product the kind of product where it's better to have consistent results all the time... or is it better to have comprehensiveness where even though the experience will be different each time we give you a result every time?'"  Tactical:  Look for 'eigenquestions' (like consistency vs. comprehensiveness) used by other successful productsStudy how leaders in different industries frame their trade-offs

And then say, unlike this alternative our product, and then say what this statement of differentiation is."

It's like, we could do this right now, it's okay. 10 years from now, what could San Francisco look like? Or some city? What happens to the parking spaces? Are there still parking garages? Are those parks now?"  Tactical:  Carve out distraction-free time to visualize the industry 5-10 years outIdentify specific physical or societal changes that will likely occur (e.g., repurposed parking spaces)    "One example might be, why do we need a 4,000 pound vehicle to move a human three miles? Okay, well... Or even a couple of humans. We do an Uber Pool or a Share, and you move two humans or three humans, even then that's pretty inefficient. If you think about just the physics there, the energy expenditure."

Tactical:  Score the current solution's efficiency from 1 to 10.Score your proposed product's efficiency from 1 to 10.Ensure the delta is at least 4 to guarantee high user tolerance and low CAC.Identify the 'Unique Brag-worthy Proposition' (UBP) that triggers word-of-mouth.

"I really like to start by just imagining what is the future that you actually want Right now? I have a wall in my house in my office, which is my vision for what I'd like the world to look like in 2050."  Tactical:  Create a physical or digital 'vision wall' for a long-term horizon (e.g., 2050)Define 'wild success' and 'terrible failure' for a 10-year period to clarify the desired direction    "So we have this concept of chaos to clarity. Every idea starts in the chaos side, and then you have to work all the way to the other side, which is clarity. That very first step at the far end of chaos was quite an embarrassing step actually, because you don't have mastery at that point."  Tactical:  Start by simply writing an idea down to move it out of your headUse pitch decks to refine and communicate thinking before buildingAccept that the first step of a vision will feel 'embarrassing' due to a lack of mastery    "So our mission, empower world design, empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every language on every device, and just take those things very literally."

"I once asked all the executive team at a healthcare company, what's the vision for this company? And they said, to be the backbone of healthcare. And I said, what does that mean? And they couldn't elaborate. Nobody could elaborate on that. And I said, cool, that's a tagline, but it's not a vision."  Tactical:  Ask leaders to elaborate on vague vision statements to see if they have a shared understanding of the future state.Define who the future customers will be and how the value provided will differ from today.    "A vision should be concrete enough where people can picture what it will be in their head. It can't be a fluffy... be the backbone of healthcare. What does that mean? I don't get it. So people need to be able to look at a vision and say, I can understand that we're going to get there one day."  Tactical:  Ensure the vision is far enough away that it cannot be achieved by building just one thing.Avoid making the vision a description of the current state of the product.    "I love reading a vision that's like, we're not going to be like that. And that, to me, is so powerful because you're like, oh, okay, we're not going to copy that. We're not going to go after that."

"Our goal with Cursor is to invent sort of a new type of programming, a very different way to build software, that's kind of just distilled down into you describing the intent to the computer for what you want in the most concise way possible, and really distilled down to just defining how you think the software should work, and how you think it should look."  Tactical:  Focus on the 'what' (logic and intent) rather than the 'how' (under-the-hood implementation).Aim for a representation of logic that is human-readable and human-editable, moving toward pseudocode.    "I think that more and more, being an engineer will start to feel like being a logic designer, and really, it will be about specifying your intent for how exactly you want everything to work. It'd be more about the whats, and a little bit less about how exactly you're going to do things under the hood."  Tactical:  Develop 'taste' for how software should work and look as a primary competitive advantage.

Because the reality of the product development cycle is that it's so messy, it's so chaotic... it's so important to be anchored on that singular vision because then any step along the way feels like forward progress."  Tactical:  Ensure vision is inseparable from user research and team input rather than created in a vacuumRoot the vision in engineering feasibility from the beginningUse a 'pain point, solution, proof point' structure for vision pitches    "I think that when you're actually presenting a vision, one of the most important things is that there is a single artifact that the team is creating together... you want for everyone to feel incredible ownership and incredible passion about this combined deliverable, so that it's a unified team who believes a singular set of insights."

We haven't built Windows yet, and it will be obvious once we do. ...

And to put that in context, that means figuring out how to move money instantly. That means figuring out how to drop the price all the way from six all the way down to 0.35."  Tactical:  Set the product bar at 'blowing the user's socks off' rather than just functional utilityIdentify the 'theoretical minimum' cost or 'theoretical maximum' speed and aim for that as the long-term goalAvoid shortcuts that rely on existing infrastructure if they prevent you from fundamentally changing the user experience

"A strategy is a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge. It's a mixture of policy and action designed to deal with a challenge."  Tactical:  Define strategy as a mixture of policy and action to address a specific challenge.    "The kernel... if anyone in three is missing, something's wrong. It's not really a strategy, it's something else. There has to be an understanding of the situation. There has to be a guiding policy, how are we going to deal with it? And then the coherence and action is critical."  Tactical:  Ensure your strategy document includes a clear diagnosis of the situation.Develop a guiding policy that outlines the approach to the diagnosis.List coherent actions that implement the policy without contradicting each other.    "Don't call it strategy, call it an action agenda. It's huge numbers of people out there willing to sell you advice on mission and your vision and your values... That's not true. Begin to try to identify the one or two key challenges that can actually be addressed and what are we going to do about it?"

They're taking away the friction of finding a driver. In economics, we call those things transaction costs."  Tactical:  Identify the specific market failure or friction (e.g., trust, discovery, payment) that your platform is uniquely positioned to solve.    "Maybe we shouldn't talk about the concept of a marketplace founder. Really there's founders. And I think every entrepreneur... it means literally any founder is a marketplace founder. It'll be a choice they make after they grow as to whether they want to build a platform."

"The product strategy stack is a system that helps people understand what framework they're using in order to make decisions and what's going to drive value for the business. The top of the stack is the company mission... The second thing is strategy... The next level of the strategy stack is the product strategy. And the product strategy is the connective tissue between what is the company trying to accomplish and what are the day-to-day things that the product team is doing."  Tactical:  Define the mission as the qualitative, aspirational change you want to bring to the world.Ensure the strategy is 'rigorously logical' rather than just aspirational.Use the stack to debug issues: if goals aren't being met, check if the roadmap or strategy is misaligned.    "One of the things that we said with stake that we put in the ground was the strategy doc wouldn't be complete without wireframes... the reason is that oftentimes when you talk about strategy in words alone, everyone takes away a different interpretation of that strategy, whereas when you actually can show people wireframes of what the product will look like when that strategy is implemented, it creates much more alignment."  Tactical:  Include conceptual wireframes in strategy documents to force concrete decisions about trade-offs.Use the 'nav bar test': if your strategy doesn't dictate what the 4-5 items on a mobile nav bar are, it isn't specific enough.

"Choose your customers, choose your future. Choose your competition and choose your future. Choose the source of validation and you choose your future. Choose your distribution, and you're also choosing your future."  Tactical:  Explicitly select a 'smallest viable audience' rather than trying to appeal to everyone.Align the product's distribution strategy with the specific needs and behaviors of the chosen customer base.

"Google taught me the... power of thinking really big. And I know it sounds like a platitude, but really big. And I only actually realized that when I left Google and I started working with the other teams and these were all capable teams and I was struck by how many teams just limited the potential of what they could achieve."  Tactical:  Ask 'What does it take to make it bigger?' for every $1M or $10M opportunity.Be willing to let go of smaller opportunities to focus on billion-dollar potential.    "Most execution problems that I encounter in a high performing environment where everybody has the right intentions are actually not execution problems, they are either strategy problems or interpersonal problems or cultural problems."  Tactical:  If a 'band-aid' solution like a new review process fails, investigate if the teams are pursuing different or undefined strategies.    "Twitter's biggest problem is a product strategy problem. The reason they're struggling is they don't have a real product strategy. Now, of course, attempts were made to create a product strategy, but it wasn't a real compelling, cohesive product strategy."  Tactical:  Distinguish between 'fake' strategy and a 'real compelling, cohesive' strategy.Recognize that execution alone cannot fix a fundamental lack of strategic direction.

"In terms of the product, whether you're working for a big company or a startup, the core product management tenant is still the same, which is, you have to work backwards from the customer problem or the user problem. Building a technology for the sake of it doesn't really go that far, so you really have to focus on the, what are you building, who are you building it for and what problem are you solving?"  Tactical:  Focus on the 'who' and the 'what problem' before the 'how' of the technology.

"To really set the new purpose for it, which was this is not a springboard for other products, this is not a traffic jumpstart for, it's not an app self feed, it's really about people that matter talking about things that I care about professionally. It's about knowledge exchange."  Tactical:  Shift product DNA from 'activity tracking' to 'value exchange' or 'knowledge sharing'.Define the vision by asking: 'If you're successful, what change would happen in the world?'

Invest profits and not people"  Tactical:  Avoid moving core team members to experimental secondary productsFund new ventures with profits or venture capital, not by thinning out the core engineering team    "This design driven initiative was really about how can we think about the system architecture of our product? What are the key building blocks of Mixpanel? Where do they need to fit? How few of them can we have, which is a really important step?"  Tactical:  Identify the core building blocks of the product (e.g., pages and blocks in Notion)Optimize for the fewest number of building blocks possible to increase feature reach and consistency

And as a result, the state of the world where we're trying to be. It's very simplistic, but in its simplicity of the magic because you are like, 'I'm a PM, I'm trying to solve problems.'"  Tactical:  Use the 'Once upon a time' framework: Once upon a time [problem], then one day [event/launch], and because of that [change], and finally [new state of the world]    "I write an article. I'll write in the headline because if the vision has come to pass, right? And it's gone well, someone's going to be writing hopefully some sexy headline about the thing that you've built. So I go to the future and I write the headline I would see. And I write the subtitle, just that, and I'll actually use the... I'll [inaudible 00:18:01] it into the page of TechCrunch or [inaudible 00:18:04] or something just so it looks realistic."  Tactical:  Write a future TechCrunch or New York Times headline and subtitle for your productMock the headline into a realistic-looking news page to provoke a response and build conviction    "I actually took a screenshot of the Google Play Store... and then I created rounded rectangles, just blank rectangles, four panels.

"I really like the vision mission strategy pyramid... At the top is vision. Below it is mission and strategy, and then objectives. And this is a very simple framework... where do you need to go long term? In 10 years, if you could zoom up and look at what an ideal path for you would be, what is that? Write it down."  Tactical:  Define a 10-year vision as the top level of abstractionEnsure each level of the pyramid (Mission, Strategy, Objectives) ladders up to the Vision    "I would pre-fill out the Miro beforehand... create them as headers in the Miro document... give everyone the space and the freedom to think existential and to frame it that way, 'we are going to be thinking in a five to 10 year timeline. Do not worry about what's happening today.'"  Tactical:  Pre-fill whiteboarding tools (Miro/FigJam) with headers and prompts before the meetingUse timers and music to facilitate focused, creative brainstormingSynthesize ideas into buckets after the meeting rather than forcing a final vision in the room

"The thing that I learned from him was intentionality... You got to have intentionality. Where do you want to go? What is the world you want to create for your customers? And then create out A/B testing to get you the fastest route to that end state world."  Tactical:  Define the 'intentionality' of the product before setting up testsUse A/B testing as a GPS to find the fastest route to a pre-defined destination, not to choose the destination    "What Brian taught us was think unconstrained first. Think about a 15 out of 10 experience, design the ideal end state first. In most companies, the designers and PM start by saying, 'Okay, 10 is perfect. We can probably do seven. Let's start at seven.' It's a very constrained minded thinking."  Tactical:  Design the perfect, unconstrained experience first, then work backwards to what is feasibleDo things that don't scale in one location to prove the 'lovable' product before scaling

"I talk about look in the future and then think backwards a lot, right? It's like what would we want to have done 20 years ago on this? We have very long-term plans. At 100 years you can't talk about this software project but you can talk about the mission itself, whatever things that will survive for 80 years that are left on this particular timeframe."  Tactical:  Look decades into the future and work backwards to current decisionsFocus the long-term vision on the mission (e.g., entrepreneurship) rather than the toolAsk: 'What is the decision our future selves would want us to make?'    "The positional game is like, what is the territory on the map that you are taking? What role do you play? How much trust do you have of merchants? Do merchants want more from you or less? Are you the kind of thing they're trying to optimize out of their software spend, or the one that they ask to subsume all other software spend? ... If you do that well, the tactics are yours."  Tactical:  Prioritize the 'positional game' (trust, role, territory) over short-term 'tactics' (hacks, A/B tests)Avoid 'tacticking' yourself out of a position by over-extracting value from customersFocus on being the partner customers want to rely on more deeply over time
