Cross-functional Collaboration  Cross-functional collaboration is the art of getting engineers, designers, researchers, and go-to-market teams to build together rather than in sequence. The best product teams dissolve the handoffs between roles, build shared context through direct exposure to customers, and treat collaboration itself as a product to be designed.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 57 experts.

1 Involve engineering in discovery, not just delivery  The biggest collaboration mistake is treating engineers as implementers who receive specs. Bring your tech lead to customer calls, include engineers in research synthesis, and let them hear problems directly. When engineers understand the 'why,' they design better solutions and become co-creators rather than order-takers.

Featured guest perspectives

"Early on, we started bringing in engineers to customer meetings more and more... it's so simple and it's so effective. When we started doing it, the response from the engineering team was great."

— Christine Itwaru    "The trio is the product manager, the designer, and the software engineer. If you've never worked in a well-functioning trio, this breaks people's brains, because they say, 'Well, what are we going to do when we disagree?' You're going to find an option where you don't disagree."

— Teresa Torres    "When you take the people that are part of the project team out of the creative loop entirely, they're going to find that creative outlet somewhere else and it's actually kind of bad for the product."

— Camille Fournier        2 Define roles through mutual expectations, not job descriptions  Friction happens when PM, design, and engineering each assume the others will handle something. Sit down with your cross-functional partners and write out what you expect from them—then have them do the same for you. This exercise reveals gaps and overlaps before they become problems.

Featured guest perspectives

"The exercise that I often do is I have them sit down and write expectations for each other... I as a product manager write what I think my role is and also what my expectations of my counterparts are, and they do the same, and then we review it together."

— Nikita Miller    "Make sure you go somewhere where you have a good engineering partner... it's really important that you're aligned. You understand your roles and responsibilities and where you're going to divide and conquer."

— Tamar Yehoshua        3 Be the bridge between builders and sellers  Product lives at the intersection of what you can build and what you can sell. Your job is connecting engineering with sales, design with marketing, research with customer success. When these functions operate in silos, you build things nobody can sell or sell things you can't build.

Featured guest perspectives

"If I've got product, marketing, and sales together in the room working on defining what our differentiated value is, then I'm going to get all the good juice out of the product team... and also the juice from the sales team that understands what the common objections are."

— April Dunford    "You're taking the building side of the organization and the selling side of the organization and bringing it together... it's the PM in the middle, and then you have engineering, product design, and then sales, marketing, product management on the other side."

— Nan Yu        4 Share credit generously and publicly  Nothing destroys collaboration faster than a PM who hogs the spotlight. When the feature ships, let engineers present their work. When you get praised, redirect to the team. This isn't just good manners—it builds the trust that makes people want to work with you again.

Featured guest perspectives

"Engineers sometimes think that they don't get the credit for their work because the PM takes all the glory... making every effort to be credit sharing and inclusive of the engineering team and giving them the opportunity to speak about their contributions."

— Camille Fournier    "Do you know your engineering manager's birthday? It's the day they showed up in the world. It's the most important day for them... Do you know their work anniversary?"

— Ebi Atawodi        5 Connect directly, don't play telephone  When stakeholders need technical details, connect them directly to engineers. When engineers need customer context, bring them to the customer. Playing middle-person wastes time, introduces translation errors, and makes you a bottleneck. Your value is orchestration, not mediation.

Featured guest perspectives

"If you are being asked questions that you cannot answer because you just don't know or because that's something that involves a level of technical detail that only the engineers have... I think that is very annoying and frankly, it's a waste of time for everyone."

— Camille Fournier    "Product manager needs unencumbered access to the engineers. If you're not working every day with a set of engineers on solving problems, you are not a product manager."

— Marty Cagan

✗ Common Mistakes

Using engineers as implementation resources rather than creative partnersHoarding information instead of creating direct connections between stakeholdersTaking credit for team wins or failing to redirect praiseTreating design as a service function that delivers pixels on requestAssuming other functions understand your constraints without explicit conversation     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Engineers proactively suggest product improvements and identify opportunitiesYour design and engineering partners want to work with you on future projectsCross-functional disagreements get resolved by finding better options, not pulling rankStakeholders go directly to the right expert without routing everything through youOther functions describe you as collaborative rather than demanding

"Cross-functional missions at the Times... include a lot of the same skill sets that you would find at a tech company, PMs, engineers, designers, data scientists, researchers, product marketers. But the big difference is we also have editors, if it's a product space that directly shapes our journalism."  Tactical:  Embed subject matter experts (editors) within product missionsEnsure editors have a 'product-minded' perspective    "Product managers at the Times really need to understand the blend of art and science. They really need to value expert editorial judgment as they're also looking at individual KPIs, customer research and insights, et cetera."  Tactical:  Value expert editorial judgment alongside dataBalance the 'art' of the product with the 'science' of metrics

"Our designers... have an entire vibe coded side prototype of the Codex app... if we like it, they'll vibe engineer that prototype into an actual PR to land. And then depending on their comfort with the code base... they'll land it themselves or they'll get close and then an engineer can help them land the PR."  Tactical:  Enable designers to build functional prototypes using AI agentsCreate a workflow where non-engineers can submit PRs that engineers then 'polish' or validate

"If you approach it with that "Yes, and...", it's often still true. It's like, oh, both of these things can be true at once. You could have a different goal than I have, or you have a system problem local to you that is important to you and it's not important to me. That's okay, both things can exist. So, now that we accept both and can work off of each other, we're more likely to build both a better rapport and energy among ourselves because we're not just saying, "No, no, no, no, you're wrong.""  Tactical:  Acknowledge that conflicting goals between teams can both be validAvoid flat denials of other teams' perspectives to maintain rapport and progress    "If you are CMO and your product leader aren't married at the hip, you're just missing out on just tons of opportunity, and the likelihood of things actually working very well consistently and compounding on each other."  Tactical:  Ensure marketing leadership and product leadership are 'married at the hip' in planning and executionTreat product and marketing as one integrated system rather than two different things    "Honestly, I think learn product development. Go learn agile product development... understanding those skills and those systems will, one, I think make you think differently about how to run your marketing team and, two, make you exponentially better at working with your product organization."  Tactical:  Take courses in product-led growth or agile developmentApply product development cycles (sprints) to marketing initiatives

"Personal Operating Manual. And it helps prompt you to talk about working style together... What communication style do you like the best? How do you like to work? Do you like large uninterrupted blocks? Do you like meetings here and there? When I'm trying to get a hold of you for something important, what's the best way to do that?"  Tactical:  Define your preferred communication channels for different levels of urgencyShare your 'pet peeves' and what earns a 'gold star' with youClarify your delegation style (e.g., 'check in weekly' vs. 'tell me when it's done')

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti + Kiriti Badam 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"A lot of old contracts and handoffs between traditional roles, like say PMs and engineers and data folks has now been broken and people are really getting adapted to this new way of working together and kind of owning the same feedback loop in a way. Because previously, I feel like PMs and engineers and all of these folks had their own feedback loops to optimize. And now you need to be probably sitting in the same room. You're probably looking at agent traces together."  Tactical:  Have PMs and engineers review agent traces together to decide on desired product behavior.Unify feedback loops across functions to optimize for the same end-user outcome.

"One of the things that I think is sort of hard about tech companies is these silos between designers, product managers, and engineers... the common language that everyone shares is code. Ultimately in software tech companies, everything that we're talking about need to eventually flush out in terms of code. And so what if the language becomes actually working prototypes and working applications?"  Tactical:  Use tools that translate design (like Figma) directly into code to reduce handoff friction.Communicate product ideas through functional prototypes rather than static mocks or text documents.    "You got to be fluid because again, when designers can code and engineers can design, I mean it really becomes, you can't have a lot of structure around that. So you want to build a culture and you want to build an environment or milieu that is really, really flexible, which is uncomfortable for a lot of people."  Tactical:  Encourage designers to attend engineering reviews and vice versa.Hire for 'design-engineers' who can operate across the full product spectrum.

"I've certainly seen organizations or been in organizations where the product team doesn't necessarily want to be bothered by sales, but I sort of flip that on the head and say sales and sort of the go-to-market teams in general could be your biggest asset to helping you get your job done well."  Tactical:  Spend time in the field with sales to understand the 'why' behind customer requests.Use sales feedback to identify solutions that solve problems for a broad swath of customers rather than building one-off requests.

"If I've got product, marketing, and sales together in the room working on defining what our differentiated value is, then I'm going to get all the good juice out of the product team that deeply understands the product... and then I'm also going to have all the juice from the sales team that understands what the common objections are."  Tactical:  Form a cross-functional team to define differentiated value.Ensure product teams share the 'why' behind features with the sales team.Use sales' frontline experience to identify the most common customer objections during the positioning process.

Asha Sharma 1 quote

"I really believe in the concept of the full stack builder... I think it's all about the loop, not the lane here. And so I think that whatever function you are, you have to be obsessed with trying to understand the efficiency or the cost of the product, the actual rewards or system design that you're going after, the actual UI, UX."  Tactical:  Encourage PMs, engineers, and designers to understand the full 'loop' of the product, including system design and costMinimize handoffs between functions to maintain high metabolism and throughput

"It's intentionally meant to be almost at odds, and that's part of the structure of how we want to work. ... It might be, 'Hey, we're going to move the button. Hey let's run the test,' but see the short-term lift. You know we're going to monitor it long term. You know when we ship it, it's going to be high quality, high quality polish. And you trust us to make those trade-offs."  Tactical:  Allow Growth teams to experiment on core surfaces provided they adhere to established quality and polish standards.Use long-term monitoring as a 'safety net' to resolve disagreements between short-term metric gains and long-term product integrity.

Bob Baxley 2 quotes

"I think that design is most successful at impacting what ships at the end if design is considered phase zero of the engineering process, rather than a by product or a part of the product process."  Tactical:  Identify 'creative technologists' in engineering who can sit with the ambiguity of early-stage design discussions.    "I'm like, you guys tell us what you need us to do, what the features need to be, when they need to be delivered, what the issues are, and then give us the time and space to come up with a solution to those problems."  Tactical:  Respect functional boundaries: PMs drive the roadmap, Designers drive the UI solution.

"For us, product managers are really connectives. They connect the team, ideas, data, a whole bunch of different things, and it's very messy. There's no exact recipe for how to do it, but connecting these disparate areas and moving the team and the technology and our customers to a new place, a new vision is essentially what product managers do"  Tactical:  Focus on reorienting the team around new constraints as they arise weeklyBridge the gap between marketing timelines and engineering shipping dates

"Engineers sometimes think that they don't get the credit for their work because the PM takes all the glory and all the credit for the project that they really worked very hard on, right? So making every effort to be credit sharing and inclusive of the engineering team and giving them the opportunity to speak about their contributions when it makes sense."  Tactical:  Share credit explicitly with the engineering teamGive engineers the opportunity to speak about their contributions to executives or customers    "When you act like they don't matter and you don't care about them and it's just like, I don't care, just like tell me when you can get this done or why is it going to take so long? My god, this just seems like such a little thing. It just shows a real lack of empathy for the work that engineers are doing and I think it really can be very off-putting."  Tactical:  Show respect for the complexity of engineering work even if you don't understand every detailBe patient when engineers explain technical constraints    "If you are being asked questions that you cannot answer because you just don't know or because that's something that involves a level of technical detail that only the engineers have... and you put yourself in this in-between position... I think that is very annoying and frankly, it's a waste of time for everyone."  Tactical:  Connect stakeholders directly to engineers when technical depth is requiredAvoid defaulting to 'let me get back to you' if it happens too frequently    "When you take the people that are part of the project team out of the creative loop entirely, they're going to find that creative outlet somewhere else and it's actually kind of bad for the product."  Tactical:  Involve engineers in the creative loop and product discoveryDon't hoard all the product ideas for yourself

Dylan Field 2 quotes

"The best PMs, I think again, create those frameworks that bring everyone else along and those frameworks also have a point of view and a strategy associated with them. So you're able to take the strategy, take the point of view, wrap it all up in a framework, and then make it so that everyone knows what the destination is and how to get there."  Tactical:  Develop a point of view and strategy before attempting to align the teamWrap strategy into a framework that clearly defines the 'destination' for all functions    "The trend that we've been seeing for the past five years is the trend that is going to accelerate in the next five years, and that's a shift in emerging of roles... We're all product builders and some of us are specialized in our particular area."  Tactical:  Encourage non-designers to engage in design tasks like prototyping or brand explorationHire for 'high judgment' and generalist abilities alongside deep specialization

"It's like how do you get the marketing to product handoff right? And if it means you have someone that owns onboarding, it's in a hybrid role, then great. If it means there's a committee sort of situation with one person at the DRI, that's great too. So I think my answer is, I don't think there's one way to structure it, it's just highly dependent on the company overall. And I think you need both skill sets."  Tactical:  Ensure the signup flow and onboarding experience feel consistent with the marketing messaging.Coordinate transactional product emails with marketing drip campaigns to avoid overwhelming the user.

"We'll first design something without even having any idea of what or why we're doing it, but we'll design a bunch of different things and then we'll sit down with the PMs and look at the designs and just go over one and the next."  Tactical:  Try 'Design-first' sessions where designers explore visual possibilities before a formal spec is written.Have PMs and Designers review visual explorations together to spark new roadmap ideas based on what is visually possible.

"One of the biggest things we've been tweaking is like how do we do more of a tech spike at the beginning to be like, 'Do we have a good sense of how difficult this is going to be? The unknowns? ... another problem could be like, 'Hey, it's just so difficult to work with cross-functional partners and doing a little tweak in the process where you bring them in a kickoff meeting.'"  Tactical:  Run tech spikes early to identify technical unknowns and difficultyUse kickoff meetings to align cross-functional partners and improve team dynamicsAdjust collaboration processes based on the specific friction points of the team

"Performance marketing and brand marketing in a lot of organizations are two different things. And the designers that occupy brand teams bandwidth and whatnot often don't have a sense of how paid acquisition works. And so one of the pitfalls of working with certain companies or the mistake that they make is the design team will hand off a file full of random assets for paid acquisition without any sense of how the channel works."  Tactical:  Ensure design teams understand the specific requirements of paid acquisition channelsCreate a feedback loop where performance data drives creative iteration

Judd Antin 1 quote

"The solution is simple but not easy to me. It's that we need to restructure the way we make products in a way which integrates research much more fully. It looks like consistent relationships in which researchers, and the work, and the insights they provide are a part of the process from beginning to end."  Tactical:  Integrate researchers into a unified, lean product process from the start.Move away from treating research as a 'service discipline' that only validates finished designs.

"We need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles... we can drop all of these different role distinctions and call ourselves builders. I think that's sort of the most general purpose way of thinking about what we can all be."  Tactical:  Encourage team members to use AI to supplement skills outside their core discipline (e.g., engineers doing data analysis).

Katie Dill 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We have design and engineering and our product partners and product marketing work really, really closely on this. Actually, it's one of the few teams where all of these things report, well, not all of them, but most of those functions report into one place. So, engineering and design actually all report up into the design organization when they work on the website. Together, quite literally, as we were talking about earlier, if we were physically together, they would be sitting side by side and they're batting ideas back and forth."  Tactical:  Have engineers and designers sit side-by-side to enable rapid iteration cyclesConsider unified reporting lines for high-craft surfaces like the company website

Kayvon Beykpour 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"One of my biggest points of feedback and points of consternation was the structure of the company in that we had a functional organizational model... the combination of that model and the type of leader that Jack was wasn't working in my view. I think if you're going to have a functional organization, you need to have a GM or a CEO who's extremely leaned-in to tiebreak and resolve conflict."  Tactical:  If using a functional model, ensure there is a clear, 'leaned-in' tiebreaker to prevent consensus-driven stagnation.

Ken Norton 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"The people side of this is such an incredible aspect of what product management is. What I find... is people realizing that when they're put in a position where they're expected to have impact and realizing that they haven't developed the skills, they haven't developed the capability to actually be able to manage and work through all these people."

Karri Saarinen 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I think a lot of that, this craft for us happens when we give the project team this ownership and the project team is just engineering and design. Then, when they start building that feature they start seeing these opportunities that this thing could be better."  Tactical:  Form project teams consisting only of engineering and design to increase ownership.Empower engineers to identify and fix UX 'paper cuts' during the implementation phase.    "Yes, for every project there's a project lead. That lead can be engineer or designer. It's not a formal role or it's not based on your whatever level... It's more like an assignment that now you are responsible getting the project started and working together with the team, figuring it out, and then communicating changes or communicating how that progress happens."  Tactical:  Assign a 'Project Lead' for every initiative, regardless of whether they are an engineer or designer.Task the lead with scoping, progress communication, and cross-functional alignment.

"PM should be doing everything in their power to draw the perimeter of the space, of the problem space. And it's within that, eng, design, everyone else that you're working with, they can go as crazy as they want, push up against the bounds and it's fill the box to its maximum capacity."  Tactical:  Apply as many reasonable constraints as possible to remove unnecessary decisions for the team.Embrace 'murky overlaps' between roles rather than strict, siloed swim lanes.

"You're taking the building side of the organization and the selling side of the organization and bringing it together. You're taking all of the commercial motivations and goals of the company and making sure that what you build actually solves for those goals... it's the PM in the middle, and then you have engineering, product design, and then sales, marketing, product management on the other side."  Tactical:  Act as the connective tissue between commercial goals and technical possibilities.Ensure the product team understands the 'native language' of the customer to help marketing and sales.

"The exercise that I often do is I generally have an idea of what I think the roles and responsibilities are and the expectations across these four roles, but the exercise especially with leaders in an org is to have them sit down and write them for each other."  Tactical:  Have PM, Design, Engineering, and Data leaders write down expectations for their counterpartsCreate a 'contract' between roles to clarify shared responsibilitiesRevisit these definitions every 3-6 months or when execution friction arises    "I as a product manager, I write what I think my role is and also what I think what my expectations of my counterparts are and they do the same, and then we review it together."  Tactical:  Differentiate between IC expectations and manager expectations within the triadIdentify shared responsibilities, such as who leads evangelism or experiment analysis    "if you have someone that's dedicated to a zone or an area of the product, then it's much easier for them to spot patterns as opposed to attempting to understand what's happening every time a ticket comes in."  Tactical:  Embed data analysts or scientists into specific product squads to avoid them becoming a bottleneck

"You bring that person together with the product person who deeply understands the backstory... And then a designer in the room and they’re whiteboarding and wrestling with each other to get to what’s a version of this thing that we believe in that’s real that we can actually finish in that time."  Tactical:  Include a 'grumpy old plumber' (senior engineer) in shaping sessions to identify technical 'time bombs' early.Use live whiteboarding sessions to 'wrestle' with ideas until they are both technically feasible and valuable.

"we've evolved that to five legs of the stool... product eng design and we've got our insights partners. So research and analytics, and we've got our marketing partners really working in a tight team to build the best products possible... treating that as the core leadership team I think is really valuable."  Tactical:  Include research, analytics, and marketing as core members of the squad leadership team.Avoid the 'PM as mini-CEO' model in favor of collaborative decision-making.

"I've made it a point to bring in my tech lead and engineers along for this product discovery ride... When our engineers are able to understand our journalists' needs at the same level as we are, they're able to define the how to do it with so much greater clarity and precision."  Tactical:  Embed tech leads in user testing sessions and design jamsTreat engineers as partners in the 'why' and 'what,' not just resources for the 'how'

"We said, 'Hey, we can actually do the next three months of projects about any design,' which was a kind of controversial thing to say, 'but we're doing this so that you can take three months with a set of designers and go think about the system architecture of the product, and we'll wait for that to be done before we do any architectural things that might impact the architecture.'"  Tactical:  Give design teams 'breathing room' by running engineering-only tactical sprintsDedicate specific time blocks for designers to work on system architecture without the pressure of immediate feature delivery

"I really see it as this partnership to enable that much as possible. And I think that's what, to me, product growth looks like at Figma, is that. ...the face of Figma is not the sales team, but in fact, it's the internal designer. And so that's the mental model that I think we've been using it. We're fortunate enough to have people inside companies who are so passionate to want to play that role. And so when you take that lens on, then you start to understand, okay, how can we help set this person up for success?"  Tactical:  Equip sales teams with product roadmaps to share with championsFocus sales efforts on empowering the internal advocate rather than just selling to the buyerEnsure sales teams have high product credibility to hold their own with expert users

"Do you know your engineering manager's birthday? It's the day they showed up in the world. It's the most important day for them... Do you know their work anniversary? Do you know why they're doing the job they're doing or what they want to be?"  Tactical:  Learn your engineering manager's birthday and work anniversaryUnderstand your partner's career goals (e.g., do they want to be a VP or start a company?) to better support them

"I also believe that the best go-to-market orgs on the planet are equal parts revenue driving and R&D... if we can do an excellent job of translating all of that feedback into signal and then feeding that into the road map, we can be actually an extension of the product management org."  Tactical:  Train sales teams to discern signal from noise to provide actionable feedback for the product roadmap.

"They will apply a first principles product mindset to their understanding of the law, and they will push the lawyers to make sure that they're not being overly conservative, which sometimes they can be."  Tactical:  Develop a general understanding of the regulations affecting your specific consumer or SaaS businessEngage with legal teams with curiosity to understand the 'why' behind constraints

"A PM is a conductor. It's as though the team that you are a PM on is an orchestra. There are many different functions in your team that includes legal policy, comms, data analytics, engineering, design... your job is to make sure everyone's playing their part correctly, every section in the orchestra is playing their part, but at the same time, they're playing together"  Tactical:  Focus on keeping the team in sync and at the right cadence rather than doing the functional work yourselfEnsure every function (legal, policy, eng, etc.) understands how their part fits into the whole

"Slack has this really great feature called huddles where you can just quickly get on. It's just audio. So there's no video. And you can just have a 30 second conversation. It's good for standups and things like that... trying to be asynchronous, using Slack, making sure you're following up in very visible ways where people can see."  Tactical:  Use Slack Huddles for quick, low-friction standups or syncsPrioritize asynchronous updates to avoid 'Zoom fatigue'

"One of my obsessions has been bringing design earlier into the process of product development... Having the designer hear these things and contribute gives them a golden gut as they are then sitting down later and going through possible interfaces to solve the problem."  Tactical:  Bring designers into the room for customer research and high-level value proposition debatesCollapse functional boundaries so designers have the same context as product managers from day one

Tamar Yehoshua 2 quotes

"Make sure you go somewhere where you have a good engineering partner. Because if you have great ideas of what to build but you can't get them built, then you go nowhere. So that has to be part of your evaluation criteria that you meet and value your engineering partner before you join. And then I think what's really important is that you're aligned. You understand your roles and responsibilities and where you're going to divide and conquer and where you're going to be aligned. You don't want any of this ... Like people in the organization, they ask mom, they asked dad and they got different opinions and playing one against the other. That doesn't work."  Tactical:  Evaluate the engineering partner as part of your job interview criteria.Explicitly define which leader drives which domain to avoid 'mom and dad' syndrome.Conduct all major reviews (OKRs, exec reviews) together to ensure alignment.    "If somebody would ask me something that it was in Cal's domain, I'd be like, 'Did you talk to Cal?' I would never try and go around him. So we were very clear on, you're going to drive this, I'm going to drive this. And if it was unclear, we'd talk and we would say, 'Okay. Who's going to take this one?'"  Tactical:  Redirect questions that fall into your partner's domain back to them.Discuss ambiguous ownership areas privately to decide who will lead.

"We call our org, it's called AMPED, A-M-P-E-D. This is actually going back to our earlier point... removing barriers or silos cross-functionally. AMPED stands for analytics, marketing, product, engineering and design."  Tactical:  Embed product marketing deeply within product 'streams' to ensure positioning is considered during early development.Define the 'product org' as a multi-disciplinary unit (AMPED) rather than just PMs, designers, and engineers.    "My fundamental approach to solving that is to ensure that the product leads who are working on these capabilities can instantly raise their hand and call out that there are challenges that they are running into. Then the job of the leadership team... is to essentially go and quickly resolve those issues."  Tactical:  Create a culture where raising a hand for help is seen as a strength, not a failure.Focus leadership time on resolving organizational, technical, or priority roadblocks identified by feature teams.

Will Larson 2 quotes

"My biggest advice to both the EMs and the PMs, is before you try to solve the conflict, it's like pushing to ship this feature, pushing to change the approach. Just make sure you actually understand what they care about... if you really deeply understand what everyone wants, there's usually a compromised solution that gives everyone exactly what they want."  Tactical:  Dig deeper into the 'true needs' of your partner, which are often not what they are explicitly sayingAvoid the 'victim/villain' mindset when peers make decisions you disagree with    "I think this idea that same perf rating for both drives a level of one pain, but the right perspective... you all get graded the same score based on your ability to evaluate and solve for the entire set of constraints, not just your functional constraints."  Tactical:  Calibrate performance reviews for EM and PM peers togetherGrade leaders on their ability to solve for the entire set of business constraints
