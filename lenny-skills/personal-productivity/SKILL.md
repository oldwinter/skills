Personal Productivity  Personal productivity is the system of habits, tools, and time management techniques that allow high performers to accomplish exceptional amounts of work. This goes beyond generic advice - it involves specific practices like time boxing, obsessive task management, and structuring your schedule to maximize output.

Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 2 experts.

1 Master time boxing  Time boxing is the practice of allocating specific blocks of time to specific activities, rather than working until something is done. This creates forcing functions that increase focus and prevent work from expanding to fill available time. Even high-intensity schedules become manageable when every hour has a purpose.

Featured guest perspectives

"It's really time boxing and knowing... I also do two hours each on both Saturday and Sunday so that I can do four meetings each."

— Gokul Rajaram        2 Write everything down  Get everything out of your head and into a reliable external system. Writing things down frees up mental bandwidth for actual work and ensures nothing falls through the cracks. This isn't just about having a to-do list - it's about trusting that system completely so your brain stops trying to remember things.

Featured guest perspectives

"I write everything down because I think I'm one of those people I remember things best when they're written down and then I obsessively put things on my to-do list."

— Maya Prohovnik        3 Be obsessive about your task management system  Half-hearted productivity systems don't work. Commit fully to whatever system you choose and use it obsessively. The specific tool matters less than the consistency of use. When your system becomes second nature, the cognitive overhead of managing work disappears.
