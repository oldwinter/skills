Systems Thinking  Systems thinking is the ability to see beyond individual decisions to understand how components interact, how incentives align (or conflict), and what second and third-order effects will emerge. It's the difference between solving a local problem and understanding the ecosystem that created it.

Read Guide

The Guide  4 key steps synthesized from 6 experts.

1 See the system, not just the parts  Strategic thinking means seeing the invisible rules, culture, and interoperability that govern how products and organizations succeed or fail. Before solving a problem, map out all the players, their incentives, and how they interact with each other.

Featured guest perspectives

"What does it mean to be a strategic thinker? It means to see the system."

— Seth Godin    "Systems thinking. Think of all the players in the system, think of all of their incentives and how they interact with each other."

— Sriram and Aarthi        2 Think in stocks and flows  Model reality using 'stocks' (things that accumulate) and 'flows' (movement between stocks). Apply this to business processes like hiring pipelines, customer funnels, or engineering capacity. This framework reveals bottlenecks and leverage points that aren't obvious from static analysis.

Featured guest perspectives

"Systems thinking is basically you try to think about stocks and flows. So stocks are things that accumulate and flows are kind of the movement from a stock to another thing."

— Will Larson        3 Practice second-order thinking  Think beyond the immediate decision to understand how it impacts future constraints and ecosystem dynamics. Ask: if we make this choice, what does it enable or prevent six months from now? What behaviors will it incentivize that we haven't considered?

Featured guest perspectives

"Basically what second order thinking is is you being able to think beyond the decisions that you're making today."

— Nickey Skarstad    "I do think that the skillsets that you think through and you try to manage in a complicated ecosystem are quite different."

— Hari Srinivasan        4 Build systems to solve recurring problems  When you encounter recurring manual pain, don't just solve it once - build a system or framework to address it automatically going forward. This 'systematizing' instinct is what separates operators from systems thinkers.

Featured guest perspectives

"Tell me about some process or something that you had to do in your job that you really hated and that you ended up just trying to automate a way or build a system around it to make it better."

— Melissa Perri + Denise Tilles

✗ Common Mistakes

Optimizing locally without understanding impacts on the broader systemIgnoring incentive misalignment between different playersSolving problems manually instead of building systems to prevent recurrenceFocusing on first-order effects and being surprised by downstream consequences     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

You can map the full system of players and incentives before proposing solutionsYour decisions account for second and third-order effectsProblems you solve stay solved because you addressed the systemic causeYou can predict how changes in one area will ripple through the organization
