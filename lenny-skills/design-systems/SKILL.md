Design Systems  Design systems are the shared language of components, patterns, and principles that enable teams to build consistent products at scale. They separate conceptual 'heavy lifting' from production, allowing rapid high-fidelity output. A good design system is intuitive enough that non-experts can use it correctly.

Read Guide

The Guide  4 key steps synthesized from 4 experts.

1 Separate conceptual work from visual production  Use low-fidelity 'block brain diagrams' or wireframes to lock down the conceptual logic before applying the design system. Once the thinking is done, the system enables rapid high-fidelity execution. This separation lets teams move from concept to polished output overnight.

Featured guest perspectives

"Once we locked down on the block frames, we could send it to an agency and they could do the full high-res comps in a day, because they knew exactly what they were doing. And so the PMs were always like, what the hell happened overnight?"

— Bob Baxley        2 Design assets that teach themselves  Create a system intuitive enough that non-designers can use assets correctly without a massive brand book. The goal is assets that teach users how to apply them through their inherent structure. Prioritize ease of use over complexity to ensure consistency as the company scales.

Featured guest perspectives

"My goal always when designing a logo is to design a logo that's so easy to use that you don't have to be an extremely skilled designer to design well with it... I just want the assets to teach you themselves, by just how they exist, how to use it."

— Jessica Hische        3 Position design systems as enterprise value  Design systems are often the key driver for enterprise upgrades - the practitioners who build them become internal champions for platform expansion. Target design system users as the operational 'hook' for organizational scaling and bottoms-up adoption.

Featured guest perspectives

"Design systems are one of the main reasons you upgrade from pro to org or enterprise... that became just the key thing we leaned in on. And that's bottoms up specific, because the people making the design systems are not like the VP, still."

— Claire Butler        4 Evolve aesthetics with the era  Design systems shouldn't be static. Interface design trends evolve - the 2010s were defined by flat design, but we're moving toward more dimensional, tactile experiences with color, texture, and haptic feedback. Stay aware of broader aesthetic shifts and update your system accordingly.

Featured guest perspectives

"I'd like to make the announcement that I think flat design is over or ending... I think we're going to move back into a world with color, texture, dimensionality, more haptic feedback."

— Brian Chesky

✗ Common Mistakes

Creating a system so complex that only expert designers can use it correctlyJumping straight to high-fidelity production before locking down conceptsTreating the design system as static rather than evolving with trendsNot recognizing design system practitioners as enterprise adoption champions     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Non-designers can use the system to create consistent, on-brand materialsTime from concept to polished output is measured in hours, not weeksDesign system practitioners are driving enterprise expansion within customer organizationsThe system evolves with aesthetic trends rather than feeling dated

"I'd like to make the announcement that I think flat design is over or ending. I think if you remember the 2000s was dominated by skeuomorphism. The 2010s have been dominated with the launch of iOS seven by flat design. And I think we're going to move back into a world with color, texture, dimensionality, more haptic feedback"  Tactical:  Explore dimensionality and texture in UI designLeverage AI for more sophisticated interface elements

"My goal always when designing a logo is to design a logo that's so easy to use that you don't have to be an extremely skilled designer to design well with it. That's my number one goal, because I know not everybody is going to be at a stage where they have an internal brand team or a designer that's a rock star designer that can work with really complicated assets and make them look good. I just want the assets to teach you themselves, by just how they exist, how to use it."  Tactical:  Design assets that 'teach' the user how to apply them through their inherent structure.Prioritize ease of use over complexity to ensure the brand remains consistent as the company scales.
