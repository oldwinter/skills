Startup Ideation  Startup ideation is the skill of finding and evaluating new business ideas with high potential. The best ideas often come from going off the beaten path - unique personal experiences, diversified information diets, and rigorous 'why now' analysis. Avoiding 'tarpit' ideas that trap founders is equally important as finding promising ones.

Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 2 experts.

1 Go off the beaten path from personal experience  The best startup ideas often come from your unique background and experiences rather than following obvious trends. Look for problems you've personally encountered that others haven't noticed. Your unusual combination of experiences gives you access to insights that others literally cannot see.

"Try to go more off the beaten path either from your personal experience..."

— Dalton Caldwell        2 Ask 'Why Now?' for every idea  For any idea to work as a startup, something must have changed recently that makes it possible. Ask: What new thing can you build today that couldn't be built yesterday? This might be a technology shift (AI, crypto), a regulatory change, or a behavior shift. If you can't answer 'why now,' the timing probably isn't right.

— Ryan Hoover        3 Diversify your information diet  If you consume the same information as everyone else in tech, you'll have the same ideas. Deliberately diversify what you read, who you talk to, and what industries you explore. Unique insights come from unique inputs - expose yourself to domains and perspectives that your peers ignore.
