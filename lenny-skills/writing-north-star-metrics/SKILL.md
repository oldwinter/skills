Writing North Star Metrics  A North Star metric captures the core value your product delivers to users. It aligns the entire organization around a single measure of success and serves as a tie-breaker for prioritization decisions. The power of a good North Star lies not in mathematical perfection but in its ability to galvanize action, end debates, and focus everyone on what truly matters.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 27 experts.

1 Measure the value delivered to users, not business outputs  Your North Star should capture the specific unit of value the user receives—messages sent, nights booked, successful hires. This is distinct from what the business captures (revenue). Revenue should be an outcome of delivering value, not the North Star itself. Focus on customer-centric inputs that have a causal relationship with business outputs.

Featured guest perspectives

"The North Star metric measures how much value we create for the market. For example, let's take WhatsApp. WhatsApp for a very long time measured messages sent because every message sent is a little incremental of value for the sender, the receiver."

— Itamar Gilad    "I think monthly purchases is great because it maps to value that people are getting from Amazon... units of value from the customer perspective I think is more important than overall revenue. Revenue should be a product of doing things. It shouldn't kind of guide your day-to-day actions."

— Sean Ellis    "What was the value that we're trying to produce for the customer and can we measure it from their perspective?... We suggested this metric to ourselves, companies that have no support tickets through the incorporation service."

— Jeff Weinstein        2 Optimize for clarity and memorability over precision  The best North Star metrics are simple enough that anyone can remember them and intuitive enough that non-technical stakeholders can discuss them. A complex composite score that nobody understands will fail to drive behavior. Choose a discrete number and timeframe that ends academic debates and moves the team toward execution.

Featured guest perspectives

"What I thought was brilliant about it was not the metric, it was the designing it to be understood and communicated... Zuck just said 10 friends, 14 days, go. It just got people past the academic debate of like, All right, got it. As many friends as possible, the fast as possible, let's go."

— Adriel Frederick    "Keeping things simple is another thing I've learned... if people understand it, if they have an intuition around it, if it's something that people can talk about across the company, it's going to be a much better metric in terms of driving real outcomes than your made up composite score that nobody understands."

— Jess Lachs    "Picking metric titles that make you feel something... 'companies with zero support,' that's it. And the brevity and the focus and the customer mindset built into the chart name can become currency inside the company."

— Jeff Weinstein        3 Find the input metric that drives your North Star  Retention is a terrible thing to goal on directly—it's too slow to move. Instead, identify the short-term input metrics that predict long-term outcomes. Look for the specific threshold or activation milestone that has the highest correlation with retention or upgrade likelihood. This is what teams can actually influence.

Featured guest perspectives

"Retention is a terrible thing to goal on. It's almost impossible to drive in a meaningful way in a short term. Ultimately, you want to find a short-term metric you can measure that drives a long-term output."

— Jess Lachs    "We did a lot of quantitative research and data science and wound up coming up with this new metric we call successful teams... if you could get five people using Slack, the majority of the work week to just communicate at all, that would be a successful team there were going to be 400% more likely to upgrade over the next six months."

— Noah Weiss    "Duolingo cares, our growth North Star is DAUs, the metric that is most effective, where a percentage change in that metric is most effective at driving DAUs is current user retention rate."

— Jackson Shuttleworth        4 Create a hierarchy that teams can ladder up to  Every team needs to understand how their specific work impacts the primary metric. Create a 'translation layer' that maps local team metrics back to the North Star. This allows teams to own metrics they can directly influence while maintaining alignment with company-wide goals.

Featured guest perspectives

"At Instacart, for example, our north star metric for growth was monthly active orders... Create a 'translation layer' that maps local team metrics (like conversion or load time) back to the North Star."

— Sri Batchu    "The GM's goal is to sell out the tickets and win the conference championship and it actually tiers it down... explain how it all levels up to this one North Star metric for the company."

— Chris Hutchins        5 Don't be afraid to use qualitative signals early on  In early-stage products, standard 'grown-up' metrics like retention or CTR can be misleading with small sample sizes. Look for qualitative signals and specific 'magic moments' that indicate you're on the right track. Nail the high-value action first before measuring broad engagement.

Featured guest perspectives

"When you're looking at something zero-to-one. If you decide on a metric too prematurely, that's false precision... CTR. When you have a thousand people, it doesn't mean anything. Retention also may not mean anything. So really being very wary of this big guy, big girl of grownup metrics."

— Aparna Chennapragada    "Traditional engagement metrics might be misleading when depth matters more than frequency... so much of when you get really metrics obsessed is when you're trying to convince yourself that it is when it's not."

— Mike Krieger        6 Balance your North Star with guardrail metrics  No single metric tells the whole story. Use an Overall Evaluation Criterion that balances your primary goal with countervailing metrics to ensure long-term health. Watch for 'fail states' that averages hide. A focus on one metric without guardrails can lead to gaming or unintended consequences.

Featured guest perspectives

"The OEC or the overall evaluation criterion... what are you optimizing for? And it's a much harder question that people think because it's very easy to say we're going to optimize for money, revenue. But that's the wrong question, because you can do a lot of bad things that will improve revenue."

— Ronny Kohavi    "One of the things Airbnb did for experiences is we had this balancing metric, which was basically using the review rate as sort our end all, be all top line goal... we were obsessed with making sure every person who booked actually had a good experience."

— Nickey Skarstad    "It's so important to find these edge cases in these fail states and actually set concrete goals around eliminating them because it can be really powerful."

— Jess Lachs

✗ Common Mistakes

Using revenue as your North Star instead of a measure of customer valueCreating complex composite metrics that nobody can remember or explainGoaling directly on retention instead of finding the input metrics that drive itApplying 'grown-up' metrics too early in product developmentOptimizing a single metric without guardrails against gaming or unintended consequences     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Everyone in the company can recite the North Star metric from memoryTeam metrics clearly ladder up to the primary company metricDecisions get made faster because there's a clear tie-breakerThe metric reflects value delivered to users, not just business outcomesYou've identified the input metric that teams can actually influence

"When you're looking at something zero-to-one. If you decide on a metric two prematurely, that's false precision first of all, right? I mean, CTR. When you have a thousand people, it doesn't mean anything. Retention also may not mean anything. So really being very wary of this big guy, big girl of grownup metrics as I call it, right? You are looking for more qualitative, the sound of click."  Tactical:  Avoid false precision in early-stage metricsLook for qualitative 'sound of click' signals from early usersIdentify specific high-value actions (like setting a timer) to nail first before measuring broad engagement

"You know it's an input metric if it is measuring something with respect to the customer experience. Which ones are the right metrics, which ones are the most causal to the outputs... basically through an iterative process of measuring, observing, improving, and looking at what the effect is on your outputs."  Tactical:  Map the end-to-end customer experience to identify potential input metricsTest metrics for causality by observing if improvements in the input lead to improvements in the output

"My north star metric is insights per minute. That's what I try to use whenever I have any live meetings with people so it squarely fits within what I'm optimizing for."  Tactical:  Define a metric that measures the density of value delivered (e.g., 'insights per minute') rather than just volume.Use this metric to guide the preparation and execution of live meetings and presentations.

"A critical part of that process obviously is identifying we have to measure success along the way. There should be a KPI for each of those stages in that customer journey... we try to tie the KPI obviously to some sort of meaningful product usage of that key part of the product or product attribute."  Tactical:  Define a KPI for 'first value' (activation) and 'value realization' (full engagement)Tie KPIs to specific feature usage that correlates with customer success

"Everything at LinkedIn is a very connected ecosystem... how you make decisions based on the very complicated ecosystem is actually not very difficult because we're all here to help people connect to economic opportunity. Every time there's a discussion... everyone knows how that decision is going to be made."  Tactical:  Establish a singular, company-wide mission that serves as the ultimate tie-breaker for product decisions    "We think a lot about number of hires, converting hires. How many people did we match? Which is a real tangible way of looking at opportunity. And then number of people who learned a skill, which is usually in this world measured more by time than anything if you learn."  Tactical:  Measure marketplace success through conversion events (e.g., hires) and engagement depth (e.g., time spent learning)

"What was the value that we're trying to produce for the customer and can we measure it from their perspective? ... We suggested this metric to ourselves, companies that have no support tickets through the incorporation service."  Tactical:  Define metrics based on the absence of friction (e.g., 'zero support tickets').Ensure the metric is something you would be proud to show the customer.    "Picking metric titles that make you feel something... 'companies with zero support,' that's it. And the brevity and the focus and the customer mindset built into the chart name can become currency inside the company."  Tactical:  Use simple, evocative names for metrics instead of technical database field names.Maintain high hygiene on dashboards (consistent X-axes, limited significant digits) to encourage daily viewing.

"Retention is a terrible thing to goal on. It's almost impossible to drive in a meaningful way in a short term. Ultimately, you want to find a short-term metric you can measure that drives a long-term output."  Tactical:  Identify proxy metrics that are sensitive to experimentation and correlate with long-term goals.Focus on inputs that the team can realistically influence within a quarterly or monthly timeframe.    "Keeping things simple is another thing I've learned... if people understand it, if they have an intuition around it, if it's something that people can talk about across the company, it's going to be a much better metric in terms of driving real outcomes than your made up composite score that nobody understands."  Tactical:  Prioritize metrics that non-technical stakeholders can intuitively understand and discuss.Avoid composite metrics with complex coefficients that obscure the relationship between action and result.    "It's so important to find these edge cases in these fail states and actually set concrete goals around eliminating them because it can be really powerful."  Tactical:  Identify 'fail states' (e.g., 'Never Delivered' orders) that cause extreme churn and high costs.Set concrete goals to reduce the frequency of these edge cases, even if they represent a small percentage of total volume.

"I wrote the North Star Playbook in partnership with Jason who was a co-writer with that. We did a lot of one-to-one coaching sessions. I had these things called product therapy sessions when I would just wake up in the morning and just kind of soak in whatever problem people were having for the day."  Tactical:  Use the 'three games of product' framework to categorize how your North Star inputs function.    "In Amplitude, we have this data informed product loop that we would teach, and it's basically, you need a strategy, you need to develop qualitative models, you need to add measurement to those models. So Northstar framework would be an example of a qualitative model."  Tactical:  Develop a qualitative model of your product's value before attempting to measure it.

"Management is still really critical. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done."  Tactical:  Define a clear North Star and vision for the team.    "The first is defining the goal and defining the outcome and being really, really crystal clear on what does success look like... figuring out how to boil it down so that an agent can really understand what success and failure looks like is a lot of the game."  Tactical:  Create objective criteria to distinguish between success and failure for automated tasks.Use evals to provide objective measures of performance.

"The real question, what does engagement mean? Actually, a have fun exercise that people could do with their teams is if you ask everyone on the team what engagement means separately, you can compare answers and most likely, people are saying different things."  Tactical:  Run a workshop where team members define the core success metric separately to identify and resolve misalignments.

"An activation rate that falls in a lower percentage range, maybe for most companies five to 15%, is better than one that falls in a higher percentage range because it means that there's likely much higher correlation with long-term retention and you're really working hard to get most of your users to reach a state that they're not reaching today."  Tactical:  Select activation metrics that have a high correlation with long-term retentionAim for a 'hard' activation milestone (5-15% success rate) to ensure it represents true product valueBreak down the North Star metric into component levers to identify specific areas for optimization    "A north star metric should really be a measure of what you plan to do, the strategy you plan to deliver is delivering results for the business on the other side, rather than the other way around."  Tactical:  Revisit North Star metrics every 6-12 months to ensure they still align with business goalsBe willing to shift from revenue-focused metrics to user-growth metrics if the strategy requires a long-term viewUse the North Star as a measure of strategic success rather than the sole driver of all decisions

"Even if revenue is a goal, it's like revenue is not actually the goal. Revenue is a proxy for getting more compute, which is then actually what helps us get towards getting more GPUs so that we can train better models and actually get to the goal."  Tactical:  Identify the 'intermediate layers' of your goals to understand what your metrics are actually a proxy for.Align metrics like revenue or adoption directly with the resource needs of the primary mission.

Manik Gupta 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Having the right metrics is important, but it's incredible how many times people have the metrics but they don't instrument them. They'll have all these debates, because the product is not instrumented properly. And everybody will talk about the same metric, but they'll have different nuances in terms of, 'Oh, what does it really mean? What is a daily active user? Okay, daily means... Okay, I understand it's on a daily basis. What is active?' And there'll be debates about what is active. Pick a definition, instrument it, codify it. No confusion."  Tactical:  Codify the exact definition of 'active' for your product to prevent cross-functional debates.Ensure instrumentation is a core part of the development process so data is indisputable.

"It's not that hard to go to the stakeholder that requested that and say, "We're going to get to work on that, but can you tell me how are you measuring success? We want to make sure that what we do, you consider it successful. How are you measuring success?""

"Traditional engagement metrics might be misleading when depth matters more than frequency... I think overall though... I think you know when your product is really serving people... so much of when you get really metrics obsessed is when you're trying to convince yourself that it is when it's not."  Tactical:  Be wary of optimizing for 'likability' or 'sycophancy' in AI models as it can degrade actual utility.Focus on whether the tool is helping users 'get their work done' or 'unlock creativity' rather than just daily active usage.

Tactical:  Find the specific threshold of users and activity that predicts a 400% increase in upgrade likelihood.Rally feature teams around this activation metric rather than just top-of-funnel or revenue metrics.

"The OEC or the overall evaluation criterion is something that I think many people that start to dabble in A/B testing miss. And the question is, what are you optimizing for? And it's a much harder question that people think because it's very easy to say we're going to optimize for money, revenue. But that's the wrong question, because you can do a lot of bad things that will improve revenue. So there has to be some countervailing metric that tells you, how do I improve revenue without hurting the user experience?"  Tactical:  Define an OEC that is causally predictive of the lifetime value of the userInclude countervailing metrics (like churn or unsubscribe rates) to prevent gaming the system

"Step two for me is then figure out a metric that essentially captures units of that value being delivered. And so when I think about a north star metric, that's what I'm thinking about is something that reflects how many people are coming in and experiencing that product-market fit experience, whatever that is."  Tactical:  Define the North Star based on the 'must-have' value identified in PMF surveys.Ensure the metric is an aggregate number (not a ratio) that can grow over time.    "I think monthly purchases is great because it maps to value that people are getting from Amazon... units of value from the customer perspective I think is more important than overall revenue. ... revenue should be a product of doing things. Right. It shouldn't kind of guide your day-to-day actions."  Tactical:  Avoid using revenue as a North Star Metric; use a proxy for customer value instead.Select a timeframe (daily, weekly, monthly) that matches the natural usage cycle of the product.

"having GMS as our north star KPI, just having that, being absolutely front and center, being the drumbeat that we talk about in every meeting, the measuring stick that we measure the success of launches against. And maybe it's a bit surprising, but we didn't have that type of clarity in the past."  Tactical:  Use the North Star metric as the primary drumbeat in every meeting.Measure the success of every launch against this primary KPI.

"I would say north star metric, because I find it's not only valuable to growth, it's valuable to just everything. When I think about what do I want to do with my career, does that fit my own personal north star metric?"  Tactical:  Use a North Star Metric to filter out short-term noise and focus on long-term value

Josh Miller 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"we really focus on one key metric as it relates to tracking our growth or how we are doing. We call it D5, D7. A lot of other companies call it L5, L7. But the human explanation for that is how many people turn to Arc at least five days a week? That is all we obsess over from a metrics perspective, because for us it captures retention, engagement, and growth in a single metric."  Tactical:  Track the number of users who are active at least 5 out of 7 daysFocus on the week-over-week growth rate of this metric rather than absolute numbers
