Organizational Design  Organizational design is the strategic structuring of teams, roles, and decision-making processes to achieve business objectives. The choice between centralized (Apple-style) and decentralized (Amazon-style) models has profound implications for product coherence, speed, and user experience. Getting this right is one of a leader's most consequential decisions.

Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 2 experts.

1 Understand the centralized vs. decentralized spectrum  Every organizational model falls somewhere on a spectrum. On one end is Amazon's model: minimize dependencies so teams can run in parallel, accepting some inconsistency. On the other end is Apple's model: centrally organized around a unified vision, accepting slower speed for coherence. Neither is inherently better - the right choice depends on your product and market.

Featured guest perspectives

"On one spectrum, you have something like Amazon... minimize dependencies so you can run in parallel... On the other spectrum, you have something like Apple... centrally organized by something that is close to single individual."

— Gustav Soderstrom        2 Consider returning to a functional model  When complexity becomes overwhelming, sometimes the answer is to simplify radically. Going back to a functional model - organizing by discipline (engineering, design, product) rather than by product line - can restore startup-like agility. This often requires removing management layers and eliminating roles that exist just to coordinate.

"We went to a functional model. We went back to a startup."

— Brian Chesky        3 Eliminate people managers who don't know the work  Restructure roles so that managers are deeply embedded in the actual work their teams do. 'People managers' who exist only to coordinate and don't understand the craft create information loss and slow decision-making. Leaders should be practitioners who can guide the work, not just facilitate it.

✗ Common Mistakes

Copying another company's org structure without understanding why it works for themAdding coordination layers instead of removing dependenciesOptimizing for individual team speed at the cost of overall product coherenceKeeping managers who can't do the work their teams do     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Teams can ship without waiting on other teams for most decisionsYour product feels coherent to users, not like a collection of disconnected featuresManagers can step in and do the work when needed, not just manage processYou can explain why your org structure is right for your specific situation
