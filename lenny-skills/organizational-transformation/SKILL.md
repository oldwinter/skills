Organizational Transformation  Organizational transformation is the skill of moving a company from one operating model to another - typically from feature teams to empowered product teams. This goes beyond team building or process improvement; it requires specific transformation techniques that address structure, culture, and mindset simultaneously.

Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 2 experts.

1 Understand that framework adoption isn't the goal  Many companies make the mistake of treating framework adoption (Agile, OKRs, etc.) as the end goal. But frameworks are tools, not destinations. The real transformation is in how people think and work, not in what ceremonies they follow. Focus on outcomes, not processes.

Featured guest perspectives

"Most of those companies need to think of frameworks appropriately... they see adopting the frameworks as the end goal."

— John Cutler        2 Learn transformation techniques, not just best practices  There's a difference between knowing what good looks like and knowing how to get there. Transformation requires specific techniques for changing entrenched behavior and systems. Study how other companies have actually changed, not just what they ended up looking like.

Featured guest perspectives

"The goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques."

— Marty Cagan        3 Nudge legacy organizations without causing rejection  Moving traditional or non-Silicon Valley companies toward modern product practices requires political skill. Push too hard and the organization's immune system will reject the change. The skill is in nudging - making incremental changes that compound over time without triggering defensive responses.
