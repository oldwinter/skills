Written Communication  Clear writing is clear thinking made visible—and in remote, async work environments, writing skill directly correlates with influence and impact. The best written communicators are concise, structured, and write for their specific audience's needs rather than their own desire to share information.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 38 experts.

1 Lead with the bottom line, not the backstory  Put your conclusion, recommendation, or key point first. Busy readers may only read the first paragraph—make sure it contains the essential message. Background and supporting details come after, for those who want to dig deeper.

Featured guest perspectives

"Lead with the answer... executives want to know what you're recommending before they hear the analysis."

— Dave Girouard    "Don't bury the lede... the most important thing should be the first thing."

— Wes Kao        2 Write for your specific audience, not for yourself  Consider what your reader already knows, what they care about, and what they need to make a decision. Adjust your level of detail and framing accordingly. Writing that works for your CEO won't work for your engineering team and vice versa.

Featured guest perspectives

"Think about who your audience is and what they care about... write for them, not for you."

— Wes Kao    "Different audiences need different framing... know what motivates your reader and speak to that."

— Claire Hughes Johnson        3 Use structure to aid comprehension  Break up walls of text with headers, bullet points, and clear sections. Visual structure helps readers navigate and find what they need. A well-structured document respects the reader's time and makes your thinking easier to follow.

Featured guest perspectives

"Structure your documents so people can find what they need... not everyone will read everything."

— Claire Hughes Johnson    "Good formatting is a form of respect... it signals that you value the reader's time."

— Boz (Andrew Bosworth)        4 Edit ruthlessly for clarity and concision  Your first draft is never your best draft. Cut unnecessary words, simplify complex sentences, and remove anything that doesn't directly support your point. The goal is minimum words for maximum clarity—every sentence should earn its place.

Featured guest perspectives

"Edit aggressively... if you can remove a word without losing meaning, remove it."

— Boz (Andrew Bosworth)    "Brevity is a gift to your reader... dense writing signals lazy thinking."

— Wes Kao        5 Calibrate certainty—say what you know and don't know  Be explicit about your confidence level. Distinguish between facts, estimates, and hunches. This builds trust and helps readers calibrate how much weight to give your points. Hedging appropriately isn't weakness—it's intellectual honesty.

Featured guest perspectives

"I'm a big proponent of speaking accurately... differentiate between 'this is X' (fact) and 'this could be X' (hypothesis)."

— Wes Kao

✗ Common Mistakes

Burying the key point after paragraphs of context and backstoryWriting at the same level of detail regardless of audienceTreating the first draft as the final draftUsing vague language when precision would build more trust     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Readers respond to your actual ask instead of asking clarifying questionsDocuments get decisions without requiring follow-up meetingsPeople forward your writing to others as good examplesYou receive feedback that your communication is clear and easy to action

"Maybe in 10 different one-on-ones with people on the team, I had to explain to them a strategic thing that we were doing... Well, you know what? That should probably be a document, right? If the same idea worked for 10 different people... now I'll write that document in 30 minutes and now I have it as a memorialized thing that other people can read on their own time without having to involve me."  Tactical:  Identify patterns in 1:1 conversations and turn successful explanations into permanent docs.Use metaphors to connect 'nine of the ten dots,' inviting the reader to engage and connect the final dot themselves.

Boz 2 quotes

"Communication is the job... it is exclusively done through the creation of artifacts or verbalizations that affect other humans. That is all there is."  Tactical:  Take extreme ownership of whether your message was successfully received by the audience.Understand that silence and the absence of check-ins are also forms of communication.    "One is multimodality... I will give an all-hands and then write a post with the content of the all-hands, because different people are going to respond differently to these modalities."  Tactical:  Repeat key points using different metaphors and modalities (verbal, written, visual).Address the audience's fears and concerns at the very beginning to establish trust in your premise.

Brandon Chu 1 quote

"It was the writing process itself that actually allowed me to solidify those mental models and those frameworks in my mind. And so I wasn't ahead of the game in any way. It was just I think I really wanted to disambiguate the chaos in my mind about what my job was."  Tactical:  Use writing to 'release' ideas from your mind and clear space for new thinkingInvest significant time (e.g., 40 hours) into editing and refining core ideasShare raw, early thoughts with others to test how your internal narrative resonates externally

Christina Wodtke 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"They were like, "What's your confidence level on your key results? What did you do last week? And what are you doing next week?" And the last week, next week is great because it allows you to start noting down what stops you from getting shit done."  Tactical:  Send weekly status updates (via email or Slack) including confidence levels (1-10) for each KR.List 'P1' priorities for the next week and reflect on why previous priorities weren't met.

Claire Hughes Johnson 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Whenever I do write something down, I'm glad I did. So I probably do more crystallizing by writing than I would admit."  Tactical:  Use the act of writing to force clarity on topics you think you already understand    "Having really smart communication practices is something that I think a lot of companies don't invest in early... Do you have a newsletter? Do you have founders do like a message or a quick video, whether that's on Slack or email. There's a lot of smart tools. You can learn a lot from social media in some ways, but you actually need a strategy for it."  Tactical:  Invest in an internal intranet or centralized homepage for company informationUse a mix of newsletters, Slack messages, and short videos to reach different audiencesCreate a 'weekly snippets' document to share important news across teams

Deb Liu 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"His advice was write what you repeat. If you say something more than once, just write it down. And then the next time someone asks you, you can just hand them."  Tactical:  Identify recurring questions or topics in your 1:1s and turn them into written memos or blog postsUse written artifacts to provide consistent guidance across a large organization

"It's the megaphone issue. Someone will pass you in the hall... they'll ask you a question, and as it turns out... people will take that and over-index on what was an opinion... flash tags are literally... an escalating set of what I call the dying on the hill spectrum."  Tactical:  Use #FYI for information with no response expected.Use #Suggestion for ideas that don't require a response.Use #Recommendation for thought-out ideas where a response is expected if the recipient disagrees.Use #Plea for high-conviction requests that are still not mandates.

Eeke de Milliano 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Stripe had a very strong writing culture. All communication was along from writing business reviews, strategy memos, product reviews... I don't think you can be a good writer, unless you're a clear thinker."  Tactical:  Use long-form writing for business and product reviews instead of just slidesEvaluate candidates on their ability to write clearly as a proxy for clear thinking

Elizabeth Stone 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I take notes in leadership meetings and I share those notes with the whole organization. And that is sometimes it includes candor around reflections on things that aren't going well or problems we need to solve."  Tactical:  Share leadership meeting notes broadly to provide 'context, not control'Include reflections on failures or unsolved problems in internal updates to model candor

Emilie Gerber 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I would say my most successful pitches are three sentences and anytime... Sometimes it needs to be longer than that, and generally I feel like my pitch is weaker for that reason. Attention spans are short, and so the more concise you can make it, the better."  Tactical:  Keep email pitches to three sentences when possibleAvoid over-explaining or using marketing jargon in outreach    "When I email a reporter, I love to make the subject line just as clear as possible as what the goal is and why I'm emailing them. And so let's say it's for a recurring column that they have, I'll put the name of that column and the person that I think should be included in the subject line."  Tactical:  Include the name of a specific column in the subject lineState the goal (e.g., 'funding story' or 'guest idea') immediately

Gergely 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"To write that post, it takes at least a few days or sometimes even longer. Sometimes it takes a week or two for me to research... I write a first draft. I get some feedback from people who I trust often... And then there's an editing phase where I work with an editor who helps make sure that it's just correct."  Tactical:  Incorporate a feedback loop with trusted peers before publishing deep-dive content.Hire a professional editor to ensure clarity and correctness, especially for long-form technical pieces.    "I wrote four or five books' worth of content just last year. It's because I have these deadlines... I also know that thousands of people are paying me, they have expectations of me."  Tactical:  Create public or paid commitments to force a consistent writing schedule.Break large writing projects (like books) into smaller, publishable units (like newsletter posts) to maintain motivation.

Geoff Charles 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"The best way of doing that is to shut down your laptop, take out a piece of paper, write the question as simply as possible at the top of the paper, and just spend time just thinking about how to answer that question."  Tactical:  Block out deep work time specifically for thinking and writing without a laptop.Start a document with a single, simple question at the top and attempt to answer it from scratch.Write to free up headspace for processing rather than using your brain for memory.

Ian McAllister 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I think business writing, I spent a lot of that time doing that at Amazon, is so valuable because you've got to be a clear thinker to be a clear communicator. And so there's two tests in writing well or communicating well. It's both those things. So I found it's pretty valuable in kind of sharpening your ax."  Tactical:  Organize thoughts to be compact and avoid being wordy or ramblingUse writing as a mechanism to sharpen your own thinking    "Avoid weasel words, answer first and then explain, own your problems... if you can get in the habit early of answering a when question with a date, knowing how to use numbers to answer questions and honestly just learning from feedback and grade yourself after you get feedback on a doc or after a meeting."  Tactical:  Answer the core question first before providing contextAvoid 'weasel words' that obscure meaningAnswer 'when' questions with specific datesGrade your own performance after meetings or document reviews

Jason Feifer 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"What you want to do is write something that makes it pretty clear to me that this is targeted to me. That's step number one... Don't fake it. People fake it all the time. People email me and they tell me they're fans of my work, they've never read my work. It's very obvious, right? Don't do that. But if you've read something, or if you're familiar with something, if you're familiar with the publication in some way, any signals of that are good."  Tactical:  Keep pitch emails short—ideally three paragraphs maximum.Reference specific past articles or podcast episodes to prove you are not sending a mass blast.Structure pitches using 'Problem' and 'Solution' bullet points to make them easily scannable for busy editors.

Listen to episode →

"The first one is this book here, so Several Short Sentences About Writing... It's an extraordinarily good book about writing and it's all about the sentence, beautifully written, fun to read, really great."  Tactical:  Focus on the 'sentence' as the fundamental unit of clear communicationRead 'Several Short Sentences About Writing' to improve clarity

Jason Shah 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Every employee goes through actually like a business writing class after they start at Amazon. They give you a little card with five tips that you're supposed to keep on your desk about concision and specificity in the words you use. For example, you should never write the word great in an Amazon press release. You should write user friendly in X, Y, Z way and will save customers time 20 minutes each day through this."  Tactical:  Avoid subjective words like 'great'.Use concrete numbers and data points instead of adjectives.Practice strict concision by 'killing your darlings' and cutting unnecessary words to force clarity of thought.

Jeff Weinstein 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I remember writing the first draft... and he wrote back, 'This doesn't sound like you yet.' ... I rewrote it completely, and I made it sound like me, and I've tried to make things sound like me since."  Tactical:  Write internal documents in your own voice to increase clarity and ownership.

John Mark Nickels 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"The most powerful takeaway from that book for me was if it's in your head, you're screwed because it's like you're trying to keep track of stuff and be creative and come up with the future of transportation and remember to pick up something from the pharmacy. It's a recipe for disaster. This whole idea of empty mind, beginner's mind, well, you have to empty the mind of all the to-dos first. Just get that out of the head."  Tactical:  Write down every task and idea immediately to clear mental bandwidthMaintain a simple 'waiting for' list to track dependencies without mental clutter

Jules Walter 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"On the communications side, I read some stuff like Minto's Pyramid Principles. Extremely helpful... Whenever I see a great email exec update or whatever, I literally save it in a special folder."  Tactical:  Apply the Minto Pyramid Principle to structure documents logically.Maintain a 'swipe file' of excellent email templates and executive updates to reference for future writing.Prioritize clarity over complexity, as being 'wrong but clear' is often better than being ambiguous.

Julian Shapiro 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Novelty, I define, as new idea, so something I haven't heard of before, that's also significant, so it's not some trivial fact about Kim Kardashian, and it's something that I wouldn't have easily intuited on my own. When you have those ingredients, it's new, it's significant, and you wouldn't have easily thought of it on your own, that's when you trigger that dopamine hit reaction"  Tactical:  Identify points of novelty in a draft and condense the 'white space' between themUse counter-narrative information (telling people they've been lied to) to increase engagementUse 'elegant articulation' to boil complex thoughts into concise, memorable sentences    "I believe that your likelihood to follow through on something you start writing is a function of the objective you have with writing that piece and how strong your motivation is for seeing that objective to fruition... I'll pair one of those objectives that I've selected with a motivation."  Tactical:  Define the objective: Are you proving the status quo wrong or articulating what everyone is thinking?Identify the motivation: Are you solving a nagging problem or geeking out on an obsession?Use the objective as a guidepost to know exactly when the piece is finished

Julie Zhuo 3 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I approach my writing then and I still do now as letters to myself. This is the framework. This is the advice that I need to give myself that I need to go and really do better, and that is what my writing became for me, and it was hugely helpful for clarifying my train of thought."  Tactical:  Write 'letters to yourself' to clarify your own perspective on complex topicsUse writing as a tool to become more comfortable speaking up in large meetings    "I actually like word count goal even better than time goal because sometimes you can spend 30 minutes and then still just produce a sentence, and so, that was always how I approached my writing. I was like, 'All right, I'm going to sit my butt down. I'm going to write for 30 or 45 minutes, but it's going to be, whatever, like 250 words.'"  Tactical:  Set a specific daily or weekly word count goal (e.g., 500 words)Focus on 'getting the words out' first without worrying about quality or editing    "I wanted to get better at in the moment communicating more clearly and being just a little bit sharper, a little bit crisper in the points that I had to make... what if I just push myself to communicate in a much shorter form which is going to force me to really strip away all that ornamentation and focus on the core idea."  Tactical:  Practice boiling down complex advice into a numbered list or short threadUse character limits to force sharper, crisper communication

Kevin Yien 3 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Writing is clarity at scale, and a key component to a PM's job is creating clarity both internally and externally... if you can't sell or support your own product, I don't trust you to build the product. And so that's where I think writing is the foundational component there."  Tactical:  Write compelling messaging in the voice of the person you are trying to serve.Focus on internal clarity through crisp PRDs and external clarity through support/sales-ready writing.    "Good writing comes from consuming as much good writing as possible... the more you index towards developing your own taste for what you think is good by consuming others, then you can shift into producing your own and then comparing them and riffing it off other people."  Tactical:  Read writing that compels action, such as Paul Graham's essays.Avoid reading only PM artifacts; look for diverse, high-quality voices.    "I think there is a lot of value to saying, 'I need 20 minutes of focused time to interrogate something that I've done. We're not going to talk. I'm literally going to force us into a room or Zoom. You're going to read this doc, I'm going to watch you comment on it in real time.'"  Tactical:  Schedule 'silent read' meetings where the only expectation is to engage with the document.Respond to comments in real-time within the doc to move 'one clock speed faster'.

Lane Shackleton 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"The thesis is that we're in the midst of a new phase, which is essentially two-way writeups and that's where it's more conversational and feedback and discussion is actually part of the content itself... you have a done reading button at the end of a writeup... making sure that you're actually addressing the most important question... and then probably the most valuable is sentiment or pulse, which is, well, how do you feel overall about this particular proposal?"  Tactical:  Add a 'Done Reading' button to track who has consumed the content.Use an upvoted Q&A table (Dory) instead of margin comments for major questions.Include a sentiment pulse (e.g., 1-5 scale) to gauge overall team alignment.

Luc Levesque 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"It's called Smart Brevity... I've always been big on writing crisply and being very tight and not having three-page memos that you're sending off. Especially now that we're remote and we're all doing slack and email and different ways of messaging, how tightly you communicate, how crisp your communication is really important."  Tactical:  Adopt 'Smart Brevity' principles to make internal memos and messages scannableAvoid long-form memos in favor of tight, high-impact communication that respects the reader's time

"OpenAI has such a slack heavy culture and it really... The instantaneous real time communication on Slack is so crucial. And I just love being able to tag in different people from different teams and get everybody coalesced."  Tactical:  Use real-time messaging to coalesce teams faster than walking to a desk or scheduling a meeting.Encourage tagging cross-functional stakeholders in public channels to maintain transparency and speed.

"When you write something, read it out loud, literally just read the thing you wrote out loud and half the time you'll realize it's way too complicated... Just say that thing. The thing that you said to me in conversation is the thing you should write."  Tactical:  Read your drafts out loud to identify over-complicationWrite exactly what you would say in a conversation rather than using 'business' prose    "The Minto principle is something that I would recommend everyone do, which is put the headline, the full conclusion first and then you're supporting argument second."  Tactical:  Use the Minto Pyramid Principle: conclusion first, supporting data secondDelete the first two paragraphs of most documents as they are usually unnecessaryLimit conclusions or next steps to a maximum of three items

Matt Abrahams 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"The structure that almost everybody listening in is familiar with is one that comes from the world of advertising. Most advertisements are set up as problem, solution, benefit. There's some problem in the world, here's how we solve it with our product or service, and here's how you benefit from it."  Tactical:  Frame communications by first identifying a problem, then the solution, then the specific benefit    "I really like is a three-question structure: What? So what? Now what? ... What is your product, your service, your offering, your update, your feedback? ... The so what is why is this important and relevant ... And then the now what is what comes next."  Tactical:  Define the 'What' (the facts or the update)Explain the 'So What' (the relevance and importance)Detail the 'Now What' (the next steps or call to action)

"I have CEOs write two-pagers on where did the company come from? How is it different today? What are our external treats to our market? What's our competition? How do you view our competition? What should we care about? What should we not care about?"  Tactical:  Draft a two-page strategy memo covering vision, market positioning, competition, and prioritized strategic intents.Use Google Docs or a Wiki to link strategy documents across different levels (executive, director, team).

"Can I make a presentation I can just circulate on email and everyone gets it? Well, that's called a slide doc. You put more words, you put stronger picture... everything they need to see your thinking, it follows behind it."  Tactical:  Write in full sentences and prose for documents intended to be read without a presenterUse a dense appendix to show the full depth of thinkingUse slide docs as an alternative to the Amazon-style six-page memo

Noah Weiss 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I actually think especially as you get to more senior positions, writing is the only scalable way of having influence on a larger, larger product org... It's the antidote to that to scale your ability to influence the product direction and maybe even the principles and how you develop product at a company."  Tactical:  Study 'On Writing' by Stephen King to improve production volume and quality.Use writing to influence the 'teams of teams' that you cannot meet with daily.

"I've actually put a lot of effort in this idea of institutional learning, of doing the quarterly meeting of the most surprising experiments. ... Document it. We had a large deck internally of these successes and failures, and we encourage people to look at them. The other thing that's very beneficial is just to have your whole history of experiments and do some ability to search by keywords."  Tactical:  Document both successful and failed experiments in a central deck or databaseEnable keyword searching across historical experiments for easy retrieval    "I took that to heart. And many of the features that the team presented instead of a PowerPoint, you start off with a structured document that tells you what you need, the questions you need to answer for your idea. And then we review them as a team."  Tactical:  Use a structured document template that requires answering specific questions about a proposed ideaReview documents as a team to ensure feedback is captured and persists after the meeting

Wes Kao 8 quotes

Listen to episode →

"The idea of the super specific how is that most writers, most course instructors spend too much time on the what and the why and not enough time on how. So if you think about people who are reading your writing, most of them probably already agree with the general premise of what you're saying."  Tactical:  Minimize time spent on the general premise or context.Focus on the specific steps, nuances, and examples of how to apply an idea.    "I have a framework that I call start right before you get eaten by the bear. And the idea is that if you're telling a story about camping, don't start talking about going to REI to buy a Patagonia jacket... Start right before your friend left a Clif Bar out in their tent and you all almost got mauled by a bear. Get to the juicy part."  Tactical:  Cut out the backstory and context-setting 'scope creep'.Start your story or document at the most critical or 'juicy' moment.    "more people should learn the craft of writing and the technical aspects of writing, not just look at what other people are doing to try to get audience engagement, but to actually improve your ability to precisely say what you mean and convey the level of conviction that you have and not accidentally mislead people with your words"  Tactical:  Study the technical craft of sentence structure and logic.Be intentional about whether you are leading the reader to a conclusion or presenting objective data.    "in business, you often want to start with here's my conclusion, and then here's why, versus here's all the things I've done, here's all my thinking, here's all my data points, and then now here's my conclusion at the end of that."  Tactical:  Place the recommendation or conclusion at the very top of the document or message.Separate the 'FYI' context from the specific action items or decisions required.    "Being concise is not about absolute word count, it's about economy of words. It's about the density of the insight that you're sharing. And so you can have a 300 word memo that's meandering and long-winded and a thousand word memo that is tight and concise."  Tactical:  Focus on the 'density' of insights rather than just making the text shorterIdentify your 'core point' or 'the lead' before you start cutting    "I think the blast radius of a poorly written memo is way bigger than most people think. If you are just shooting off a message in a Slack channel with 15 other people, and it's confusing, you didn't include information you should have included, there's going to be a bunch of back and forth."  Tactical:  Take an extra 30 seconds to reread and clean up messages before sendingEnsure all necessary information is included to prevent follow-up questions    "Signposting is using certain words, phrases, formatting, and an overall structure in your writing that helps guide your reader and signals what is coming in the rest of the post."  Tactical:  Use phrases like 'for example', 'because', and 'as a next step' to signal intentKick off paragraphs with 'First, second, third' to create structure without heavy formatting    "I also dislike when people overuse bullets and sentence fragments, phrases in bullets when they should use complete sentences that actually show the connected tissue between ideas, that show the logical flow of what it is that you're saying."  Tactical:  Turn bullet fragments into full sentences to test if the idea is fully thought outAvoid excessive bolding (more than 30% of a note) to maintain the impact of highlights

"Clarity comes when you write. So I made them write two-page documents. I'll let you go up to four, maybe. But two page documents with insights, your strategy or I use the word approach sometimes and then the big rocks."

"I really believe in frameworks for things that helps drive extreme clarity. I work on a lot of different projects. A lot of times I'm ramping up a new project, I'm like, "Where can I learn what I need to learn about this project?" I ask five different people, get five different answers. That is unacceptable. Of course, I'm sure there's hundreds of docs associated with the project, but there needs to be one canonical doc."  Tactical:  Create one canonical doc for every projectEnsure the doc links to all other associated documents    "I never use bulleted lists because you can never refer to a bullet. I always use numbered lists because you can always in the visual in a meeting as referenced in number two, I have feedback on that, versus the third bullet, two up from the second, whatever, that is not extreme clarity."  Tactical:  Replace bulleted lists with numbered lists in all documents and presentations    "Everyone should know exactly where the canonical doc is. That's the one place I can go to get all the information I need about a project and it will link to all the other docs... The basic information that you need to know is what are the discrete areas of work, I call those work streams... Who are the owners on those work streams?"  Tactical:  Define discrete work streams in the project docAssign a single-threaded owner (STO) to every work streamList canonical meetings, email lists, and chat channels in the doc

"Language actually affects the way you think... when I make slide decks...

"I feel really strongly that you can write a lot more if you write what you want to write... the biggest strength of writing what you want is you get to write where there's energy and you don't have to write where there's no energy, which takes you really, really negative."  Tactical:  Write about topics that directly relate to your current work to refine your thinkingGive up on projects where the energy has dissipated rather than forcing them    "If your goal is to write a lot consistently over time, my biggest advice would be just publish. And so there's a lot of people out there with stuff that hundreds of drafts and they've not published anything. And my thing is I publish almost everything I write."  Tactical:  Don't start writing something if you don't intend to publish itIgnore 'silly feedback' from the internet to maintain the psychological safety to keep publishing
