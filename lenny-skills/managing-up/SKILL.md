Managing Up  Managing up isn't political maneuvering—it's making your manager's job easier while advancing your own goals. Your manager is a resource with authority and context that can accelerate your work. The most senior people in organizations are consistently the best at managing up—that's often how they got there.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 35 experts.

1 Understand your manager's priorities (and their manager's)  Effective managing up requires understanding what your manager is optimizing for and how your work fits into the bigger picture. Go two levels up: know your boss's priorities and your boss's boss's priorities. This lets you align your work with what actually matters and identify opportunities to take things off their plate.

Featured guest perspectives

"I call this going two stack levels up, two stack levels down in terms of your curiosity and what you understand... you should understand your boss's priorities and your boss's boss's priorities. Eventually, that means you have to know what the board is thinking."

— Fareed Mosavat    "A lot of times I think there is a big disconnect between an IC focusing on their discrete area and try to optimize for local maxima, versus understanding, okay, my manager's thinking about these things and this is how I fit in."

— Bangaly Kaba        2 Proactively keep them informed  Executives appear out of touch because teams fail to communicate upward. Don't wait to be asked—send structured weekly updates. A simple format works: current priorities, blockers needing help, and things on your mind. Mark updates as 'no response required' to keep leaders informed without creating burden.

Featured guest perspectives

"I sent my manager a state of Lenny email every week, just titled the state of Lenny. And it had basically three sections, my priorities currently, blockers that I need their help with... and then just things on my mind currently that week."

— Wes Kao    "We actually used to have a format for that we called HPMs. Highlight, people, me. And every manager at Facebook from like 2008 to like 2014 would send to their manager, or even their leadership group."

— Boz        3 Bring recommendations, not just problems  When you bring a problem without a recommendation, you're putting all the cognitive load on your manager. Instead, come with a point of view: 'Here's what I think we should do and why.' Even if your hunch is wrong, it gives them something to react to and shows you've thought it through.

Featured guest perspectives

"When you just ask your manager, 'Hey manager, what should we do?' You're putting a lot of cognitive load on your manager to need to think about the problem, think about potential solutions, craft the solution, and then tell you what to do. Whereas if you instead said, 'Hey manager, here's what I think we should do.'"

— Wes Kao        4 Leverage your manager as a resource  Your primary job is to achieve results, and your manager has tools and authority you don't. The most common advice successful leaders give is to more directly leverage your superiors. Ask for help bulldozing blockers, making introductions, or clearing organizational obstacles. That's what they're there for.

Featured guest perspectives

"The advice I find I have to give more frequently than any other in my career, as a manager, a board member, an advisor and a friend, is for people to more directly leverage their leaders."

— Boz    "As having a founder that can effectively operate in founder mode means that I can go and have a conversation with the CEO and say, 'Hey, look, we have this huge opportunity and these are the things that aren't working, and I need your help to help figure out how we can move the needle more substantially.'"

— Anneka Gupta        5 Start with the strategy, not the details  When communicating upward, start with 'Chapter 1'—the company strategy and metrics you're working on—before diving into the specific work ('Chapter 6'). Executives need context to evaluate your decisions. Find the last point in your story that's completely obvious to the audience and build from there.

Featured guest perspectives

"One of the ways I try to frame it to my team is if you're not an executive, whatever you're working on, you're basically writing and telling a story. And when you talk to an exec about that story, you have to start with chapter one, which is what part of the company strategy are you working on? What metrics are you trying to improve?"

— Casey Winters        6 Push back effectively by aligning on the 'spirit'  When you need to challenge a leader's idea, don't just say no. First, acknowledge the underlying goal—the 'spirit' of what they're trying to achieve. Then present alternative solutions that better serve that goal with data and strategic thinking. You're not rejecting their vision; you're finding a better path to it.

Featured guest perspectives

"It's understanding the spirit of what they're trying to achieve. Being able to go back with, 'Hey, I understand the spirit. The spirit is that we're trying to get people who previously didn't consider Airbnb before to come and use Airbnb, but the right way to do it is not this very time-intensive, cost-intensive way...' It's coming back with actual options."

— Jiaona Zhang    "If you come with data, if you run a secret experiment and you come back and you show them you usually get one of two results. Either they get extremely mad at you... But the more common case is they're pleasantly surprised."

— Itamar Gilad

✗ Common Mistakes

Under-communicating upward and then complaining that executives are out of touchAsking 'What should we do?' instead of 'Here's what I think we should do'Trying to make your boss look dumb in public rather than raising concerns privatelyNot tailoring communication to individual executives' styles and concerns     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Your manager rarely needs to ask for status updates—you've already sent themYou're getting opportunities and exposure beyond your current roleYour manager sees you as an ally who makes their job easierWhen you push back on ideas, leaders engage rather than dismiss

"The underlying dynamic that must be true in any organization on a fundamental basis is you can't make your boss look dumb because if you do, they're the person who decides, 'Oh, this person's not performing,' or whatever. And that one little asymmetry, that one little fact... is what leads to the systemic compounding thing where you get these really weird dysfunctional emergent things that everybody hates."  Tactical:  Acknowledge 'organizational kayfabe'—the things everyone pretends are true—to navigate the system without being 'knocked out of the game.'Find ways to introduce disconfirming evidence that doesn't feel like an existential threat to leadership.

"With Max, I also wrote a parallel document of hot takes. So once a quarter or so for the first year, I'd write a document that was just like, hey, for sake of provocation, if we wanted to fundamentally change a few things, here's ideas on what we could fundamentally change."  Tactical:  During onboarding, write a list of themes and observations to build credibility.Create a 'hot takes' document to spark discussion on fundamental changes with the executive team.

Tactical:  Activate the CEO as an ally to push initiatives that require high-level power to move the needle.When a founder pushes a 'pet project,' identify the underlying objective and suggest alternative options that meet that goal more effectively.

"A lot of times I think there is a big disconnect between an IC focusing on their discrete area and try to optimize for local maxima, versus understanding, okay, my manager's thinking about these things and this is how I fit in, and understanding maybe they have a gap to understanding why your area is important."  Tactical:  Identify what your manager is currently optimizing for and find synergies with your own remit.Take on adjacent tasks that are on your manager's plate to alleviate their burden and increase your scope.

"The advice I find I have to give more frequently than any other in my career, as a manager, a board member, an advisor and a friend, is for people to more directly leverage their leaders."  Tactical:  Ask for help to bulldoze blockers rather than trying to solve everything yourself.Frame updates as 'no response required' to keep leaders informed without creating a burden.Provide a 'heartbeat' or 'ping' to your manager so they have a mental model of your progress.    "We actually used to have a format for that we called HPMs. Highlight, people, me. And every manager at Facebook from like 2008 to like 2014 would send to their manager, or even their leadership group."  Tactical:  Use the HPM (Highlight, People, Me) framework for weekly updates.Ask your manager directly: 'How do you like to get information about me?'    "Mark's voracious for all information and all points of view... you'll give him feedback, he listens... over the course of the next week or two, you'll just see shifts."  Tactical:  Take the long view when giving feedback to senior leaders; they may pressure-test your input with others before acting.Be direct with concerns, but deliver them with a belief that the situation can be improved.

"I find that in general people just way under communicate upward inside of companies. And then they'll complain that executives are out of touch when they aren't telling executives what the executives need to know."  Tactical:  Escalate issues early so leaders can help change the circumstances rather than just dealing with themCommunicate explicit trade-offs to ensure leaders can evaluate results with the proper context    "One of the ways I try to frame it to my team is if you're not an executive, whatever you're working on, you're basically writing and telling a story. And when you talk to an exec about that story, you have to start with chapter one, which is what part of the company strategy are you working on? What metrics are you trying to improve? What assumptions are you making that are guiding what you're building?"  Tactical:  Start presentations with the company strategy and metrics before discussing specific featuresFind the last point in your story that is completely obvious to the audience and build from there    "Something I commonly say is that executive communication is actually executives communication. You're communicating with individual executives that all have different styles and different concerns about the business or about the particular problem you're working on."  Tactical:  Anticipate the specific questions a CFO vs. a CEO will ask and weave answers into the early part of the storyAssume executive questions are a desire to learn rather than a test of your knowledge

"The most powerful way I have found to get trust with many people is to have them accountable for an outcome of mine, which is to know. So if I wanted to accelerate trust with Lenny, I will ask Lenny to teach me."  Tactical:  Identify the most influential or 'loudest' person in the organization and ask them to mentor you.Volunteer to 'intern' or shadow a leader to learn what drives their influence.By having a leader teach you, you effectively extend their internal trust to yourself.

"Brian assumed everybody else was going to work at the same pace and duration... His point of view is like, 'Hey, we're having a meeting in the office tonight at 10 o'clock. Be there.'"  Tactical:  Recognize when a founder's workaholism is one-dimensionalBe prepared to push back on unreasonable meeting times if they don't align with your career stage    "I was mentoring Brian on leadership, but he was also my boss... It required me to have a certain amount of humility as well as to be reporting to a guy 21 years younger than me, Brian."  Tactical:  Don't pretend to know things you don't knowShow respect to earn it in returnAdopt a 'wise and curious' mindset    "I would say, 'Lenny, let's do a little pep talk, you and me before the meeting.'

Let's get really clear... on what both, what's the intention of this iteration that we're doing on the product? What defines success, and what do I want to get accomplished in this meeting?'"  Tactical:  Set alignment on the front end of every meetingDefine what success looks like for the specific meetingUse the agreed-upon goals to redirect the conversation if the founder becomes 'combustible'    "I always wanted to really limit the deck as much as possible, because I didn't know where the meeting was going to go. I wanted the decks helpful at the start, at the very start, to just set principles, set goals."  Tactical:  Limit the number of slides in your presentationUse decks primarily for setting principles and goals at the start

"I think I was just willing to take some risks and really push for the things that I believed made sense even though maybe based on the titles that I had at the time, I wasn't sort of inherently given a seat at the table and really pushed my away into some of these conversations and then was eventually invited to them."  Tactical:  Push for a seat at the table by having a well-formed perspective on business-level problemsWiden your aperture beyond immediate execution to understand how different parts of the business connect    "we ran into the COO at the time and out of the blue I think he had asked us what we thought about pricing and packaging... we ended up kind of pitching in the midst of pints being sort of handed every which way you could turn this vision for a completely different way we might approach pricing and packaging, and he was pretty intrigued and he said, 'Why don't you come to the next executive meeting and pitch us on it?'"  Tactical:  Have a 'ready-to-go' pitch for major business levers like pricing and packagingUse informal settings to test contrarian ideas with leadership

"Management can be a lonely job, because you feel like you're responsible for everything. So having an ally, it's just a huge weight off people's shoulders. And I think a lot about social engineering. The social engineering's here is just the simple, 'You help me, I'll help you.'"  Tactical:  Recognize that managers are often overwhelmed and appreciate proactive supportMove from asking 'How can I help?' to suggesting specific solutions as you gain seniorityKeep your leader in the loop by proactively identifying and fixing problems before they ask

"After a little bit of that, I was like, 'It might be easier if I just go, I might be able save you some time and some energy if I just joined you.' And it was a way that I took myself into this higher level meeting, framing it as something that was going to help out my boss. And it did. It wasn't dishonest, but it was a pretty effective way of advocating to get into this meeting."

"It shifted the pushback of like, 'We can't build this thing, it's too many features, we don't have enough time, we don't have enough resources' to, 'Oh, we all want a really elegant, really smooth, slick experience for our customers. How do we do that? What's a trip design or a new concept that is actually going to elevate things?'... It wasn't about saying no. It was about understanding what we're all actually sharing as a goal which was a great simple customer experience and then actually building that."  Tactical:  Identify the specific 'big idea' or 'end state' the leader is excited about (e.g., 'winning' or 'magical experience').Pitch your scope changes or alternative plans as the superior way to reach that specific end state.

The way to do it is to be much more granular in what we ask people when they upload their home and more checks in that. And that could be automated and through technology as opposed to through humans.' It's coming back with actual options."

"You print out your calendar or you show it to them on your screen, and you say, 'Hey boss, I need 10 minutes with you, Monday morning. Is that okay? Can I get 10 minutes with you?' And now, what you're going to do is you're going to show them your time box calendar for your working hours. You're going to say, 'Okay, boss, you see here's my time for email. Here's my time for that meeting you asked me to go to. Here's time for that big project I'm working on. Now, you see this other piece of paper? Okay, you see this other list here? This is a list of things you've asked me to do that I'm having trouble fitting into my calendar.'"  Tactical:  Perform 'schedule syncing' by showing your manager your time-boxed calendar.Ask your manager to help prioritize tasks that don't fit into the current schedule.Avoid the advice of just saying 'no'; instead, ask for help with trade-offs.

"The first is, I think as much as possible... is getting to the point where you have alignment on the principles for what it means to build a great product of that company. Not just about if the intuition and tasting gut, but how do you distill that to principles that become the language of the company so that everybody else can start thinking through a similar frame or similar lens when you're designing a product."  Tactical:  Distill founder intuition into written principles.Use these principles to avoid 'Goldilocks' reviews where teams guess what the founder wants.    "I think when to involve the founder CEO in a project is really important. The short version I think that works the best is almost like a U-curve where the X-axis is time and the Y-axis is level of involvement. I think you want to get the founder CEO really involved early on, especially if it's a big new project, to make sure that there's strategic buy-in... Then I think at the very end you want them to really be bought in that did you build something that's up to the quality... of the company?"  Tactical:  Involve founders early for strategic buy-in on goals and anti-goals.Bring founders back at the end to 'taste the soup' and ensure the product meets the brand's quality bar.

But in that moment I was just like, 'This is how I will do better work. This is how I will get better support.'"

"I think CMO is a very, very hard role. And also, I think it's a role that is very hard to do without a lot of trust, and without a deep connection to the founding team. Everything you do in marketing is very visible, and you're kind of touching something that matters so deeply to the founding team."  Tactical:  Build trust by demonstrating a deep understanding of the product and the market before attempting radical brand changes.

Ravi Mehta 2 quotes

"I think oftentimes people refrain from giving feedback when they feel like that feedback is going to be intrusive. So just inviting your manager to say, 'Look, I'm really looking to level up. Please give me feedback whenever you see something. You can give it to me in real time. Don't worry about wordsmithing it.'"  Tactical:  Explicitly ask for real-time, unpolished feedback to increase the quantity of insights you receive.Reward your manager for giving feedback by responding enthusiastically, even if the feedback is difficult to hear.    "As someone who's working with a manager, there's kind of two things that you're constantly solving for. One is the degree to which you're aligned with your manager, and the second is the degree to which your manager has confidence in you."  Tactical:  If you lack alignment, focus on building confidence through small wins to earn the right to take a different path.Map your relationship on a 2x2 of Alignment vs. Confidence to understand your current influence.

Tactical:  Define the spectrum of your interest in a topic (FYI vs. Opinionated vs. Decision-maker).Articulate the logic tree behind your opinions so others can attempt to prove you wrong.

If I had to go back and do it again, I think I would spend maybe more time investing and illuminating that aspect of the digital universe."  Tactical:  Use historical industry data to ground executive expectationsHighlight the improbability of 'best-case' scenarios in distribution models    "I take the job full knowing that it's going to be wildly different than Pandora... in the context of Snapchat, at best, I was going to be Evan's right hand, a person that principally executed his vision."

Wes Kao 5 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I think that most people assume that their boss has to manage them and they feel a little bit resentful that, why should I manage my boss? They're getting paid more. They are my manager. They have more responsibility. And you can continue to think that way and your career might be fine, but if you embrace that if you manage your boss, they're going to appreciate you much more, you're going to get more opportunities, you're going to have more trust with them, there's all these great things that happen when you decide to manage up."  Tactical:  Shift your mindset from resentment to proactive partnership with your manager.Focus on building trust by taking responsibilities off your manager's plate.    "the most senior people are best at managing up. This is why they got promoted in the first place because they were great at managing up to their bosses to understand what was worrying their bosses, what was keeping them up at night so that they could take that off their plate. They're great at keeping their bosses in the loop on what's happening so their bosses, aren't constantly having to ask and pepper them with questions every day"  Tactical:  Identify what is 'keeping your boss up at night' and proactively address those issues.Communicate status updates before your manager has to ask for them.    "proactively giving the right amount of context for your manager to be able to weigh in on what you're doing and to be able to give feedback, I think that's super, super important. And then thinking about the right level of context to give them, is this a reversible decision or is this one that is irreversible or difficult to reverse or expensive to reverse?"  Tactical:  Categorize decisions as reversible or irreversible to determine how much context to provide.Share your rationale and thought process so the manager can provide targeted feedback.    "I sent my manager a state of Lenny email every week, just titled the state of Lenny. And it had basically three sections, my priorities currently, blockers that I need their help with, and maybe that was the first thing that I put up just to make sure that they saw that, and then just things on my mind currently that week."  Tactical:  Send a weekly 'state of' email to your manager.Include three sections: current priorities, blockers needing help, and general thoughts.    "When you just ask your manager, 'Hey manager, what should we do?' You're putting a lot of cognitive load on your manager to need to think about the problem, think about potential solutions, craft the solution, and then tell you what to do. Whereas if you instead said, 'Hey manager, here's what I think we should do.'"  Tactical:  Present a point of view (POV) even if it's just an initial hunchProvide insights and takeaways when sharing reports rather than just raw data

"Dylan is very based on intuition and instinct... part of my job is to build out that logic streak for him of how did you arrive at that conclusion so that people can understand that at scale, in a way. But he's very much about that. Or I think there's a way which, sometimes, it's a product manager, you want to lay out a problem and say, okay, we're going to first focus on this problem, and then [inaudible 00:29:21] these three approaches. We're going to take this approach and have a review at every step along the way. But for Dylan, I think, it's very hard for him to really fully get bought into it until he sees the end implementation to viscerally feel if this is a good solution or not."  Tactical:  Build a 'logic streak' to support or explain a leader's intuitionProvide high-fidelity end-state visualizations for leaders who need to 'see it to feel it'Contain 'founder madness' by creating structured channels for their ad-hoc feedback

"I think the more concrete an artifact is or the more you can debate something, the better. I ask for examples a lot, I try to ask follow up questions about things and make sure I fully understand it. And I think where I get stuck sometimes is if I ask follow up questions and we don't have answers yet, and then my response might be, 'Let's go find the answer to these questions and then let's go back to this conversation', if I think it's something that's really important."
