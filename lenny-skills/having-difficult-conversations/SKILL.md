Having Difficult Conversations  Difficult conversations are the highest-leverage moments in leadership. Avoiding them creates organizational dysfunction, destroys team morale, and causes you to lose your best performers. The goal isn't to minimize discomfort—it's to deliver truth in a way that creates clarity and enables growth.

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 43 experts.

1 Reframe candor as kindness  Being 'nice' by avoiding hard feedback isn't kind—it's selfish. You're optimizing for your own comfort while letting someone fail. True kindness means telling people what they need to hear to improve, even when it's uncomfortable. The long-term damage from withholding feedback is always worse than the short-term discomfort of delivering it.

Featured guest perspectives

"Fundamentally, the most selfish thing you can do is withhold feedback from someone. When you think a thought that would help someone improve and you avoid giving it to them because it would make you uncomfortable. Well, you're optimizing for your own comfort, and it's fundamentally selfish."

— Matt MacInnis    "The number one company value from my startup... was to be kind and candid... we, as founders, realized that we often would be nice and it wasn't actually the right thing to do. We would delay the difficult conversations and we were not candid... think of being candid as an act of kindness."

— Alexander Embiricos        2 Use a structured feedback framework  Structure prevents feedback from becoming personal attacks. Use a formula like: 'When you [specific behavior], I feel [actual emotion], and I'm telling you this because [purpose/what you want to change].' Stay on your side of the net—speak only to the behavior you observed and its impact on you, not to the other person's intentions or character.

Featured guest perspectives

"The formula is when you do insert behavior, I feel pull out the vocabulary of feelings and I'm telling you this because, or I'm hoping the outcome of you knowing this is."

— Carole Robin    "Stay on your side of the net... stick with the two realities you know because we get in trouble the minute we start thinking we know the other person's reality."

— Carole Robin    "Convey this feedback as situation, behavior, impact. The situation is on Tuesday in that meeting at 3:00. Behavior, you interrupted me while I was saying this thing. Impact, made me feel like you weren't listening to me."

— Paige Costello        3 Address issues while they're still small  Small interpersonal irritations ('pinches') left unaddressed become major conflicts ('crunches'). Notice when you're becoming activated by small behaviors and address them immediately. The conversation that feels awkward today becomes much harder after resentment has compounded for months.

Featured guest perspectives

"Address it while it's still small and then it won't get big. That's why we call it talk about a pinch before it becomes a crunch."

— Carole Robin    "Feedback really, in my mind, ideally, should be a daily practice... what is the best tool for us to get better? It is feedback."

— Julie Zhuo        4 Give a heads-up before delivering hard news  The amygdala gets triggered by surprise. Before delivering difficult feedback or news, warn the person: 'This is going to be a difficult conversation. Take a few seconds to prepare yourself.' This simple heads-up prevents emotional hijacking and helps the recipient actually hear what you're saying.

Featured guest perspectives

"I start it off, 'Hey, this is going to be a difficult conversation. I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself. You are not going to enjoy this.' What I found is that the way the amygdala gets triggered is often because of surprise. So, if you give someone just a few seconds to mentally prepare, then the amygdala often doesn't get triggered nearly as hard."

— Matt Mochary        5 Be crystal clear about consequences  Before any termination, you must have had a 'crystal clear' conversation where the stakes were explicitly stated. Say exactly what needs to change, by when, and what happens if it doesn't. Use language like 'If you don't fix these things in the next 30 days, we're going to have to part ways.' No one should be surprised when they're let go.

Featured guest perspectives

"I need you to know that this is very important. I need you to fix this within the next 30 days. Otherwise, I'm sorry to say, we're going to have to find a way to part ways because I can't keep this going with you. I know you have it in you to change. I value all you bring to the table, but if you don't fix these things, we're not going to have a future together."

— Alisa Cohn    "Where if I'm asking myself the question, 'If this person on my team came to me and said, "I'm leaving today. I have a different opportunity," would I do everything I could to keep them at Netflix?' If not, then I should be having that tough conversation about, 'Should you really be here? Are you in the right role?'"

— Elizabeth Stone        6 Respond to defensiveness with curiosity, not escalation  When someone pushes back on feedback, don't double down or retreat. Instead, respond with genuine curiosity: 'Fascinating. Tell me more about why you think that.' If the energy changes and they become heated, pause and reset: 'I notice the energy has changed. My intention isn't to upset you—I want to help you succeed.' Ask 'What did you hear me say?' to uncover misinterpretations.

Featured guest perspectives

"She could have the most profound disagreement with somebody in the world... and she would respond. She would say, 'Fascinating. You have to tell me more about why you think that.'"

— Boz    "Let's pause for a second because I'm feeling the energy has changed and I can see that you're getting a little bit heated by what I'm saying and I want you to know that I have no intention of upsetting you. I just want to be able to talk to you about the things that are going to help you in your career."

— Alisa Cohn    "What did you hear me say? One of the most powerful things you can do when somebody responds in a way that feels very unexpected and out of whack with what you just said is go back to, 'What did you hear me say?'"

— Carole Robin

✗ Common Mistakes

Saying 'I feel that...' or 'I feel like...'—these introduce attributions about the other person, not actual feelingsBurying the lead—deliver the hard news early, don't make them wait through contextUsing feedback as emotional venting rather than strategic behavior changeFailing to create consequences, which makes feedback just noiseFiring someone who is surprised because you never had the 'crystal clear' conversation     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

People thank you for feedback even when it's hard to hearIssues get resolved before they escalate into major conflictsYour team gives you honest feedback in returnWhen you do have to let someone go, they understand why and it doesn't come as a shock

"It's so unsafe for your manager to turn to a young woman on the team and say, 'Here, let me give you feedback on your physical appearance, and how it affects your competence and how you're perceived in the workforce.' That the vast majority of them will just never do it because there's no winning... but then that person never learns the rules of the game."  Tactical:  Connect the dots for the recipient between their presentation/behavior and how it affects their perceived competence.Focus feedback on controllable elements that can be actioned immediately.Build deep trust first so that 'Radical Candor' is received as helpful rather than an attack.

"Hope for the future is so important. I know this is going to be challenging for you to hear, not going to promote you, but I want you to know this. It's really important to me that you're able to succeed in your career here, and so I want to continue to help you find opportunities to build your skills and to advance."  Tactical:  Acknowledge the difficulty of the news immediatelyExpress commitment to the employee's long-term career successOffer specific support for skill-building and advancement    "No one wants to make anybody upset, but through that upset on the other side of that, can often be a whole new possibility and a whole new revelation, and actually a lot of joy and freedom. I think that we forget about all the other possibilities that come out of difficult conversations and we just land on these really uncomfortable parts."  Tactical:  Identify the specific fear or meaning you are attaching to the conversationFocus on the potential positive outcomes and 'freedom' on the other side of the conflict    "Matilda, I want to chat with you about the way you're interacting with your peers. So what I'm hearing from them is that you're missing deadlines on a regular basis and not letting them know you're missing the deadlines, and that also you're not fully keeping your team up to speed. And so they're kind of confused running around. Now, we both know that the most important way you can be successful here and also achieve your goals is to make sure that you are working with your peers in a way that's consistent and that they can count on you and you can count on them."  Tactical:  Use the phrase 'What I'm hearing' to cite multiple sources of feedbackUse 'We both know' to align the feedback with the employee's own goals for successKeep the tone even-keeled and matter-of-fact    "Matilda, part of your job is to be able to create these documents and I appreciate that you do them on time. What I've observed is that they can often be not as structured as I'd like them to be and they also lack a conclusion. So what I'd love you to do is look at these three or four examples of some folks who are doing them really well and see if you can model your writing on theirs."  Tactical:  Start with 'What I've observed' to keep the feedback objectiveProvide specific examples of high-quality work to serve as a benchmarkConnect the skill level to the perception of their professional thinking    "Let's pause for a second because I'm feeling the energy has changed and I can see that you're getting a little bit heated by what I'm saying and I want you to know that I have no intention of upsetting you. I just want to be able to talk to you about the things that are going to help you in your career."  Tactical:  Call out the change in 'energy' or 'temperature' neutrallyReiterate that the goal is to help the person's careerOffer a break to digest the information if necessary    "Matilda, I know this is going to be challenging for you to hear. I know you were hoping to get that promotion, but I want to let you know that we are going to actually be looking for an external candidate. I want to give you a few thoughts about why. First of all, in discussing this with my peers, I'm realizing that we need someone who has done this role multiple times in the past and has that experience."  Tactical:  Don't 'bury the lead'—deliver the news early in the meetingExplain the business rationale (e.g., need for specialized external experience)Mirror back their perspective to show they have been heard    "I need you to know that this is very important. I need you to fix this within the next 30 days. Otherwise, I'm sorry to say, we're going to have to find a way to part ways because I can't keep this going with you. I know you have it in you to change. I value all you bring to the table, but if you don't fix these things, we're not going to have a future together."  Tactical:  State clearly that the issue is a 'deal breaker'Set a specific timeframe for improvement (e.g., 30 days)Explicitly use the phrase 'part ways' or 'not have a future together' so there is no ambiguity    "Matilda, we talked about this multiple times. The last time we had this conversation, I told you I needed you to make these changes. You haven't made these changes and we're going to part ways. So I have here, Sarah from HR or whatever, and we're going to talk through the logistics of that."  Tactical:  Reference the previous 'crystal clear' warningsState the decision as final and move quickly to logisticsInvolve HR for the formal termination process

"I hear what you're saying and I understand. Nevertheless, this is what's going to happen. And obviously, the words that you can use for that might be different... I heard you and your input, trust me, was incorporated into the decision, nevertheless, this is the path we're going to take."  Tactical:  Validate the other person's perspective ('I hear you').Use 'nevertheless' to transition to the final decision without inviting further debate.

"I try to let myself just feel the things that I'm going to feel. ... Then once that's passed, whether that's a few hours or a few days, don't react. Don't try to say, "Oh, I don't believe this." Listen. And then ask myself, okay, well where is this feedback coming from? Why am I getting this feedback?"  Tactical:  Wait several hours or days before responding to negative feedback to allow emotions to settle.Approach feedback with curiosity by asking peers for additional context or flavor on the critique.    "I will say this very directly to people, I care so much about you and I'm giving you this feedback because I want you to be successful and I want you to be able to reach the pinnacle of what I know you can accomplish. ... then it makes the other person much more receptive to hearing whatever you have to say."  Tactical:  Explicitly state your positive intent and belief in the person's potential before delivering the critique.Frame feedback as 'how you are being perceived' rather than an objective truth about the person's character.

"I'd say I just sit them down and I would say, 'Look, you're a really good director of engineering because you do a great job at managing the team, get the products out, all that. But you're not really a CTO because to be a CTO, you have to be effective with other parts of the organization... if you want to get good at that, I'll help you. I'll work with you on it, but if you don't, I'm going to have to hire a CTO at some point because obviously I need that.'"  Tactical:  Be specific about how a behavior (e.g., making someone cry) reduces professional effectivenessOffer a path to improvement while being clear about the consequences of not changing    "you've got to be able to tell them the truth in a way that you probably don't tell most of your friends the truth... all the most important things I've said are things that I've said to CEOs that they did not want to hear. And that's what the leadership is about."  Tactical:  Prioritize being respectful over being 'friendly' when delivering hard truthsFocus on the long-term health of the company rather than immediate social comfort

"Being kind isn't that. Being kind is like, 'Hey, how can I deliver this feedback in a way that is actually productive and helpful, in a way that is going to help them and not cause them just to feel bad and helpless?'"  Tactical:  Distinguish between 'nice' (patronizing/half-truths) and 'kind' (direct/helpful feedback).Recognize when 'identity threat' is making you defensive during a disagreement.    "She could have the most profound disagreement with somebody in the world... and she would respond. She would say, 'Fascinating. You have to tell me more about why you think that.'"  Tactical:  Use the phrase 'Fascinating, tell me more' when you encounter a viewpoint that seems 'crazy wrong'.Embrace curiosity as a tool to bridge the 'schism' between different mental models.

"I feel that you don't care and I feel you're being insensitive are not feelings, and that's where we make our biggest mistakes when it comes to feedback."  Tactical:  Avoid using 'I feel that' or 'I feel like' as they usually lead to attributions rather than emotions.Use a specific vocabulary of feelings (e.g., hurt, afraid, disappointed) to express impact.    "Stay on your side of the net... stick with the two realities you know because we get in trouble the minute we start thinking we know the other person's reality."  Tactical:  Only speak to the behavior you observed and the impact it had on you.Avoid assuming the other person's motives or intentions.    "The formula is when you do insert behavior, I feel pull out the vocabulary of feelings and I'm telling you this because, or I'm hoping the outcome of you knowing this is."  Tactical:  State the specific behavior: 'When you do [X]...'State the feeling: 'I feel [Y]...'State the purpose: 'I'm telling you this because [Z]...'    "Address it while it's still small and then it won't get big. That's why we call it talk about a pinch before it becomes a crunch."  Tactical:  Notice when you are becoming 'activated' or irritated by small behaviors.Substitute 'it' for 'I/You/We' to determine if a conversation is worth having (e.g., 'We are worth it').    "What did you hear me say? One of the most powerful things you can do when somebody responds in a way that feels very unexpected and out of whack with what you just said is go back to, 'What did you hear me say?'"  Tactical:  Ask 'What did you hear me say?' to uncover misinterpretations.Validate the other person's reaction based on what they heard, even if it wasn't what you intended.

"Say the thing you think you cannot say... I think that I've come to believe that often your biggest strength, one, is also your weakness, but two, is something that you don't know is a big strength because it's almost like breathing."  Tactical:  Identify the 'left-hand column' of internal thoughts you are filtering outVoice uncomfortable observations to open up doors for others to speak    "One is, ask a question. Right? A question is not threatening... The next trick is you own it. This is your observation, this is your perception. This is not a judgment. I am not saying, 'Lenny, I think you really botched that interview.' That's not useful. If I said, 'Lenny, you know what? I wonder if you missed an opportunity in that interview.'"  Tactical:  Ask a question to open a difficult topic without being threateningOwn the observation by framing it as 'my experience' or 'I noticed' rather than an objective truthDetoxify your internal commentary before speaking it out loud

"Where if I'm asking myself the question, 'If this person on my team came to me and said, "I'm leaving today. I have a different opportunity and I would like to take it," would I do everything I could to keep them at Netflix?' If not, then I should be having that tough conversation about, 'Should you really be here? Are you in the right role?'"  Tactical:  Regularly ask yourself if you would fight to keep each team member if they resignedInitiate difficult conversations immediately if the answer to the Keepers Test is 'no'    "When something's not meeting expectations or really showing up as excellence, I think it's a combination of both giving the feedback on that and being direct about it and being specific about what would it take to get this to the bar that I am expecting... And then the third and probably most important thing is help them fill that gap."  Tactical:  Be specific about what is required to reach the 'excellence' barJump in to help the employee iterate on work (like a document) to show them what the bar looks like

"I struggled for years with feedback to generate the intended outcome... As soon as I started closing the gap and realized I need to try harder to think about the story arc of this feedback, that becomes clearest to me how to do it when I have the intended outcome in mind."  Tactical:  Design the 'story arc' of feedback to ensure the recipient remains in a receptive state.Ask 'Why do you believe that?' to drill below a behavior into the underlying belief during a tough conversation.

"Since I'm coach executives, let's do an executive example, so conflict avoidant executive. I don't want to feel the out of control in this that I do when people argue. I don't want to feel that level of out of control, so I am going to be conflict avoidant. I'm going to avoid conflict. Every way that we go to avoid a feeling, becomes the way that, that feeling gets invited towards us."  Tactical:  Identify the specific emotion you are trying to avoid (e.g., feeling out of control or ashamed) during a conflict.Practice 'falling in love' with that uncomfortable feeling to remove the resistance that makes the conversation difficult.

"if you manage to get them to take the risk to give you the feedback, your answer has to be enthusiastically grateful. That's the key... externally, I'm like, 'Hey, thank you,' and I mean it. I think that's the key that most people don't focus on."  Tactical:  Ask for feedback on specific traits (e.g., 'executive presence') rather than general performance.Offer self-critique first to make it safe for others to provide honest agreement or disagreement.Respond to all feedback with enthusiastic gratitude to encourage future honesty.

"Feedback really, in my mind, ideally, should be a daily practice... what is the best tool for us to get better? It is feedback."  Tactical:  Treat feedback as a daily practice to accelerate team improvement.    "The first tip on getting feedback or delivering hard feedback is first go and actually establish that our relationship is one in which we value each other's contribution... Start by saying, 'Hey, really excited to work with you. I feel like our best collaboration is I want you to help me get better.'"  Tactical:  Establish a 'feedback-first' relationship early on.Ask colleagues if they prefer feedback in the moment or at set intervals.    "If I sit down with you and I say, 'Lenny, I'm so nervous right now. I want to give you some feedback and I'm really worried that it's going to impact our relationship... but I also feel like it's just going to help you to hear it if you can.' That does so much of the work of... It's humanizing."  Tactical:  Check your intention: ensure you are giving feedback to help, not to be 'right'.Verbally acknowledge the difficulty of the conversation to build human connection.    "Sometimes a win-win thing is to just say, 'Look, it's not working, and I respect and value you so much that I know you want to do something that you can be proud of and you can grow in... and right here, what we got, this isn't it.'"  Tactical:  Frame termination as a necessary step for the individual to find a role where they can truly thrive.

"I work with a lot of founders who are not the sort of classic control freaks. They're super nice and their teams love them and they love their teams. So for them, it can be really hard to deliver hard feedback, to deliver negative feedback and even more to actually create consequences."  Tactical:  Recognize that creating consequences is a form of respect for the other person's choicesMove beyond just giving feedback to clearly stating the desired outcome or change    "I love radical candor, for example, where I try to go a step further than radical candor is to not just say, 'Hey, here's my feedback. Just wanted you to know.' But to say, 'And I want something. I would like to see an outcome.'"  Tactical:  Frame the complaint as an implied dream or vision for a better worldEnsure the feedback includes a clear ask for what you want to happen next    "And it's basically when you want to give someone feedback, the template is when you do a behavior, I feel a feeling, and she's big on like say actual feeling word not like, 'I feel like, or I feel that,' blah, blah, blah. And step three is, 'I'm telling you this because...' and then what you want them to change."  Tactical:  Use the 'Behavior-Feeling-Purpose' frameworkAvoid 'I feel like' (which introduces stories) and use actual feeling wordsStay factual by describing what a video camera would have recorded

"Radical Candor is just what happens when you care personally and challenge directly at the same time. And I think it's probably best understood by what it's not because we all fail on one of those two dimensions or both of them multiple times a day. So you can think about it as a two by two framework. On the vertical axis is care personally, the horizontal axis is challenge directly. What happens when we remember to challenge directly, but we forget to show that we care personally. That is what I call obnoxious aggression"  Tactical:  Avoid 'obnoxious aggression' by ensuring you show you care before challenging.Avoid 'ruinous empathy' by not withholding necessary feedback to spare feelings.Avoid 'manipulative insincerity' which is neither caring nor challenging.    "I can tell when you do that thing with your hand, then I'm going to have to be a lot more direct with you. When you say um every third word, it makes you sound stupid."  Tactical:  If a person brushes off gentle feedback, increase the directness of the challenge until it is heard.Use specific, high-impact language if necessary to ensure the recipient understands the gravity of the issue.    "You want to be humble, you want to be helpful, you want to do it immediately. You want to do it in person or at least synchronously. If you can't do it in person. You also want to praise in public and criticize in private, and you don't want to give people either praise or criticism about their personality. So if you want to remember all that, it's HHIIPPP, two H's, two I's, kind of three P's depending on how you count."  Tactical:  Deliver feedback immediately rather than saving it for a later meeting.Ensure feedback is about work/behavior, not the person's inherent personality.Prioritize synchronous communication (phone or in-person) to gauge the recipient's emotional reaction.    "you want to use sort of context, observation, result, next step. So context, in the meeting, observation, when you said um every third word, it makes you sound stupid. Next step, go to the speech coach. Also is important for praise, in the meeting context, when you offered both sides of the argument, observation, result is it earned you credibility. Next step is do more of that. So you can call it CORE"  Tactical:  State the Context of the behavior.Share the specific Observation of what happened.Explain the Result or impact of that behavior.Define the Next Step or expected change.    "if I didn't fire Bob, I was going to lose all my best performers because not only had it been unfair to Bob not to tell him, I also had been unfair to everyone on the team. And they were frustrated. Their deliverables were late because his deliverables were late. They weren't able to do their best work because they were having to spend so much time redoing his work."  Tactical:  Address poor performance early to prevent a toxic environment for high performers.Realize that withholding criticism is ultimately unkind as it leads to avoidable terminations.    "if you find your employee looks sad or mad, if they look sad, pause and say, 'I feel like maybe I didn't say that in the best possible way. How could I have said it differently?' And so that means you're going up on the care personally, dimension, but you're not going the wrong way on challenge directly."  Tactical:  Gauge the listener's reaction and adjust your approach in real-time.If the recipient is upset, acknowledge their feelings but stay firm on the necessary challenge.

"One of those things that we did two years ago was we had to architect a layoff, and we had never done a scaled layoff before. We had to lay off 10% of the company to save the company... It's a complete dumpster fire. It's a nightmare. I'm getting bashed in the press, on Twitter. Everyone is shooting at me."  Tactical:  Accept that difficult decisions like layoffs will never 'go well' regardless of communicationDevelop a 'thick skin' to handle inevitable public and internal backlashFocus on the 'regeneration' of the company post-crisis

"There's a more robust structure I talk about in the book called The 4 Is... The first I is information. You're just setting the playing field so the person knows what you're giving the feedback about. The second is impact, and this is impact on you, the feedback giver. The third is the invitation that you make, and then the final is the implications or consequences."  Tactical:  Start with objective information/facts about the behaviorState the impact the behavior has on you or the teamInvite the other person into the conversation to find a solutionOutline the implications or benefits of changing the behavior    "An apology to me, I have a AAA... It's three steps, acknowledge, appreciate, and amends. So I have to acknowledge what I did. ... Then I appreciate. 'I can imagine my doing that made you feel bad...' The amends part is, 'I will work not to do this. In fact, I will wait till you're done...'"  Tactical:  Acknowledge the specific behavior or mistake madeAppreciate the impact or negative feelings caused to the other personMake specific amends by stating exactly how you will change your behavior in the future

"Fundamentally, the most selfish thing you can do is withhold feedback from someone. When you think a thought that would help someone improve and you avoid giving it to them because it would make you uncomfortable. Well, you're optimizing for your own comfort, and it's fundamentally selfish."  Tactical:  Give feedback immediately when you observe something that could help someone improve.Reframe difficult feedback as an unselfish act of service to the recipient.

Matt Mochary 6 quotes

"The biggest marker that I've seen between a botched layoff and a successful layoff is at the moment someone hears that they no longer have a job, did they hear it from their manager in a one-on-one? If that's when they heard it, it'll be okay. But if they heard it in an email, in a group chat, in any kind of thing where they were sitting next to or they're hearing it along with other people, it wasn't personalized, it wasn't one-on-one, that is terrible."  Tactical:  Always deliver termination news in a 1:1 meeting, never via email or group announcement.Ensure the setting allows the person to express their emotions privately.    "I believe that fear is actually giving you bad advice and I think you're predicting that if you do this A will happen. Well, I'm predicting that if you do that, the exact opposite will happen."  Tactical:  Check with a neutral third party when you feel 'gripped' by fear to get a clearer view of reality.Test your fear-based predictions against a non-fearful person's predictions to see which outcome actually occurs.    "I at times feel anger and I act on that anger and I don't even realize I'm in anger... she said, 'I perceive you to be in anger.' So it's an I statement and it's simply what she's perceiving. There's no judgment. That was able to punch through my anger and then I woke up and went, oh, and then I stopped and just didn't act until I was able to shift out of anger."  Tactical:  Use the phrase 'I perceive you to be in [emotion]' to provide feedback without triggering defensiveness.Stop and refuse to act or speak until you have shifted out of an angry state.    "The reason people are bad at this is because they think that they're hurting the person who they're letting go... Decision is one thing, implementation is completely and utterly separate. That's the same thing here in letting someone go. But if you let them go kindly and humanely, the key is, in my opinion, you become their agent, like Michael Ovitz, the CAA agent. You help them find their next job actively."  Tactical:  Separate the decision (what the customer/business needs) from the implementation (how to help the person being hurt).Actively serve as the departing employee's 'agent' by reaching out to your network to find them a role that fits their passions.    "I start it off, 'Hey, this is going to be a difficult conversation. I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself. You are not going to enjoy this.' What I found is that the way the amygdala gets triggered is often because of surprise. So, if you give someone just a few seconds to mentally prepare, then the amygdala often doesn't get triggered nearly as hard."  Tactical:  Start difficult conversations by explicitly stating it will be difficult and giving the person a few seconds to prepare.After delivering the news, ask the person to share their feelings to help them release the emotional charge.    "You actually want to cut deep because cutting two times or three times creates PTSD in an organization. It's trauma one, trauma two, trauma three. Now they're like, ah, it's just going to keep happening."  Tactical:  Calculate the necessary savings in dollars rather than headcount to avoid losing the most productive junior staff.Complete all individual notification meetings in a single morning to minimize the period of uncertainty.

"I actually pulled them aside and I said, 'Hey, we need to move a lot faster. This is where we need to get to by X. We're a growth team. We need to prove wins out early.'... I think in that conversation what's important is also saying, 'I believe you can do all these things and I'm doing this to support you.'"  Tactical:  Address performance or speed issues within the first few weeks of observationState clearly that the feedback is intended to set them up for successKeep feedback focused on specific observations and impacts rather than personal criticism

"If you have feedback to give someone else, I think you can start by asking, 'Hey, do you have feedback from me?' And kind of taking the feedback first so then that person feels like, 'Okay, maybe I have my way of seeing this situation. Let me communicate that and get off my chest.'"  Tactical:  Be explicit about your level of confidence in an opinion (e.g., 'medium confidence') to allow others to push backEstablish a culture of directness early in a working relationship by stating your communication style upfrontAct on received feedback immediately to demonstrate that feedback is valued

"I'd never fired anyone before I joined Intercom... and realized it always works out for both sides. And the nicest thing to do is to do the harder thing. It's actually the nicer thing to do. People are relieved in this example."  Tactical:  Reframe difficult conversations as the 'nicer' thing to do for the individual's long-term success.

"Actually, the goal of any conflict is to create mutual understanding."  Tactical:  Shift focus from convincing to understanding the other person's perspective.    "I'm going to give you a framework that I like that many of my clients use. It's from Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication. It is a book and a framework. So it's four steps. The first step is observations... The next step is feelings... The third step is needs... And lastly, the step is to make a request."  Tactical:  State objective observations (facts that can't be argued).Express feelings as body-based emotions (e.g., 'I feel anxious') rather than thoughts (avoid 'I feel like...').Identify the underlying human need (e.g., clarity, connection).Make a specific, achievable request.    "There is always something that we're doing to contribute to the conflict, even if it feels like the other person is insane... Entering any conflict conversation with humility, and curiosity about the other person's experience, is critical."  Tactical:  Ask: 'How am I complicit in creating the conditions that I claim I don't want?'Enter conversations with humility and curiosity instead of rigidity.

Uri Levine 1 quote

"The problem was not that the team was not right. The problem was that the CEO did not make hard decision. Making hard decisions is hard... In a small place like a startup, the hard decisions will always go to the top. Now, if the CEO does not make that hard decisions, the result is always the same. The top performing people would leave."  Tactical:  Fire underperformers immediately to protect the culture and retain top talent.Recognize that everyone in a small team usually knows who shouldn't be there within the first month.

"I have a framework called strategy, not self-expression... the goal is behavior change. So if that's the goal, trim everything else that you were about to say that does not actually contribute to that goal and only keep the part that will make the person want to change."  Tactical:  Vent frustrations to a third party (therapist, partner) before the actual feedback conversationTrim 90% of the emotional 'fluff' and focus only on what motivates the change

"When you are extending yourself, you're not nice. It's not always nice or like, it sometimes is having hard conversations. It's knowing that, oh, there's a human, they know I care about them. So when the feedback is coming like raw, they know that it's in their best interest because I've shown enough times that I genuinely care about the person behind the role."  Tactical:  Show genuine care for the person behind the role before delivering raw feedbackPrioritize the other person's growth over being liked

"What we put into place is something we call Fight Club. I'll probably get in trouble for talking about Fight Club. The first rule is you don't talk about Fight Club. But it's 30 minutes every week, and it's just for myself, my engineering, and my design leader; and we get together, and we know that we're going there to have a conflict."  Tactical:  Create a dedicated 30-minute weekly slot for leadership conflict resolutionEnter the meeting with the explicit mindset that disagreements will occurAddress tensions early to prevent them from escalating into larger organizational issues

"Convey this feedback as situation, behavior, impact. The situation is on Tuesday in that meeting at 3:00. Behavior, you interrupted me while I was saying this thing.

Tactical:  Specify the exact time and place of the behavior (Situation).Describe the observable action without judgment (Behavior).Share how that behavior affected you or the team (Impact).

"I had to let go of people over Zoom. I couldn't even meet them in-person. I still remember when I actually finished my speech and I told them, 'This is the last day,' now, I literally shed a tear in front of everybody, because I was like, 'Man, this is hard. This is really, really hard.'"  Tactical:  Lead with vulnerability and human emotion during difficult organizational changesAcknowledge the external factors to ensure employees understand it is not a reflection of their performance

Tobi Lutke 1 quote

"Spending time and longer time in careers with people and then holding them to a high standard means that they accomplish very often things that just they didn't imagine they could. To me this is the most wonderful thing to see... hearing from someone that you respect that 'Hey, I think you had it in you to do this thing significantly better because I think you probably saw fairly early in the project this sort of path A path B. You chose path B potentially out of convenience even though you knew that wasn't the right thing. And I actually expected better of you'... that's hard to hear, right, because it's right. But it's also extremely valuable, right?"  Tactical:  Hold people accountable to their potential rather than their current levelCall out when someone chooses a path of convenience over their own convictionFrame difficult feedback as an expectation of greatness based on respect

When you go back and you work with your team, always have the lens are you improving things."  Tactical:  In leadership meetings, prioritize holding peers accountable for business outcomes over just reporting status.Ask 'Have I improved things today compared to yesterday?' as the primary yardstick for team performance.    "Every offsite that I do with my leadership team, usually there is a one to two hour session where it is feedback to Varun, and I actually do it openly... I want to show my vulnerabilities to everyone, that I am not perfect."  Tactical:  Dedicate specific time in offsites for 'open feedback' where the team critiques the leader's performance.Model vulnerability by acknowledging blind spots publicly to encourage a culture of honest feedback.
