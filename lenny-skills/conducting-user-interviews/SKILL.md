Conducting User Interviews  User interviews are the primary tool for understanding 'why' users behave the way they do. The goal is not to validate your ideas but to falsify them by discovering what's truly blocking adoption. Watch users in their natural environment, listen more than you talk, and filter for people who have actually taken action.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 43 experts.

1 Interview people who have taken action, not hypothetical buyers  Only interview people who have already spent time or money trying to solve the problem you're addressing. Ignore 'bitching' (complaining) and look for 'switching' (actual behavior change). People who haven't tried to make progress won't give you useful signal.

Featured guest perspectives

"I only talk to people who have already tried to make the progress... I need to talk to people who did something and tried and though they might've failed, what made them try?"

— Bob Moesta    "The problem is, which anyone who hasn't done sales before that joined YC, they realize this, is that if you take the average customer group in the world, 90% are not early adopters... You have to reach 10 to find one."

— Gustaf Alstromer        2 Watch users, don't just ask them  Observational research reveals problems that are invisible in data funnels. Watch users perform their current workflows via screen share. Look for 'invisible' pain points like repetitive Excel tasks that users have normalized. Data tells you where to look; observation tells you why.

Featured guest perspectives

"Don't use the data alone to figure out who the marginal user is. It'll give you a clue where they are and what might be wrong, will give you some hints. It's not going to give you the answer. You have to go watch them to find the answer."

— Adriel Frederick    "The best way for you to figure out what is the intensity of the problem is not to ask them but to watch them... have them screen share, have them walk you through their daily workflow about the area where you're doing some discovery."

— Gustaf Alstromer        3 Avoid pitching; focus on listening  Never start a research call with a company intro or demo. Use silence to let the customer open up about their top-of-mind issues. Ask open-ended prompts: 'What would you be working on if you weren't talking to me?' or 'Show me your inbox.' A wasted opportunity is pitching when you could be learning.

Featured guest perspectives

"You have to carefully listen and not pitch your customer... people don't want to be pitched. I'm sometimes on a UXR call... and the first thing that they start talking about when we get on the call is, 'Hi, I'm the CEO of X, Y, and Z company. We do one, two, and three. I want to show you a demo.' It's like, 'Hold up, I'm a customer...'"

— Jeff Weinstein    "Just like going to a doctor, you don't want the doctor to come and say, 'Hey, can I show you a movie of the operation I just did?'... What I would like to do is talk to you about this pain I have in my side."

— Geoffrey Moore        4 Seek falsification, not validation  Approach research looking to be proven wrong, not to confirm existing beliefs. A researcher asking 'what do customers want?' is a bad researcher. Focus on understanding behaviors and problems, not on having users design the solution. Avoid 'check-the-box' research at the end of a cycle.

Featured guest perspectives

"One of my big mantras was, 'We don't validate, we falsify. We are looking to be wrong.' Many PMs, many designers are not in that place. They do not want to be wrong. They're looking to validate, and that's user-centered performance."

— Judd Antin        5 Make customer conversations a calendar habit  A founder's commitment to user research should be reflected in their calendar, ideally occupying 20-30% of their time. Automate the sourcing of interviews using tools like Zapier, Gong, and userinterviews.com to keep a constant pulse on the customer without manual overhead.

Featured guest perspectives

"I think it's look at your calendar and there should be 20 or 30% of your time that the calendar says something like customer meeting, customer call... when the calendar is not that... I don't think that's talking to customers."

— Dalton Caldwell    "I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe... those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't."

— Marty Cagan

✗ Common Mistakes

Asking users what features they want rather than understanding their problemsInterviewing friends or non-target users and counting their feedbackUsing a rigid discussion guide that prevents following valuable threadsDelegating customer research and losing critical nuances     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

You consistently discover surprising insights that data alone couldn't revealYour calendar reflects 20-30% time spent on direct customer interactionUsers open up about their real frustrations rather than giving polite answersResearch results regularly challenge your existing assumptions

"Don't use the data alone to figure out who the marginal user is. It'll give you a clue where they are and what might be wrong, will give you some hints. It's not going to give you the answer. You have to go watch them to find the answer."  Tactical:  Watch users use the product in person to identify where their mental models (e.g., using nicknames vs. legal names) conflict with product design.Use data to identify *where* to look, but use interviews and observation to find the *why*.

"We were literally on the ground in India every three months took a team of engineers with me. I'm talking like we're in Delhi in people's homes and Mumbai, and we went to go investigate what was going on, watch people make friends, watch them use people you may know."  Tactical:  Watch users perform core tasks to see where their mental model (e.g., searching by photos) differs from the product's design (e.g., searching by name).Identify non-Western paradigms in user behavior to localize product features effectively.

Bob Moesta 3 quotes

"The first thing we do is we try to extract the story from the customer. And it doesn't have to be my product, it could be somebody else's product if I haven't built it yet. It's like, what are people going to fire when they hire me?"  Tactical:  Interview people who have recently purchased or switched products to understand the 'causation' of their move.Ask about what the user will 'fire' in order to 'hire' your new product.    "I only talk to people who have already tried to make the progress... I need to talk to people who did something and tried and though they might've failed, what made them try?"  Tactical:  Filter for interviewees who have already spent time or money trying to solve the problem.Ignore 'bitching' (complaining) and look for 'switching' (actual behavior change).    "The other tip I have is to not have a discussion guide. It drives people crazy because everybody wants to ask the same set of questions, but the problem happens is when you ask the same set of questions, you actually don't follow the ones that actually have the most meaningful information in it"  Tactical:  Use the 'Four Forces' (push, pull, anxiety, habit) as a mental framework instead of a script.Use 'bracketing' (offering two extremes) to help users articulate feelings they can't quite name.

"Speaking as a former PM, I would not ever give up spending time with customers and watching their pain. That's how I fell in love with product was I saw my internal customer 12 years back now fighting with the keyboard, fighting with the mouse, and I was just like, 'Oh, my gosh. What's this guy doing?'"  Tactical:  Watch customers use the product in their natural environment to see where they fight with the interfacePrioritize direct observation over second-hand reports to understand the 'pain' acutely    "I cannot see product managers saying, 'I don't want to be a part of that conversation.' Then you know what? I'm going to say it then don't be in product."  Tactical:  Ensure PMs maintain a direct line to customers even when support or ops teams existUse customer conversations as the primary tool for problem discovery

"I would start pretending that the product existed in the interviews. Only to find out, at the end, people was like, 'Oh, it's not out yet.' And they're like, 'What I want to use...' You could really feel the like, 'No, no, no, no, this has to be out. I want to start using it.'"  Tactical:  Use clickable, full prototypes to simulate a real experienceObserve emotional reactions when users realize they cannot yet access the product

"I just said, 'Listen, let's get some older people who are hosts in here to see how well they will be versed in managing their listing purely on mobile.'"  Tactical:  Proactively recruit users from underrepresented age groups to test major strategic shifts    "I actually went into the homes of these hosts all around the world... I think I was lucky because Brian did less of that than he did with other people."  Tactical:  Conduct 'world tours' or home visits to gain deep qualitative empathy for the user

Christopher Miller 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"we spent a lot of time talking to users directly, and a lot of guerrilla user research techniques. Literally, sometimes going outside and just talking to runners in passing to understand what were the challenges in finding motivation"  Tactical:  Use 'guerrilla' research methods to talk to users in their natural environmentFocus interviews on understanding the emotional and motivational drivers of behavior    "I usually tend to really enjoy my conversations with people who decided not to use HubSpot and to really try to unpack what drove that decision. Was it as calculated, as I think sometimes we can all maybe assume... And then you often learn that they're sometimes kind of emotional, really instinctual and visceral"  Tactical:  Prioritize interviews with people who chose a competitor or 'non-consumption'Ask questions that probe the emotional state of the user during their decision-making process

David Placek 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We do consumer research or customer research at that stage... putting the names in a series of drills... seeing how these names fire their imagination. And that's the most important thing in research, not is the name popular, are they comfortable with it, does it fit to concept."  Tactical:  Ask users what they expect from a product with a certain name rather than if they 'like' the nameTest if a name creates a 'predisposition to consider' the product

Dalton Caldwell 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"You have to get out in the world and talk to people in person. And you can't just hide behind your keyboard and call that talking to customers. Right? I think a lot of folks, the inclinations are to build a landing page and buy some Instagram ads and try to get people to sign up for something. And again, maybe that's something, but I think a lot of the reason people do that is they're just shy and they don't want to put themselves out there because it's a little awkward to go talk to people."  Tactical:  Prioritize in-person physical meetings over digital proxies like landing pages or adsPower through the social awkwardness of talking to strangers about your ideaAvoid using 'customer validation' as a euphemism for just running ads    "I think it's look at your calendar and there should be 20 or 30% of your time that the calendar says something like customer meeting, customer call, meeting with who, meeting with this person. And when the calendar is not that or it's all... Again, what you're actually doing is just buying ads to try to validate your idea, I don't think that's talking to customers."  Tactical:  Audit your calendar to ensure 20-30% of time is spent on direct customer calls or meetingsDifferentiate between 'staring at analytics' and having actual conversations

Dmitry Zlokazov 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"When you delegate such an important thing as customer research and collecting their feedback to someone, you will get a refined filtered version. You won't get these nuances of how people describe things, which emotions they feel like and so on, and where they think stuck. It's very easy to lose all those important bytes of information in this process. So I'm a strong believer that it's very important to have direct communication channel to customers."  Tactical:  Avoid delegating customer research to maintain a direct connection to user emotions and pain pointsBuild internal tools that allow product owners to launch surveys or interviews in a few clicks

Geoffrey Moore 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Just like going to a doctor, you don't want the doctor to come and say, 'Hey, can I show you a movie of the operation I just did?'... What I would like to do is talk to you about this pain I have in my side. And then when the doctor asks you good questions about it, you go, 'Ah, this is a good doctor. I'm going to trust this.'"  Tactical:  Focus the interview entirely on the user's 'pain' before mentioning your solution.Build trust by asking deep, industry-specific questions that show you understand their context.

Gustaf Alstromer 3 quotes

Listen to episode →

"The problem is, which anyone who hasn't done sales before that joined YC, they realize this, is that if you take the average customer group in the world, 90% are not early adopters... Those 10 percents are the early adopters. They're The ones that you actually want to reach. But that means you have to reach 10 to find one."  Tactical:  Expect a 90% rejection or indifference rate when seeking discovery interviewsTarget the 10% of users who are willing to take risks on new solutions    "I think people just have this fear that, 'If I get a lot of rejection, that means everything is bad.' But the rejection should be put in context to the early adopter idea and that most people who don't care are not early adopters... you just need to overcome that fear and just learn that there's nothing that's really that bad that can happen when people don't use the service."  Tactical:  Internalize that users are busy and their lack of response is usually indifference, not a permanent rejection of the idea    "The best way for you to figure out what is the intensity of the problem is not to ask them but to watch them or to watch them solve the thing that they do... have them screen share, have them walk you through their daily workflow about the area where you're doing some discovery. That is the best thing."  Tactical:  Use screen sharing to watch users perform their current manual workflowsLook for 'invisible' pain points like repetitive Excel tasks that users have normalized

Jackson Shuttleworth 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We did some UXR in India many years ago... the idea of keeping a flame lit to show your commitment to something makes less sense... it was a metaphor for a mechanic, and when we redesigned it... we actually focused the design on the screen to show your number going up."  Tactical:  Test product metaphors (like the 'flame') in different cultural contexts to ensure they are universally understood.

Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"These conversations with customers are so much more fruitful and pointed when you've got the context of I know exactly what my hypothesis is and you have prototypes to show them."  Tactical:  Always bring a prototype to a customer interview to ground the feedback in reality.Use a scorecard to track if the customer fits the profile, has the problem, and reacts positively to the differentiation.

Jeff Weinstein 4 quotes

Listen to episode →

"The moment the customer felt compelled enough to go out of their way to talk about some problem, that's a unbelievable gift. I will leave a meeting to just get one message back to them. If you're text message friendly with five or 10 of those, you are going to have so much direct signal that is infectious."  Tactical:  Respond to customer feedback with extreme speed to build a 'secret portal' of trust.Aim to be 'text message friendly' with 5-10 ambitious, technical customers.    "You have to carefully listen and not pitch your customer... people don't want to be pitched. I'm sometimes on a UXR call... and the first thing that they start talking about when we get on the call is, 'Hi, I'm the CEO of X, Y, and Z company. We do one, two, and three. I want to show you a demo.' It's like, 'Hold up, I'm a customer. I have...' What a wasted opportunity you've just done here."  Tactical:  Avoid starting calls with a company intro or demo.Use silence to allow the customer to open up about their top-of-mind issues.    "I'll prompt our customers, I'll say, 'Hey, do you mind just opening up your email? What's in there?' Or, 'If you weren't talking to me right now, what would you be working on?' Or, 'Hey, last week, what grinds your gears? What are you not looking forward to?' Or magic wand, 'What do you wish you could just have off your plate immediately?'"  Tactical:  Ask customers what they would be doing if they weren't on the call with you.Ask customers to show you their inbox to see real-world friction points.    "I will have them practice charging me. I'll just say, 'Hey, I'm just a friend. I'm trying to help you out... send me an invoice or a payment link for $1 right now, right now. That way, when it comes time to actually charge your first customer, it won't be your first time.'"  Tactical:  Ask potential customers to send you a $1 invoice during the interview to test the payment flow and their commitment.

"I would be very open and honest with where you are. Hey, I'm an early stage startup. We have a lot to learn. Can we kind of gain your insight into how this problem is manifesting on your side?"  Tactical:  Ask prospects to 'walk through what's living in your head' to understand their visualization of the solution.Avoid generic questions like 'what keeps you up at night' in favor of specific questions about problem manifestation.

"The team, data scientists included, just sat and made phone calls. ... that's where qualitative research is superior to quantitative research, it's asking for the context, to actually talking to people to figure out what was the motivation, what worked, what didn't for them."  Tactical:  Have data scientists conduct phone interviews with customers to understand the motivation behind the numbers.Use qualitative insights from these calls to inform the next iteration of product testing.

"One of my big mantras was, 'We don't validate, we falsify. We are looking to be wrong.' Many PMs, many designers are not in that place. They do not want to be wrong. They're looking to validate, and that's user-centered performance."  Tactical:  Adopt a 'falsify, don't validate' mindset during discovery.Avoid 'check-the-box' research at the end of a product cycle that is only intended to signal customer obsession.    "A researcher who's going to ask customers what they want is a bad researcher. You need a different researcher. I've never done that in my career. No one on my team has ever run a study that's like that."  Tactical:  Do not ask users directly what features they want built.Focus interviews on understanding the user's context and pain points.

Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter 1 quote      "We showed those to people across the political spectrum. We saw, hey, people really like these. Whether they're on the right or left, they seem very open to reading these community notes even when they're critical to people of their own side."  Tactical:  Recruit research participants from opposing ideological or user groups to test for neutralityUse unmoderated studies (like usertesting.com) to gather early feedback on controversial concepts

Kevin Aluwi 1 quote

"I think I just wanted to understand what that role was like to build a lot more empathy towards the job and make sure that our product was catered towards what those needs were... this is eventually what led to, I think a lot of the support I gave to our driver teams when they were pushing for, Hey, we need more waiting fees, we need to add multiple stops in order to make sure that hey, a lot of this extra work was actually compensated."  Tactical:  Personally perform the service or use the product in real-world conditions to build empathyUse first-hand experience to identify 'hidden' pain points that require product solutions, such as uncompensated labor

Kevin Yien 1 quote

"PMs need direct exposure to raw material. End of story. And so that's where I think you just need to constantly be talking to or interacting with whoever is your customer... you can set up workflows either via Zapier or something else to say, 'Who was the customer? Pull their email, put that into a sequence, drop in my Calendly' and you just have interviews showing up automatically on your calendar."  Tactical:  Use tools like Gong to alert you when specific keywords are mentioned in sales calls.Automate outreach to those customers via Zapier and customer.io to book research sessions.Use userinterviews.com for targeted B2B participant sourcing.

Madhavan Ramanujam 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"If you go and ask someone, 'How much should I charge for this product?' You're actually going to get garbage back... People are absolutely meaningless, relatively super smart."  Tactical:  Use relative indexing: Ask how much value your product provides compared to a known anchor (e.g., Salesforce)Ask for three price points: Acceptable, Expensive, and Prohibitively ExpensiveAlways ask 'Why' after a price response to understand the underlying value perception

Marty Cagan 3 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I tell this to user researchers at the companies that I coach, if the product manager and the designer are not available to be there during their products test, cancel the test. They need to be there. This is what makes them useful to their team."  Tactical:  Ensure the PM and Designer are present for every user testAvoid relying on research reports delivered in isolation by researchers    "The first is they have to really get to know the users and customers. They have to be considered pretty much one of the experts on the users and customers. I remember when I was an engineer wanting to become a product manager, the person coaching me said explicitly that I was not allowed to make any decisions for the team until after I visited 30 customers."  Tactical:  Aim to visit or interview a significant number of customers (e.g., 30) before making major product decisionsDevelop expertise on the user that exceeds other members of the team    "I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't."  Tactical:  Aim for a high volume of customer visits (e.g., 30) before feeling confident in a PM role.Ensure a mix of geographic locations to get a diverse perspective on customer needs.

"It's also about finding participants who want to opt into research. So making sure that you have customers aware that, 'Hey, we might contact you to do customer interviews. This is why. Do you want to participate in alphas and betas? If so, this is what it entails.'"  Tactical:  Build a participant database of customers who have opted into researchClearly define the expectations and cadence for customers participating in alphas or betas

"Once a month, ideally, you should just have some sort of a schedule for yourself where if you're at a larger company and you have a user researcher who can recruit people for you, that's great, but if not, just go find people who either fit the demographic for your user or even are your user and have them sign up for an account and walking through it."  Tactical:  Schedule at least one session a month to watch a real person sign up and use the product.Focus on the user's tone of voice and facial expressions during the process.

Mihika Kapoor 1 quote

"Something that I find incredibly useful is to not just ask users of your product what they think about your product, but to ask non-users about your product, why they're not using your product. And actually I think that those are the most insightful conversations."  Tactical:  Join sales calls to hear customer pain points firsthand and cross-pollinate them into the roadmapAsk non-users why they haven't adopted the product to identify marketing or perception gapsCreate Loom videos of internal product usage to inspire and evangelize new use cases to customers

Nabeel S. Qureshi 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"You would spend maybe Monday to Thursday and you would actually go into the building where the customer worked and you would work alongside them. You would literally get a desk there... you learn to live and breathe the customer's problems and you learn to speak their language."  Tactical:  Sit physically next to users to observe their workflows in real-time.Learn the specific industry jargon and 'memes' to build trust and understanding.    "Monday, you go in. You do your meetings. Monday night, you build something. Tuesday, you show it to somebody. Tuesday, you get the feedback. Tuesday night, you iterate on it. Wednesday, you show it to somebody. Wednesday night, you iterate on it. So, you get four of these, five of these cycles every single week."  Tactical:  Show work-in-progress daily to get immediate course correction.Iterate overnight on feedback received during the day to maintain momentum.

Nan Yu 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"My goal is to feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad. They come to us with a request, 'Hey, we want X,' and it's like there's something motivating it... What is the actual emotional valence that is motivating whatever you're telling me?"  Tactical:  Ask questions from unexpected angles to uncover the root motivation.Look for the 'emotional hooks'—the specific moments where a user feels frustrated or unsuccessful.    "You can ask people directly like, 'How do you feel?' And they're not necessarily going to tell you, but if you have a long enough and deep enough conversation with them, you start to level with them, and you're starting to see stuff from their perspective."  Tactical:  Spend enough time with a user to get them to open up about specific 'bad moments' (e.g., a missed deadline).Use the user's specific story to inform the mental model of the problem.

"Imagine building a startup, like a product from day one and not being able to sit right next to your customer and being like, 'Show me how you do this or show me how you do that.' It's incredibly hard. You're looking for such faint signal. The idea that you would try to get it through layers of indirection and games of telephone is crazy."  Tactical:  Remove legal or organizational barriers that prevent PMs from talking directly to usersObserve users in their natural environment rather than relying on third-party reports

Paul Adams 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"What I used to do with people was map out their social network, all the people in it, their family, their friends, how they communicate. We'd map on all the channels, we'd talk about what worked well, what didn't. And, we did this with dozens and dozens of people over the course of maybe 18 months. And the same pattern emerged every single time."  Tactical:  Use visual mapping (e.g., social networks or workflows) during interviews to identify recurring patterns.

Ravi Mehta 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We identified something quantitatively that was really interesting... Our assumptions about why that use case was that use case were wrong. And when we ended up talking to users, we had some really surprising and fun conversations as a result, and we were also able to recalibrate and understand what those people were solving for."  Tactical:  Identify 'power users' or 'whales' in your data and conduct targeted usability studies with them.Ask users what they are 'framing' the cost of your product against to understand their mental model of value.

Shaun Clowes 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Once you interview between 7 and 14 people, you stop learning new things. Less than 7, you don't learn enough, more than 14, you start learning anything new. And so if you interviewed two people, you probably don't have enough data. If you interviewed 22, you probably had too much, so they don't even right size their efforts."  Tactical:  Aim for 7 to 14 interviews per research goal to reach thematic saturation.    "Then they go into these conversations asking leading questions, which really are designed to get the customer to say what they already want to be true, which is so they haven't done enough research or they've done too much and then they've blown up all of the results before they've even heard anything."  Tactical:  Avoid leading questions that prompt the customer to agree with your existing hypotheses.

"Lighthouse Users Program... we work with 10 and we prove that the problems that they had are the things that we solved... put these people in front of the whole team, not just the PMs, PM, designer, engineering. We meet on Zoom, we chat, we work with the same ones over months to build a product. They are with us on Slack."  Tactical:  Recruit 10 specific users to co-create the product over several monthsInvolve engineers directly in user calls to build 'product engineers' who empathize with specific customersSet up shared Slack channels with early users for a direct feedback loop

Teresa Torres 3 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I think interviewing is a grossly underestimated skill. Grossly underestimated skill. So that's the first thing is that if you're not collecting rich stories in your interviews, it's going to be really hard to identify opportunities."  Tactical:  Avoid asking direct questions out of context (e.g., 'What do you like to watch?')Ask for specific instances (e.g., 'Tell me about the last time you watched a movie')Ground the interview in behavior to get reliable data    "The most common strategy is to allow your customers to opt in while they're using your product or service... instead of saying, 'Would you recommend our product or service to a friend or colleague?' it says, 'Do you have 20 minutes to talk to us?' If they say yes, you send them some scheduling software, they pick a time on your calendar, and voila."  Tactical:  Embed interview invites directly in the product flowUse scheduling software (like Calendly) to let users pick times automaticallyFor B2B, define triggers for sales/support teams to schedule interviews on your behalf    "I teach in our interviewing class, you really don't have to think about what to ask. You could run an entire interview by asking them one question... 'Tell me about the last time you watched something on a streaming entertainment service.'... All I have to do is just be curious about your experience. What I'm doing with my questions is just helping you tell the timeline."  Tactical:  Start with one broad story-based questionUse 'What happened next?' to move the story forwardSummarize what you heard to show you are listening and bring them back to specific moments

"We refer to it as dollar-driven discovery. We get very specific about not just the normal way of doing customer conversations and customer discovery, but how do you find that a customer is willing to pay money for this thing and a lot of money?"  Tactical:  Ask 'What is a fair price?', 'What would be an expensive price?', and 'What would be a prohibitively expensive price?' to find the true willingness to pay.Look for 'wow statements' or requests for follow-up meetings as high-signal indicators of interest.Ask 'Where would a budget for this come from?' to identify if there is an existing line item or if you are displacing another tool.    "I need your help. It is very important to me that this company succeeds and does not fail. So I don't want you to be nice to me. I want you to tell me is Persona a necessity for your company? If we went away, how painful would that be? If a competitor came along that charged half as much as us, would you switch to them?"  Tactical:  Explicitly ask customers if they would switch to a cheaper competitor to test if your product is a 'necessity' or a 'nice-to-have'.

"Back in the day, we were doing studio visits with sellers. We were going to their workshops, we were going to their homes.

Is this interesting?'"

"Literally had a Slack integration that we pulled in a whole bunch of information about anyone who signed up for Airtable... and literally would sit there and had a little button in each of the records that came in that would allow us to email them immediately... 'Hey, we'd really love to get your feedback.'"  Tactical:  Integrate signup data into a real-time feed (e.g., Slack) for immediate outreachTarget specific titles or companies for high-touch feedback sessionsUse early conversations to help users build their first 'durable' workflow    "The simplest way to do this is to write a template email for yourself...

I know it is important that it's on the phone and not a survey because you get way more instinct from unstructured conversation."  Tactical:  Automate the process of finding and emailing users for feedbackPrioritize phone calls over surveys to capture nuance and instinctCommit to a weekly or monthly quota of customer conversations

"I still remember distinctly flying down to LA with Kevin Systrom to go do a user research study... there's no substitute for that... you can't empathize with the summary. You have to be in the room fully immersed, no phones, just actually hearing the words and the intonation."  Tactical:  Participate in user research sessions personally rather than reading summariesObserve users in their natural environment (e.g., driving for Uber) to feel their pain points
