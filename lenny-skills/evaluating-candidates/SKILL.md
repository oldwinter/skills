Evaluating Candidates  Evaluation is where hiring succeeds or fails. The goal isn't to find a unicorn who excels at everything. It's to build a balanced team by hiring for complementary skills and identifying candidates with the specific traits that predict success in your environment.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 94 experts.

1 Hire for team balance, not individual perfection  A competency model should identify gaps in your current team, not search for someone who's excellent at everything. Evaluate candidates against the specific skills your team needs, not against an impossible ideal. Great teams are complementary portfolios, not collections of clones.

Featured guest perspectives

"The goal of the competency model is not to find a unicorn human being that is an 11 out of 10 on every one of these things, because frankly, that person doesn't exist... The goal is to create a well-rounded team so that you're hiring and balancing skills across your team."

— Adam Fishman        2 Prioritize agency and clock speed over experience  In fast-moving environments, high agency and processing speed predict success better than years of experience. Look for candidates who ask great questions, have tried your product deeply, and bring energy to every interaction. Experience can be a crutch when the ground is shifting.

Featured guest perspectives

"I saw some of the highest performers just being people that had very high agency, had that clock speed, had that energy, but they didn't necessarily need to have deep experience on that matter. Sometimes experience could be a crutch, especially in this world where the grounds are shifting so fast with AI."

— Albert Cheng        3 Look for signals outside the formal interview  High agency reveals itself in how candidates communicate during scheduling, the quality of their questions about your product, and their proactive research. The best signal often comes from observing behavior when they don't think they're being evaluated.

Featured guest perspectives

"A lot of it actually happens outside of the interview process interestingly. So a lot of it is the types of questions they asked, 'Have they actually tried your product and gone deep into it?' A lot of it is, it's the references, it's the communication that they have to even set up your interview, it's the energy they bring."

— Albert Cheng        4 Use work trials to verify capabilities  Extended work simulations reveal what interviews cannot. Having candidates join real work for a day or even a week lets you see how they think through unfamiliar problems and how they collaborate with your team. This is especially valuable for technical and creative roles.

Featured guest perspectives

"I pretty much always have people join the work simulation for at least a day, often a full week."

— Anton Osika        5 Apply intuition after structure, not before  Your gut instinct is valuable but only after you've completed structured evaluation. Going through a rigorous rubric first ensures you don't miss important data. Then intuition can break ties between candidates who scored similarly on objective criteria.

Featured guest perspectives

"And then what he found was after you've gone through that process, if you then use your intuition after having done that, not before, that then you actually can really drastically improve your hit rate on hiring."

— Annie Duke

✗ Common Mistakes

Searching for candidates who are excellent at everything instead of filling specific team gapsUsing school pedigree as a proxy for capabilityRelying on gut feeling before completing structured evaluationIgnoring signals from outside the formal interview process     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

You can articulate exactly which competencies each new hire adds to the teamCandidates who decline your offers cite fit rather than your evaluation processNew hires ramp up quickly because their skills matched your assessment

"The goal of the competency model is not to find a unicorn human being that is an 11 out of 10 on every one of these things, because frankly, that person doesn't exist... The goal is to create a well-rounded team so that you're hiring and balancing skills across your team and that you don't have any gaps in your portfolio."  Tactical:  Identify specific skill gaps in the current team before opening a roleEvaluate candidates against a balanced portfolio of execution, strategy, and communication    "I tend to skew more towards internal hire to be perfectly honest, because I believe in creating opportunity inside a company... I also believe that helping people transition into new roles is a way to get more people into the practice. One of the benefits that you get from that is a lot of time they have one of those competencies really nailed already. Could be like customer knowledge."  Tactical:  Look for internal candidates with high execution and customer knowledge to transition into growth rolesInvest in outside education or advisors to bridge the gap for internal transfers who lack specific growth strategy experience

Sometimes experience could be a crutch, especially in this world where the grounds are shifting so fast with AI."  Tactical:  Prioritize high agency and energy over years of experience in shifting industries like AI.Look for candidates who can intentionally discard old habits.    "A lot of it actually happens outside of the interview process interestingly. So a lot of it is the types of questions they asked, 'Have they actually tried your product and gone deep into it?' A lot of it is, it's the references, it's the communication that they have to even set up your interview, it's the energy they bring into the conversation."  Tactical:  Evaluate the quality and depth of the candidate's questions about the product.Observe the candidate's communication style and energy during the scheduling and logistics phase.

Adam Grenier 2 quotes

"Anything let's say C or below, comfortable with chaos and willingness to go do something they have not done for probably 15 years are two huge signals for me, because every company I've been part of at every scale now... that's the thing that a lot of people coming from more traditional marketing environments into startup worlds, it's a pace and just the unpredictability and change."  Tactical:  Test candidates for their comfort level with high rates of unpredictabilityLook for senior leaders who are still willing to execute tactical tasks (e.g., writing emails, checking ad data)    "Every marketer is going to have a T-shaped career... find out their T, find out their strength, and then spend time figuring out how they make up for those other things."  Tactical:  Identify the candidate's primary deep skill (the vertical bar of the T)Ask how they plan to hire or adapt to cover the areas where they are not experts

"Tell me about a project you're proud of. Tell me about a project you're proud of, is just really open-ended and get to hear a lot about a lot of things that way. And then maybe runner up is tell me about a campaign you recently come across that you were not involved with that you thought was cool."  Tactical:  Ask candidates to detail a project they are proud of to see what they prioritizeAsk about external campaigns to gauge their marketing 'eye' and awareness

"I had this belief that sort of these people that I had seen, many of whom have now gone on to start companies that are doing quite well, would be incredible value add... I'd be like, 'If you've been a founder before, even if your startup has failed, please apply to this.'"  Tactical:  Look for non-traditional candidates who are often screened out by standard big-tech algorithms.Explicitly invite former founders to apply in job descriptions.Be prepared for these hires to challenge organizational inefficiencies and likely leave within 2-3 years to start their next venture.

Austin Hay 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"The first thing that I always gravitate towards is just intellectual curiosity. And I know that's very, maybe a little bit overrated, but I think you can tell pretty quickly if somebody's just interested in the world and learning things. And the thing about third party tools is you are constantly learning. You'll never be an expert in everything because there's way too many tools to be an expert on"  Tactical:  Prioritize candidates who demonstrate a high interest in learning new systems quickly.Look for 'engineering scrappiness'—the ability to read API docs and make requests even without a CS degree.    "I look less for red flags and more for false identifiers on the resume application that may shortcut me towards the decision. Another one is just school people just look at your school where you went to undergrad or grad and they kind of make a decision one way or the other. And I feel like that's also can be a really bad shortcut."  Tactical:  Investigate resume gaps; they may represent periods of intense self-directed learning or personal growth.Ignore school pedigree in favor of demonstrated skills and curiosity.

Ben Williams 1 quote

"The devs that really thrive in a growth context are the ones that are motivated by moving quickly, iterating to create measurable impact. They're not attached to their work. They embrace imperfection as part of the process. They happily discard their code, their ideas even. They're curious and they're always looking for ways to be closer to their users."  Tactical:  Test for a candidate's willingness to discard code or ideas in favor of learningLook for engineers who prioritize speed and iteration over perfect architecture

"At Anthropic, I think we've been maybe much less affected than many of the other companies in the space because people here are so mission oriented and they stay because... They get these offers and then they say, 'Well, of course I'm not going to leave because my best case scenario at Meta is that we make money and my best case at Anthropic is we affect the future of humanity and try to make AI flourish and human flourishing go well.'"  Tactical:  Prioritize candidates who are mission-oriented over those primarily motivated by financial upsideFrame the role's impact in terms of societal benefit to differentiate from larger, profit-focused incumbents

"You don't make people great. You find people that make you great, that make the company great, that you learned from, not the other way around."  Tactical:  Hire for world-class expertise in functions you don't personally understand (e.g., CFO, HR)Look for candidates who can teach you and push the company forward independently    "Judge people on what they can do, coach people on what they can do, help them take their strengths and use them as opposed to over focus on their weaknesses... we're investing in strength, not lack of weakness. I want to know how good, are they world-class? Do they have a world-class strength? And can that beat anybody?"  Tactical:  Identify a candidate's 'world-class strength' and determine if it can beat the competitionSurround flawed but high-strength individuals with people who can mitigate their weaknesses

"I'm actually using the book as... If you want to apply for a job with me, we got to go through the process. And so basically they have to come to me and tell me their energy drivers and drains.

Tactical:  Ask candidates to identify their 'bottom five' strengths or areas that drain their energy.Look for honesty about what a candidate 'sucks at' as a sign of professional maturity and fit.

"On every interview loop there's one person, who is not the hiring manager, who doesn't report to the hiring manager, who's not the recruiting manager... and they are on the interview loop and they're a Bar Raiser, which means when we get to the debrief meeting, they will run that meeting, not the hiring manager, not the recruiter, they will run the meeting."  Tactical:  Appoint a Bar Raiser who is outside the hiring manager's reporting lineGive the Bar Raiser veto power to counteract 'urgency bias' in hiringHave the Bar Raiser lead the candidate debrief meeting to ensure objective criteria are used

Tactical:  Identify if the specific product challenge requires a technical, operational, or design-heavy PMAvoid hiring generalists for niche roles where specific context is the primary driver of success

Tactical:  Look for 'range' and generalist problem-solving abilities during interviews    "What are three to five adjectives that define this culture? What's the biggest problem in this culture...

"I think evidence that they actually have thought about it. As per I said earlier, that they've done research, that they have opinions, that they care about it. Right?

Tactical:  Look for evidence of deep research into the problem spaceTest for strong, well-reasoned opinions rather than generic statementsDifferentiate between 'superficial' answers and those with 'soul' and care

"I'm an intellectually very fearless person, and I have to say when I hire young people, I look for that because I think that's a very important quality if one wants to make a difference, is that when you want to make a difference, you have to accept that you're creating something new or you're diving into something new."  Tactical:  Look for candidates who are willing to dive into new, unproven areas without over-analyzing failure cases.Prioritize passion and mission alignment over minute job details during the hiring process.

"We're very much looking for people that are embracing these tools and that are eager to try and learn from it. ...

"The seniority gap is really rough... what you do in response typically is, you promote a lot of people internally... But it's a problem because suddenly people are solving problems through trial and error... you want to keep it roughly in balance... 50-50, whatever."  Tactical:  Maintain a balance (roughly 50/50) between high-potential internal promotes and experienced external hires.Pair high-potential talent with 'been there, done that' leaders to accelerate the aggregate learning rate of the company.

"Everyone is striving for talented, skillful, smart people. Revolut values way more raw intellect and this unquenched hunger to build things rather than experience."  Tactical:  Look for 'unquenched hunger' to build thingsValue raw intellect over specific domain experience    "Unfortunately, professionals with a lot of years of experience from established companies, they don't have this strong urge to change status quo, which by the way will require toil, tears, and sweat. And that's why even if a candidate doesn't have a lot of years of experience, but they love building things, they've done it, they worked with engineers maybe by the way, maybe in their own startup or one of the best profiles that I've seen is a tech co-founder."  Tactical:  Target former tech co-founders as high-potential product hiresScreen for candidates who have a history of building things from scratch with small teams    "One of the great sources is actually looking into products and apps that we love ourselves. So if someone built a great product, then it's likely a high performer. So usually we provide some great products in specific areas that are more important for us to the sourcing team and they just try to source targeting those companies."  Tactical:  Identify apps or products with exceptional UX and target their product teamsDirect sourcing teams to focus on specific companies known for product excellence

"we have to build all of this technology in order to measure it, like thousands of signals on all of our workers, thousands of signals on every project, every task. We know at the end of the day, if you are good at writing poetry versus good at writing essays versus great at writing technical documentation... We are looking at your keyboard strokes. We are looking how fast you answer things. We are using reviews, we are using code standards"  Tactical:  Track behavioral signals (speed, keystrokes, patterns) to identify true expertiseSegment talent based on specific vertical performance (e.g., poetry vs. technical docs)

"But second of all, we do a lot of trials for people. So trial work to see them in action for a couple of days. We pay them as part of the work trial. We have some probation periods that we start people on, because this company is not for everybody."  Tactical:  Implement 2-3 day paid work trials to observe how candidates handle chaos and lack of clarity.Screen for 'fire in the belly' and passion rather than just big-company logos on a resume.    "It's also interesting that there's a really high demand for ex-founders now, for those people that truly have a lot of agency and high autonomy... the failed startup founders are now hot demand for a lot of these AI companies."  Tactical:  Prioritize hiring former founders who can operate autonomously without needing corporate structure.    "There is a huge misconception in the field that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team. To figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it, it's not something that you can outsource to somebody."  Tactical:  Wait until the company reaches a milestone like $1M to $10M in ARR before building a dedicated growth team.Ensure the founder leads the first wave of growth rather than outsourcing it to a new hire.    "If you have the overall business slowing down, your head of growth is destined to fail because the reason business is slowing down is much deeper than not having a growth team."  Tactical:  Address core product and marketing issues before hiring growth leadership to avoid setting them up for failure.Look for signs of a plateau or 'signs of life' in specific pockets before investing in a growth team to accelerate results.

Tactical:  Look for candidates who bring additive skills that the current team lacksEvaluate if a candidate will push the team's thinking rather than just fitting into a box    "I'm usually looking for the person who would be better in my role than I am in my role. So I often ask people what would their priorities be, what would they do differently if they had my job."

"Find out what month one looks like with them. If month one is them just doing intake calls and learning about the company... you're not going to necessarily want to partner with an agency that needs a three-month ramp up cycle."  Tactical:  Ask for a tactical breakdown of the first 30 days of the engagementAvoid agencies that require long ramp-up periods before starting outreach    "Ask them for a couple recent blogs or releases, whatever they tend to go for, and read those. And, of course, wins too. You want to see what kind of stories they're getting, but that's a little more obvious."

"I think having the right business model experience is almost more important than having industry experience or experience with that audience. And I think often people are like, I need someone who is marketed to HR or marketed to construction or that specific. And my response is you, you're going to really narrow your set up people with that, and also it doesn't matter as much because great marketers learn the audience and learn the product quickly."  Tactical:  Screen for experience with your specific go-to-market motion (top-down vs. bottom-up).Don't over-index on industry-specific backgrounds as great marketers can learn new audiences quickly.    "You want the first marketer to be an expert in one of those three areas that I mentioned, product marketing, content marketing, growth marketing. And you want them to be proficient in another one, the second T. But you want them to be able to set strategy and know how to hire contractors across all of them. And so the promise land of hiring a first marketer, they are a pie shape marketer."  Tactical:  Look for 'pie-shaped' profiles (expertise in 2 areas, strategic knowledge in others) rather than T-shaped (expertise in only 1).Evaluate their ability to hire and manage specialized contractors for areas where they aren't experts.    "I think I want to see that they've worked on a team that's early enough where they are not siloed into their specific role. Because what happens at leader stage companies or at public companies is when you're a product marketer, you don't see what's going on in the rest of marketing at all."  Tactical:  Look for candidates from growth-stage companies who had exposure to multiple marketing functions.Verify they are 'doers' who are comfortable building from scratch rather than just managing existing systems.

"The biggest thing I see particularly at higher levels is people talk about what they have done but not why it mattered. They don't talk about the impact.

"The first PM at every company has been someone who's either been an analyst or an engineer or a designer who's worked there already and they just move from their role to being a PM. Why? Because many cases, the role of the PM is actually to be the liaison between the founder, founders and the engineering team."  Tactical:  Look for internal candidates with high curiosity, customer centricity, and communication skills to transition into the first PM roleHire the first PM when you reach 8-10 engineers to ensure the team is properly 'cared for and fed'    "Look at best of class companies or companies that are best of class at that function in the similar space... You don't hire the person, the head of marketing at these companies. You hire the person who's reporting to them, the lieutenant."  Tactical:  Map out the org charts of best-in-class companies using LinkedInTarget the 'up and coming' talent who have seen scale but are ready for a step up in responsibility    "A founder of a young company should spend I think two hours a day hiring... one hour a day doing the reach outs... The second hour should be devoted to actually meeting one or two people on a daily basis."  Tactical:  Spend one hour on 'low-energy' sourcing/outreach and one hour on 'high-energy' interviewsUse the weekend to catch up on additional recruiting meetings if necessary

"We made a pretty big push in something we call skills-first hiring. This was the idea that we could translate people's experiences into a set of skills, and by that we could help them really start balancing the marketplace with a much different system."  Tactical:  Translate candidate experiences into a discrete set of skillsIdentify transferable skills between seemingly unrelated industries (e.g., hospitality to customer service)    "I do like to ask people what the most complex thing they ever built was. I just love to understand mostly, what do they gravitate to? Is there something you gravitate to? And two, are they able to simplify it? I think those are two really important skills."

So the last five finalists will do a project for us. We'll pay them to do the project, they'll have a week to do it, they'll do it, and then I'll critique it with them. Even if I love it, I will push back in certain areas."  Tactical:  Pay finalists to complete a one-week projectConduct a live critique of the work sample to see how the candidate riffs on ideasAsk 'If you had another couple days, what would you do with this?' to test their vision and instincts

This is so important. This is a recipe for utter disaster. If you've, take someone in sales and their last product was easier to sell, they will have none of the skills to sell your product."

"The candidate poll must match where you want the team to go. It's not a down funnel problem, it is an up funnel problem. And where you have to just make sure that for each role you're comfortable with the distribution of people and backgrounds in your candidate pool."  Tactical:  Monitor the diversity of the candidate pool for every role before proceeding to interviews.

"An important part of the case study is that it's actually too complex for people to have all of the answers upfront... seeing how people react to that is really indicative of how deeply they understand a new problem or how quickly or how mentally agile they are."  Tactical:  Design case studies that are too large to solve perfectly in the allotted timeChange an assumption mid-interview to see how the candidate adapts their logic

"I really look for that curiosity and that self-motivation to do it without being told. ... The person that has that curiosity, something seems off, something doesn't really make sense and goes and proactively looks into what that is."  Tactical:  Test for curiosity by presenting a case with a subtle anomaly to see if the candidate notices and investigates.Ask for specific examples where a candidate noticed something 'off' in data and pursued it without being prompted.    "Seeing how people react to being told they're wrong is a really important signal in my opinion. Seeing how people respond, how they're able to take new information and pivot, how they're able to make a decision."  Tactical:  Intentionally challenge a candidate's assumption during a case study to observe their reaction.Push candidates to make a definitive 'call' or decision even when they lack perfect information.

"I would look at, do the co-founders get along? Are these people committed? And if a founder would get defensive, that was always a bad sign."  Tactical:  Observe if co-founders interrupt each other or finish each other's sentencesWatch for defensive reactions to questioning as a sign of a closed mind    "I would look at other things about founders. When we'd have these 10-minute interviews, I would look at, do the co-founders get along? Are these people committed? Do they really know about their product? Do they care? Are they going to quit their job? Or are they telling us that they are going to quit their job, but really aren't? All these little social cues that I'd try to pick up on."  Tactical:  Verify if founders are actually prepared to quit their current jobsAssess if founders have a deep connection to the problem they are solving    "If a founder would get defensive, that was always a bad sign, always a bad sign. The best founders would say, 'Gosh, I have thought about it and here's what I figured out.' Or, they just have this almost a tennis match and a conversation rather than closing up and feeling like, oh, this person's interrogating me. You could just sort of, the open-mindedness, the flexible-mindedness of people was really important."  Tactical:  Test for open-mindedness by questioning the founder's core assumptionsLook for founders who treat questioning as a 'tennis match' of ideas    "One founder, once we asked a question and one person started to respond and the other founder put his arm in front of him and said, 'I'll answer that question.' And it was just so weird that he wouldn't let his co-founder speak. We'd have situations where we'd call people like hackers in a cage, where it's kind of obvious there'd be a business founder, business person, who had clearly convinced a programmer to join the team. They were given, the programmer was given, very little equity and just we called them programmers in a cage, like hackers in a cage."  Tactical:  Check for massive gaps in equity allocation (e.g., 99% vs 1%)Observe if one founder physically or verbally suppresses the other during the interview    "Earnestness is one of the most important because earnest, sort of to me, is bucketed with authenticity. And to be a successful startup founder, you have to care so much about the problem you're trying to solve, the users you're serving and being earnest about it is so key to success."  Tactical:  Look for founders who are fixing their own problem in a broken industryIdentify if a founder is honest about what they don't know    "Confidence means you can say, 'I've thought about that and I don't know the answer.' That's confidence. And they'll say, 'But here's what I do to try to figure it out. Here are my plans to address that.'"  Tactical:  Distinguish between defensive posturing and genuine confidenceAsk difficult questions to see if the candidate can admit they don't know the answer    "I love co-founders that have a history together; either they went to school together, they went to college together, work together, maybe they're siblings. Because when you have a long-term relationship, you trust each other and you know each other's weaknesses, and you're usually on the same page with your aspirations and everything. It's really scary when two founders get together just to start the startup and don't have any history."  Tactical:  Prioritize teams with a long-term pre-existing relationshipBe wary of 'arranged' co-founder relationships formed solely to start a company

"If you're making your first hire, you probably want them to have the ingenuity and capability to solve a lot of the problems that you're going to run into within the context of tracking, attribution, data visualization, and then campaign management. Number one, do they have a technical background?"  Tactical:  Prioritize candidates with technical aptitudes in math, finance, or full-stack engineeringLook for candidates who can solve tracking and data visualization problems independently    "I'll ask the question of, 'How many windows are there in New York City?'... One is can they think on their feet? I'm not actually looking for the correct answer... also from a client services point of view, I'm trying to see whether in a scenario where I've asked them something that they obviously probably weren't prepared for... they can compose themselves in a difficult situation."  Tactical:  Use logic-based thought experiments to test mental arithmetic and problem-solving frameworksObserve the candidate's emotional reaction to unexpected or 'weird' questions to gauge professional composure

"You should hire people who have already done the thing you need to have done next."  Tactical:  Look for evidence of the specific outcomes you need in the candidate's past roles.Avoid 'gambling' on big-name resumes (e.g., Meta, Salesforce) without verifying specific relevant achievements.    "If you were an outstanding performer in Job A, it is a high likelihood that in job B, someone associated with you in job A is going to pull you into the next thing and then pull you into the next thing and pull you into the next thing and you'll never do a job search 'cause you were great."  Tactical:  Look for a career history where the candidate was repeatedly recruited by former managers or peers.Identify if the candidate has a history of creating 'raving fans' among their previous employers.    "We think there are three types of executives that startups end up hiring over time. We call them the architect, the optimizer, and the scaler."  Tactical:  Hire an 'Architect' when you need to build a playbook from scratch alongside the founder.Hire an 'Optimizer' when you need to find efficiency and performance in an existing playbook (scaling from a few to ~15 people).Hire a 'Scaler' when you need to find massive leverage and 10x the organization.

Tactical:  Test candidates with open-ended research problems to see if they suggest multi-method approaches.Look for the 'five tools': generative research, evaluative research, survey design, applied statistics, and technical data skills (SQL/Prompt Engineering).

Make yourself out to be someone who cares about design... go and study it. Go and interview designers that work at companies. Go and try and follow the top designers on Twitter."  Tactical:  Learn the specific tools and language designers use to speak to them in a common languageDemonstrate design commitment by investing in high-quality marketing sites or early product V1s    "If we were going to create a team and we're going to have a couple engineers and none of them are very good at thinking through product requirements or what the user angle is, we probably do need to supplement the team with somebody with that skill set."  Tactical:  Identify missing skills (e.g., product thinking, user empathy) within an existing team before hiring.

"The key, I think, to keep in mind is it's easier to teach tools and process than it is taste and character, so I would certainly pay a lot of attention to that. Their hit rate for great judgment and great taste, and how they've honed that, even if they're not very experienced, just to see do they have that natural inclination for great things."  Tactical:  Look for a 'natural inclination for great things' even in less experienced candidatesEvaluate 'hit rate' for judgment in past work    "Tell me what work you are most proud of. And the reason I ask that is because it helps me understand their taste and their judgment, what motivates them, what work they view as good and as a good outcome. It also helps me understand a little bit about what they like to do and where their gravity pulls them."  Tactical:  Use the 'most proud of' question to gauge what a candidate considers a 'good outcome'

"I actually feel like maybe the pendulum shifted way too far now where it's the interview process is so structured. Everyone's doing all these mock. They know exactly what questions they're going to get. It's SAT prep. Everyone's ready. But we've missed out with can they do the job? Because it's like they can pass the interview, but can they do the job?"  Tactical:  Focus on 'intangibles' and the 'art' of the role rather than just technical scienceEvaluate if the candidate can actually work with and inspire engineers and designersLook for evidence of leadership without formal authority    "I think a great question... is how does the company define a product team? Because it answers so much. It says so much about culture, collaboration, decision-making, the role of product management. If there's one question and you could figure out what is this culture like, it would be asking that."  Tactical:  Ask candidates (or have candidates ask) how the company defines a product team to reveal culture and decision-making norms    "I think another great question for candidates is to ask them to pick an example of something they've shipped recently and just talk about how it came to be. How did the bill become a law? Was it somebody in sales yelled and it got added to the backlog and it was the next thing? Is it a group of people together understanding customer user needs through discovery and ideating and trying some things and testing it?"  Tactical:  Ask candidates to walk through 'how the bill became a law' for a recent feature to understand their environment and empowerment level

"We've been taking very slow steps on it that in almost the first year we didn't hire anyone... We never more than doubled in a year. And that's been our guideline that we shouldn't more than double."  Tactical:  Set a hard cap on hiring (e.g., never more than doubling in a year) to maintain culture.Prioritize high-caliber generalists over a large number of average specialists.    "We do with all of the employees, we've been doing a paid work trial... they basically come as a mini contractor to the company, and we give them a very usually fairly vague problem statements. If you're an engineer, it's like, hey, there's this feature that needs to be built. How would you build it? Then go build it."  Tactical:  Implement a multi-day paid work trial as the final step in the hiring process.Give candidates access to the real codebase and Slack to see how they collaborate and handle ambiguity.

"I think sometimes putting the most unlikely people who have an ounce of naivety to what it takes to win and succeed are the ones that are going to drive the biggest impact."  Tactical:  Look for generalists who aren't bound by 'the way things have always been done.'Consider candidates from completely different industries (e.g., hiring a news anchor for marketing).    "I definitely look for people who have the ability to make decisions and move fast and not get worried about the outcome. That is the biggest learning in a startup. The secret is momentum and just keeping momentum... I look for just optimistic doers."  Tactical:  Screen for 'optimistic doers' who are willing to roll up their sleeves.Watch for red flags like candidates who are overly concerned with 'lanes' or say 'I don't do that.'

"Regardless of whether or not you're hiring, you should always be keeping a pulse on the market. That is the most important thing. And I think that should be the case for both candidates and folks that are hiring. Like, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have no idea what good looks like, whether that's from a company standpoint or from a candidate standpoint."  Tactical:  Chat with 'benchmark' candidate profiles even when not hiring to understand the bar.Keep a pulse on which companies are thriving and which individuals are building great things.    "I think especially for founders that haven't hired for this caliber of talent in the past, it's really easy to be distracted by shiny objects and look at huge names. You want to find the CPOs of Google and YouTube or what have you because that seems like it would be such an incredible opportunity for brand recognition. And to an extent, it is. But the fact of the matter is, oftentimes those individuals are pretty far from the work and have a great team of executors that they've put into place that are actually the ones that are in the weeds."  Tactical:  Look for candidates who are closer to the work and have a 'chip on their shoulder' to prove themselves.Prioritize 'innovative AB testing' profiles over purely operational or camaraderie-focused leaders for pre-IPO stages.    "I would say the general advice is who is going to be best for this specific role at this specific time, not necessarily who is the best talent in the world or in the market. Those are two very, very different questions to ask."  Tactical:  Evaluate if a candidate's recent experience (e.g., team building vs. shipping) matches your current 12-18 month needs.    "It is important to dig pretty deep and ask the hard questions. ... Why would I not hire this person? What are their biggest weaknesses? And then if they give you the typical, 'Oh, if they work too hard,' it's like, no, tell me more. What are their actual weaknesses? What are things that we should be really cognizant of? Would you hire this person again? Would you report to this person?"  Tactical:  Ask references: 'Why would I NOT hire this person?'Ask: 'Would you report to this person?'Pay close attention to slight pauses or hesitations in the reference's voice.    "Back channel references I think will always provide a greater source of truth than provided. It's similar to an Instagram Reel as opposed to the photos you're tagged in. That's the way I think of it. It's like this is what you want the world to see or think of you as, and then these are what your peers and your direct reports and the people around you actually say about the work that you did during this time."  Tactical:  Prioritize back-channeling through your own network over calling the candidate's list of references.Look for impact that cross-functional leaders and direct reports can specifically speak to.

"I'm looking for what I call signs of excellence. So I want to know the top people generally have done multiple amazing things in their life, repeated success, not just once. Maybe it was work related, maybe not work related."  Tactical:  Look for at least three 'signs of excellence' in a candidate's historyIdentify non-work achievements that demonstrate grit, drive, and the ability to succeed    "One of them is when somebody's boss leaves the company and then comes back to poach them, that is such a strong signal because if you think of what just happened, the leader who knows exactly how good this person you're talking to is... they would never do that unless this person was really, really good."  Tactical:  Check if a candidate has been recruited by former managers to new companiesWeight the 'poaching signal' heavily as it implies a high reputational risk taken by the hiring manager

"Early on one of the first questions I would ask people is, what are the KPIs that you're willing to commit to? So if someone's only willing to commit to lead numbers, that's not good enough. They need to be able to commit to closed one revenue KPRs to really show that they care about the business's bottom line."  Tactical:  Ask candidates what KPIs they have committed to in the past and what they believe they should be measured on.    "A really good way to also test for that is, this is more on the case study process, but asking someone to come up with a strategy with $0, with $10,000 and maybe a hundred thousand dollars to see if they're going to be able to scale with you. And to see how are they thinking about with different levels of spend and what are they willing to commit to at different levels of spend."  Tactical:  Test how candidates prioritize channels when resources are zero versus when they are abundant.

"Core to how we interview too, is actually, we have people onsite for two days, and do a project with us, a work test project. And that has worked really well, that increasingly you're finding that... It gives you two days of seeing a real work product, and it doesn't have to be incredibly time-enhancing other teams from time."  Tactical:  Use a canned list of real-world projects rather than using candidate time for actual company IP.Spread the evaluation over two days to see how the candidate handles end-to-end tasks and team interaction.Use the time to evaluate 'disposition'—intellectual honesty, curiosity, and level-headedness.

"For a standard PM role, I always make people do work... I really use that as a way to see into how someone thinks, the quality of the solutions that they bring, how they communicate. There's just so much bundled up in giving someone an actual problem, ideally to pick, not one that's assigned to them."  Tactical:  Use take-home assignments or work samples for all PM hires.Give candidates a choice of 3 different problems to solve to see what they gravitate toward.    "Whether someone was able to tell a compelling story was huge, especially at Slack, which was a very product-driven company, a very narrative-driven company. If you were going to present data, it needed to be within a very specific context. And it wasn't a company where the number always won. It was a company where the story always won."

"I feel like they screened really hard for a few traits in particular. One is like very independent-minded people who weren't afraid to push back. Two is people with broader intellectual interests... And then yeah, I think three is just people who are very intensely competitive."  Tactical:  Look for candidates who question the frame of the interview and think for themselves.Identify people with broad interests outside of their core professional function.Prioritize an intensely competitive 'win at all costs' mentality for high-growth environments.    "You ask questions like, what's the hardest you've ever worked to get something done and why? And that does differentiate a lot of people, a lot of people don't actually have a great answer to that."  Tactical:  Ask for specific examples of extreme effort to gauge intrinsic motivation.Filter for mission alignment by finding people with personal or 'private' reasons to care about the problem space.

"Curiosity is a very important quality when I'm actually talking to my interviewers because I want to see that they are naturally curious to new things. They want to learn more about the new things and don't really get stuck with their own things. That's one thing. And the other thing is the discipline... One of the good example that is the ability to prioritize because I don't believe one thing is everybody can do everything."  Tactical:  Test for curiosity by seeing if candidates are naturally interested in learning things outside their immediate scope.Evaluate a candidate's ability to prioritize as a core competency for fast-moving environments.    "The first mistake I made was... we're trying to grow too fast and sometimes as a hiring manager I have to compromise the standard we're trying to hire. So that's the mistakes I think I made first and I think nobody should repeat that mistake is you need to always run for the quality rather than the quantity."

"I generally value the reference check over interview signals. If I had to stack rank in interviews, what is the best signal? The reference check is the top of the list. Those people, they worked with this person sometimes for years, their knowledge, what you're going to get out of 30 minutes of artificial scenarios it's just like never going to compare what a good reference check will give you."  Tactical:  Prioritize reference checks over interview performance in the final decision.Look for signals from people who have worked with the candidate for years.    "Gusto does this thing in their hiring calls. So you get an offer from Gusto and apparently when you get on the offer call of congratulations, you got an offer, instead of just meeting the recruiter, which is what most companies do, they have the entire group of people that interviewed you join the call and they all say something about why you're amazing and you should join Gusto."  Tactical:  Have the full interview panel join the offer call to share specific reasons why they want the candidate to join.    "We ended up settling on this one called PSHE, and it comes from old mentor of mine, Quentin Clark... And it stands for Problem, Solution, How, Execution, PSHE... If you're a junior product manager, what happens? You get handed a problem. You get handed a solution. You get handed the how... and all you have to do is execute... At some point you're senior enough that you tell us the problems and you say, 'Hey. I know you told me to go work on activation, but actually I think our issue is brand,'"  Tactical:  Evaluate candidates based on where they fall on the PSHE (Problem, Solution, How, Execution) spectrum.Recognize that seniority is often defined by the ability to move from 'Execution' to 'Problem' identification.    "I try really hard to do is to draw contrasts... I'll say things like, 'When you think about this person, and I'll give you four different personas. Someone who's regularly coming up with the problems that the team should be focused on. Someone who given a set of problems is constantly solving them in this really creative way. The person that is just really good at getting a team moving. Or the person who can take a playbook and execute it with high precision and high quality and stuff.'"  Tactical:  Use contrasting personas during reference calls to avoid leading questions.Ask references: 'What questions should I have asked that I didn't?'Ask: 'How excitedly would you hire this person again?'

"Especially at the senior levels, I always ask them, when was one time that you failed and what did you learn from it? I've seen that folks who has either say that they've never failed or they're trying a success story as a failure story are usually, they're disingenuous or have not had the depth of experience."  Tactical:  Ask candidates for a specific instance of failure and the resulting lessons learned.Be wary of candidates who provide 'success stories' disguised as failures or claim they have never failed.

"Every single time I've taken a job where it turned out that I was working with people who had a different set of values or working styles than I had, I knew. You tell yourself that, at least in my case, I tell myself a story about why the thing I suspect might be the case isn't the case. But you do this in your personal life all the time."  Tactical:  Trust your gut feeling when assessing cultural fitDon't ignore red flags by rationalizing them away during the hiring process

"I'm a big fan of case studies, live case studies. I think you learn a whole boatload about how someone thinks on the fly, how they react to constraints... The other one I like to ask is around something that people have taught themselves, tried to get at a growth mindset."  Tactical:  Use live case studies to observe real-time problem-solving.Ask candidates what they have recently taught themselves to gauge curiosity.

"Every time that you hire someone new, mark your calendars for 30 days down the road and ask yourself one question, knowing what I know today, would I hire this person? If the answer is no, fire them immediately."  Tactical:  Set a calendar reminder for 30 days after every new hire to evaluate them.Ask: 'Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person?'    "Assuming XYZ person is going to leave, how sore are you going to feel?" And you will be surprised that they are going to tell you, "Oh, it's not a big deal." This is your confirmation."  Tactical:  Ask top-performing team members how they would feel if a specific candidate left to get confirmation on their performance.    "Speak with the reference... Would you hire him? Or would you hire her, right? So essentially at the end of the day you want to nail it into yes or no."  Tactical:  Ask references: 'Would you hire this person again?'If they say yes, ask 'Why didn't you?' to test their sincerity.

"I want the company to almost be like this dehydrated entity. Every hire is like a little bit of water, and we only go back and hire someone when we're back to being dehydrated."  Tactical:  Wait for existing team members to explicitly signal they are at capacity before opening a roleTreat every hire as a precious resource rather than a default growth metric    "We only hire for a role if we're actually underwater for that function... I actually think this is a feature. When you hire for a role and you already have enough people there, you get a lot of weird politics that ultimately ends up happening. And it's not because people are bad people... they will go out and manufacture some other thing that they should go work on."  Tactical:  Avoid hiring ahead of the curve to prevent the creation of low-value 'busy work'Use under-staffing as a forcing function for ruthless prioritization    "One of the biggest dog whistles I hear is, when I ask people how hard are you willing to work, some people actually ultimately say, 'Hey, I work very smart.' And I basically ask them a question, 'If we have many smart people at our company that also work hard, what's the differentiator going to be? Are you just going to pull them down?'"  Tactical:  Screen for candidates who are willing to work hard and are passionate about the missionFilter out candidates who use 'working smart' as an excuse to avoid high-intensity environments

"If you are very patient, there's always some trade-off between speed and quality when hiring. And I remember especially for our first 10 people, we were just so patient and disciplined about finding some of the best people in the world."  Tactical:  Be disciplined and patient when hiring the first 10 employeesPrioritize 'extraordinary backgrounds' and former founders for early-stage hires    "Speed becomes more important once you find the market opportunity, the market vacuum. ... once you know that there's so much more demand than you can handle, that's when you want to step on the gas and optimize for speed in a lot of ways."  Tactical:  Transition to rapid hiring once product-market fit and high demand are confirmedAccept higher variance in hiring to achieve necessary growth speed during scaling

"The kind of heuristic I have is if I ever think, should I fire this person even once, I should fire them immediately. It has always been a signal, at least for me, that when someone's a superstar, I can't imagine firing them."  Tactical:  Trust your gut signal: if you think about firing someone once, the relationship is likely already failing.Hire for immediate needs and proven experience rather than just 'potential.'Don't assume you can 'mentor' or 'coach' a poor fit into becoming a great employee.

"Interviews are not a good predictor of performance. We know this. We know this from studies... what I really like to do is use this race car analogy. If I told you, 'Hey, I want to go hire the best race car driver,' there's not really that many questions you could ask them except for put them in the car."  Tactical:  Use the first 30, 60, or 90 days as a high-stakes evaluation period to confirm fitImplement internship programs as long-term 'job trials' to observe real work product over months

"Our goal of interviews is to convince people not to join The Browser Company. If I have an interview with someone, I don't pitch them and say, 'What do you want to ask me? Anything you want? I'll be super honest, most people shouldn't want to work here.'"  Tactical:  Be brutally honest about the downsides and difficulties of the roleFocus on finding people who view the company as the place where they will do the defining work of their career

Keith Yandell 2 quotes

"The fact we were willing to go all the way down the path and have someone super qualified but didn't meet the culture bar, for him was what pushed him over the edge to join the company."  Tactical:  Prioritize cultural alignment over technical qualification if a candidate is perceived as a 'jerk' or 'aloof'Use specific company requirements (like delivery shifts) as a governor to filter for humility and customer obsession    "If you want to achieve a 10x outcome, hiring someone that's an expert in the field, it's maybe unlikely you're going to achieve that 10x outcome, because they're likely to do things the way things have always been done."  Tactical:  Look for 'Range' in candidates—people who have excelled in fields outside of the specific roleHire leaders who are comfortable admitting they aren't subject matter experts to empower their teams

"In 6 months, if I'm telling you what to do, I've hired the wrong person. It helps me and the person operate on a different level where the goal is not, did you hit this OKR? The Meta goal becomes, are we calibrating enough? Are we actually getting into a spot where in 6 months you're the one telling me what needs to be done?"  Tactical:  Use the '6-month rule' as a high bar for hiring decisionsCommunicate this expectation early to set a growth trajectory    "I think there are five different types of product managers... Number one is the consumer PM... half designer, half product person... Another type... is the growth PM... half data scientist, half product person... The third type is what I call the GM PM or the business PM... half MBA, half product person... Another one... is the platform PM... deeply wired to build tools for other people... The last one... research PM. These are half researcher, half engineer, half product person."  Tactical:  Evaluate candidates based on their primary and secondary archetypesMatch the PM archetype to the specific market or product stage (e.g., Platform PM for internal tools)    "The question I asked has been the same one I've asked for years... think about one of the biggest mistakes you've made, truly, the more painful the better. And tell me what the mistake was. Describe to me the situation, and tell me actually how you actually think differently now, work differently as a result."  Tactical:  Ask for a specific, painful mistake to test for authenticity and vulnerabilityLook for how the mistake transformed into a core operating principle

"Bring in people who know content and teach them process, as opposed to bringing in people who know process and trying to teach them content, because that's a bloody hard thing to do."  Tactical:  Evaluate if a candidate knows 'what to do when' rather than just 'how to run a process'Look for leaders who can still 'crawl up their sleeves' and do the work if their team disappeared

"We had a candidate who came and interviewed, he was a junior at MIT... we gave him an interview, and he did way better than almost any of the full-time candidates that we had ever talked to. And so, we said, hey, what do you think about taking some time off of school and working with us and building out Devin?"  Tactical:  Be prepared to offer non-traditional roles or paths (like leaving school) to 'outlier' candidates who outperform senior peersPrioritize interview performance over resume milestones    "And so, we actually worked with him and basically hand wrote all of his rejection responses to each of the other companies, and worked with him on it to say, here's how you should say it in a way that's going to come off as that you really did appreciate the time with them"  Tactical:  Help candidates manage their exit from other processes or current roles to build trust and rapportOffer personal assistance with difficult career conversations to demonstrate commitment to the candidate's success

"I can teach anyone how to do Google ads. I can teach anyone how to do Meta ads. That is not the hard part. It is the data part that is the hard part because there is so much noise going on in those accounts... what is the signal and what is the noise?"  Tactical:  Ask candidates to optimize an account based on a raw data dump during the interviewEvaluate if the candidate focuses on the primary goal (e.g., conversions) rather than vanity metrics like impressions or reach
