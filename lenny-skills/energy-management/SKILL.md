Energy Management  Energy management is the practice of optimizing your mental and emotional energy rather than just your time. High performers recognize that not all hours are equal - some activities energize you while others drain you. Managing this energy strategically is key to sustained performance and avoiding burnout.

Read Guide

The Guide  4 key steps synthesized from 5 experts.

1 Identify your energy drivers and drains  Pay close attention to how you feel after different activities - meetings, tasks, interactions. Some will leave you energized and ready to tackle more; others will feel like they sucked the life out of you. Document these patterns over a few weeks to build a clear map of what gives and takes energy.

Featured guest perspectives

"Think of moments where you actually go into a situation and you get energy from it... At the same time, the fact this is those moments where you go in and you get the life sucked out of you, that's an experience."

— Bob Moesta    "Pay really close attention to what gives you energy after you do the thing. Say you have a call. Did that give you energy or did that sap you of energy?"

— Paul Millerd        2 Schedule your calendar around energy, not just time  Once you know your energy patterns, restructure your calendar to optimize for energy rather than just efficiency. Schedule high-energy activities during your peak hours, batch energy-draining tasks together, and build in recovery time after demanding work. This approach allows you to maintain an abundant mindset in all situations.

Featured guest perspectives

"Being able to manage my energy levels and figuring out how to schedule my time for my energy has really allowed me also to figure out how to have that abundant mindset in all situations."

— Anneka Gupta        3 Audit your calendar and maximize zone-of-genius work  Categorize how you spend your time into buckets based on energy impact. Identify your 'zone of genius' - the work that energizes you and where you create the most value. Then systematically delegate, eliminate, or minimize the energy-draining tasks at the bottom of your list so you can spend more time in your zone.

Featured guest perspectives

"categorize the way you're spending your time into those buckets, and then put the bottom buckets away. Just focus on that top bucket and go, 'How can I be here more?'"

— Claire Vo        4 Use your superpowers to generate more energy  When you work in your areas of natural strength, you actually generate energy rather than deplete it. Structure your role and responsibilities to maximize time spent on your superpowers. This isn't just about productivity - it's a sustainable approach to high performance over the long term.

Featured guest perspectives

"If you subscribe to... this idea of managing your energy, not your time... this will help you do that. If you're using your superpowers, you will have more energy."

— Donna Lichaw
