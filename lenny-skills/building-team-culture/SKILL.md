Building Team Culture  Team culture is the invisible operating system that shapes how decisions get made when leadership isn't watching. Done well, it attracts the right talent, enables autonomous execution, and creates compounding returns as the team scales. Done poorly, it becomes a source of friction that slows everything down.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 138 experts.

1 Define values that actually filter, not just inspire  Your values should be sharp enough to exclude people, not generic enough that everyone nods along. Great cultures use values as a hiring filter and performance framework. If a value like 'ownership' doesn't have specific behaviors attached to it, it's meaningless. Consider whether your values would actually cause someone to self-select out.

Featured guest perspectives

"I rewrote the values designed to be a sharp knife to cut out the parts of the company that I just knew wouldn't be effective. So, I said that people must be resilient, that we had very high standards, that we'd work incredibly hard, that shareholder value was the most important thing that we'd optimize for."

— Eoghan McCabe    "Ownership defined in an individualistic culture is going to look very, very different than ownership defined in a collectivist culture... they're just like, 'Well, this is our culture. We're into ownership.' It's not saying much, saying that you believe in ownership without the addition of... the behaviors that represented that level of ownership."

— John Cutler    "Culture actually already exists. We have a culture. It's like whatever it is, and it's working pretty well... what I'm really trying to do is kind of describe the culture that's there. So it's not creating culture, it's articulating the culture, so we know what it is."

— Dharmesh Shah        2 Build trust through high talent density first  Freedom and responsibility only work when you have high-judgment people who can be trusted to make good decisions. You can't skip this step. Hire painfully slowly for the first ten people because they set the DNA for everyone who follows. Then use that talent density to reduce process rather than add it.

Featured guest perspectives

"We can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture, including candor, learning, seeking excellence in improvement, freedom and responsibility if you don't start with high talent density."

— Elizabeth Stone    "We had this mantra internally... 'Hire painfully slowly.'... We really focused on that first 10. That allows us to really have this sort of community of teammates that basically want to stick around... you want to be able to then replicate the next 10 and then replicate the next 10, but that first 10 needs to be all super cohesive."

— Grant Lee    "Internally we use the metaphor that Notion's a small bus. The bus, the smaller the bus, it's easier to turn corners, easier to accelerate, easier to maneuver... As a leader in the company, you decide who sit around you on the bus seats. That dictates how fast our overall bus moves."

— Ivan Zhao        3 Create psychological safety through radical transparency  High-performing teams operate in environments where information flows freely and people feel safe to speak truth to power. Share board decks, real-time metrics, and the 'why' behind decisions. When leaders model vulnerability and openness to feedback, teams reciprocate with trust and candor.

Featured guest perspectives

"We really have an approach of very radical transparency about everything... Instead of demoralizing people, I think that this is something that gives them a sense of deep partnership. We really want everyone's brains in the challenge, and not just one centralized brain and a lot of working hands."

— Daniel Lereya    "Creating this really open information ecosystem is one of the ways that we do that... anytime they have the wrong information, or they don't have the information, you've now blocked one of the economically most valuable things that your company possesses, which is this person's time, attention, talent."

— Boz    "A leader who is willing to be appropriately vulnerable is a stronger leader... it makes you not less influential as a leader."

— Carole Robin        4 Enforce culture through systems, not speeches  Culture isn't what you say in all-hands meetings. It's what gets measured, rewarded, and punished in daily operations. Treat culture as a product with feedback loops. Score people on values adherence, not just output. Create rituals that reinforce behaviors and make the implicit explicit.

Featured guest perspectives

"I designed these quarterly performance processes where not only would you get a mark or a grade for your performance against your goals that quarter, but you'd also get a score for your behavior against the values. And I hard coded a formula myself... if people got below a certain mark, respectfully and lovingly, we would say, thank you for your service."

— Eoghan McCabe    "Culture is a product, period, and that every company builds two products, one is the product they build for their customers, and the other is a product they build for their team. That's what culture is, it's the product you build for your team."

— Dharmesh Shah    "Culture at scale is the codification of what matters to a business and the ritualization of living those values. It starts with whoever the founders are and then it will emanate across as long as the founders are super consistent."

— Jonathan Lowenhar        5 Own your role in creating the culture you have  Leaders set the emotional tone for their organizations. Your nervous system state, your willingness to embrace feedback, your attention to detail all cascade through the team. Before blaming others, ask: 'How have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want?'

Featured guest perspectives

"The question that I often ask is how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want. The purpose of this question is actually to evoke your own agency... So if you want to create a high-functioning team, do your work, and it starts with the person who has the most power."

— Jerry Colonna    "There's also this idea of emotional contagion... the leader or the CEO has a disproportionate impact or their emotional state has a disproportionate impact on the people in their team. So something I'd like to say is the nervous system of an organization is a reflection of the nervous system of the CEO."

— Jonny Miller    "If you are managing a team and you want to sharpen the skills, make it a team goal, or have accountability and just say, 'Hey guys, I know that I've been pushing back on things lately. I want to really try to embrace and grow off of ideas better, hold me accountable, call me out.'"

— Adam Grenier

✗ Common Mistakes

Writing generic values that everyone agrees with but no one acts onHiring for culture 'fit' instead of culture 'add'Trying to preserve early-stage culture exactly as it was instead of letting it evolveSpreading high performers across teams to 'seed' culture rather than keeping teams intactUsing speeches and perks to build morale instead of creating tangible progress     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

New hires self-select out during the interview process because the culture is clearly definedTeam members give and receive direct feedback without HR escalationDecisions get made autonomously without waiting for leadership approvalCore team members stay for years, building deep institutional knowledgeProblems surface early in 1:1s rather than festering into crises

"We had a very, very good set of complimentary domains and skillsets, so we had really clear decision making rights... the ability to be really truth seeking and take the most respectful interpretation when you're giving feedback to focus on trying to get to a smart good outcome that benefits the business."  Tactical:  Establish clear decision-making rights based on complementary skill sets.Attack the problem, not the person, during constructive conflict.Schedule regular check-ins to explicitly discuss how the working relationship is affecting personal dynamics.

"You got to have your teams look like the world, it just makes you so much faster. It's not perfect... But it helps a lot. To your second point about diversity and how to foster it... When you recognize that you get business value from it, then it all of a sudden becomes something that you look out for and you take care of."  Tactical:  Recruit teams that reflect the global diversity of your user base to speed up decision-making.Focus on retention of diverse talent by creating an environment that rewards their unique cultural perspectives.

"OpenAI is truly, truly bottoms up... because we don't exactly know what capabilities will even come up soon and we don't know what's going to work technically... it's much more important for us to be very humble and learn a lot more empirically and just try things quickly. And the org is set up in that way to be incredibly bottoms up."  Tactical:  Hire for high individual drive and autonomy to support a bottoms-up structurePrioritize quick empirical learning over long-term roadmaps when technical capabilities are evolving rapidly

Alisa Cohn 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"They're trying now to be the leader who everyone loves, but what really needs to happen very often is, we need to drive towards results... High engagement workforce is great. I think what that comes from is winning culture, which means we're set up for success. We've got the structure for success, we have the culture for success, everyone understands their role, they know the impact of their role."  Tactical:  Prioritize driving results over being likedCodify culture around how work gets done (e.g., 'measure twice, cut once') rather than social ritualsEnsure every employee understands the impact of their specific role    "What are your values? And I think it's really essential to do some sort of values clarification exercise. You can find a ton of them online. You can find a list of values and just pull out your core values and just compare them with each other because when you are aligned, it's great."  Tactical:  Pick 20 values, winnow to 10, then narrow to a core 3-5Compare values with partners to identify potential conflicts (e.g., 'Excellence' vs. 'Work-life balance')Update values annually as the company or individuals evolve

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti + Kiriti Badam 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"You want to build a culture of empowerment, of augmenting AI into your own workflows so that you can 10X at what you're doing instead of saying that probably you'll be replaced if you don't adopt AI... You want to make your entire organization be in it together and make AI work for you instead of trying to guard their own jobs."  Tactical:  Position AI as a way for employees to 10x their productivity.Involve subject matter experts (SMEs) early to ensure they feel empowered to guide the AI's behavior.

Alex Komoroske 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"If you want to get your team to do great work, there's no shortcut other than to have an extremely high-trust environment where people lean into their superpowers in a way that adds up to something greater than some of its parts. That takes time. It takes effort. It's very difficult to make legible up to the rest of the organization, but that is where great things come from."  Tactical:  Identify and explicitly name the 'superpowers' of your team members to make them feel seen and valued.Provide 'cover fire' for the team by hitting standard goals so they have the safety to work on transformative, 'ugly baby' ideas.

Anuj Rathi 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"There are only three reasons why things do not happen the way you want them to happen as a leader. You can look at a person, and you would say either that person can't do, which is a capability issue, or they won't do, which is a motivation or an alignment issue, or they were not set up to do, which is really your problem that you didn't set up the ways of working now design properly."  Tactical:  Diagnose performance issues by asking if the person 'can't do,' 'won't do,' or was 'not set up to do.'Recognize that 70-80% of problems are often 'setup' issues related to org design or conflicting OKRs.

"We work from the office most of the time... I think it's pretty nice. Then you can say like, 'Hey, I think we're thinking wrong about this thing,' or, 'Shouldn't we actually do this other thing?' And especially I think lunch, eating lunch together is a pretty productive hour where you're cross pollinating."  Tactical:  Prioritize in-office work for high-bandwidth communicationUse shared meals as a productive time for cross-pollination of ideas

"I think when you are in a large organization, trying to do a actually new thing, I think small teams are better than big ones, period.

"I've learned that optimism is a renewable resource... his ability to generate energy and to use his optimism to renew everybody's dedication to the mission is unbelievable and I think it's such an important part of the culture."  Tactical:  Use optimism as a tool to renew dedication to the mission during challenging periodsFoster a 'growth mindset' where energy and clarity are prioritized    "when all of that happens, the org chart starts to become the work chart.

Barbra Gago 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I think really integrating the values can help with that and also, of course, make the brand itself human and authentic and something that people really feel emotional connection to. The best way to incorporate your brand and how people are interacting with people that you are selling to, customers or whoever, partners, is to have those values incorporated because then it's every touchpoint isn't something that you have to train people, okay, these are all the touch points and this is how the brand needs to manifest. It already will because it's part of the DNA of the company."  Tactical:  Integrate company values into the brand identity to ensure authenticityUse values to guide how employees interact with customers and partners    "What I have done in the past with values is we just did an exercise with my leadership team, for example, where we did a workshop format. We actually used Miro where everybody just brain dumped their ideas around values, and then it was, okay, from there, let's group them into themes. And then from there, let's vote on the most important things. And then from there, how do we start to articulate and define these things?"  Tactical:  Conduct a 'brain dump' session for value ideasGroup individual ideas into broader themesUse voting to prioritize the most important valuesAssign a single writer to draft the final definitions after the group work

"When creating the growth group, we resolved this by ensuring that each of the growth teams were truly cross-functional in nature with everyone in each team aligned around common objectives and KPIs. Every team has engineers, an engineering manager, a product manager, a designer, a growth marketer, decision science support."  Tactical:  Embed growth marketers directly into product teams to enable faster testingAlign all functions around common KPIs to reduce friction between R&D and Marketing

"Saying a company is design-led does not mean it's designer-led. I've never seen somebody graft it on after the fact. It's there at the beginning in the root DNA or doesn't exist."  Tactical:  When interviewing, look for a 'credible story' that tracks the value of your function back to the company's founding.    "I think the people falling off of these jobs is the common use case. That is the common story. We have a bias towards survivors and we all talk about how it looks like they made it to the top, but everybody that makes it to the top, there's hundreds of people that don't."  Tactical:  Recognize that failing in a specific role is often a cultural mismatch rather than a career-ending event.

Benjamin Lauzier 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"In the U.S. I think you have this inherently very liquid and dynamic market. I think... it leads to greater ownership and accountability for people and product at all levels... In France the market is much less liquid... PMs tend to have less autonomy and ownership, and a little bit more like micromanagement."  Tactical:  Recognize that rigid employment laws can make founders more 'cagey' and hands-on with their vision.In less liquid markets, invest more in 'proving yourself beforehand' rather than the 'hire and prove' model.    "Develop teams that revolve around this concept of ownership and accountability teams that are clearly owning a... slice of the business, not feature teams like shipping maybe guests, but teams that have clear accountability with consequences, but also clear ownership and leeway to do their best and to thrive."  Tactical:  Structure teams around business slices or metrics rather than functional features.Ensure teams have both the accountability for consequences and the leeway to make autonomous decisions.

Bob Moesta 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I should actually find my teammates that actually love to do the stuff I suck at or love the stuff that drains my energy. Because ultimately that's the diversity of a team that actually makes it really work. And so instead of trying to, most people try to hire people like themselves, and that actually is where it goes wrong because then you end up with a very large blind spot."  Tactical:  Map the energy drains of the current team and hire specifically to fill those gaps.Avoid 'hiring in your own image' to prevent collective blind spots in the team's capabilities.

Tactical:  Define leadership principles that are 'real' and actionableCreate specific organizational processes to reinforce cultural values

Brian Balfour 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"The thing that is actually moving the needle are the companies that are defining incredibly hard constraints... One company... set a benchmark that we will be one-fifth, each of our functions will be one-fifth the size. What that did is it created a constraint that you couldn't hire above that level, and it forced people to essentially find ways to adopt AI."  Tactical:  Implement hiring freezes or reduced headcount benchmarks to force AI adoption.Categorize employees into catalysts, converts, and anchors to manage the transition.Set a hard deadline for 'anchors' to adapt or exit to maintain cultural density.

"When you reflect the stress onto your teams, everybody tenses up and tightens up. And so it counterintuitively doesn't produce better outcomes. And so I think the other reality to remind ourselves... is you're never as good as you think you are. You're never as bad as you think you are."  Tactical:  Adopt an even-keeled demeanor to keep the team's head clear during crisesUse the mantra 'you're never as good or as bad as you think' to maintain perspective

"We don't really have managers, but everyone at Canva has a coach. They're constantly working with you to look at your skills, but also when it might be time to move on to the next level."  Tactical:  Assign coaches from the same specialty to help with craft-specific growthUse coaches to help identify when an employee is ready to move to the next level or pivot roles    "I think you can probably bring in the world's best person at X, Y, and Z, but if they're not fitting into your team and understanding your culture and have the same passion and vision that you do, they're not going to succeed. So it's super important that we have people along with us for the ride and that might mean everyone at Canva is awesome. They mightn't be the number one person in the world for that particular thing, but they get more done than the number one person could because they've built that trust and that safety with their team."  Tactical:  Prioritize cultural fit and shared passion over raw technical ranking during hiringEncourage new leaders to listen and understand existing culture for several months before implementing major changes    "We have a system we call coaching at Canva where you have a coach and they're constantly working with you to look at your skills, how you can improve each of those individual skills, but also what it is that you're actually doing and when it might be the time to move on to the next level."  Tactical:  Train internal specialists to act as coaches for their peersUse 360 feedback cycles to complement the coaching relationship

"Overwork kind of lets you just sidestep doing the hard work of figuring out what's important in the first place... I just think... people should challenge themselves to be focused and get the important stuff done and always be asking themselves what is important to do?"

Brian Chesky 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. They find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. That's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity. And what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly."  Tactical:  Prioritize clarity of direction over leadership compromiseEnsure the entire company is 'rowing in the same direction'

"Interpersonal competence is a determinant of both personal and professional success... people do business with people not ideas, not products, not machines."  Tactical:  Focus on 'referent power'—showing up in a way that makes others want to follow you as a person.Invest in building 'robust and functional' relationships as a baseline for team dynamics.    "A leader who is willing to be appropriately vulnerable is a stronger leader... it makes you not less influential as a leader."  Tactical:  Use the '15% rule': step just slightly outside your comfort zone when disclosing feelings or mistakes.Share the 'why' behind your emotions (e.g., 'I am worried because...') to inspire collective action.

"people do not value celebrations enough. I've had CEOs who said, "Well, it was the middle of the quarter, so we didn't start OKRs, but we did start Friday celebrations and oh my God, things are already changing. Things are already getting better.""  Tactical:  Implement Friday celebrations to share the 'most awesome' things that happened in each department.Focus on making people feel part of something special through public recognition of work.    "The first step is, get your shit together. They have strategy, they have empowered teams, they have psychological safety, and then the OKRs are that extra layer that supercharges them."  Tactical:  Ensure psychological safety exists before rolling out a rigorous OKR process.Treat OKRs as a 'vitamin' to supercharge existing strength rather than 'medicine' for a broken culture.

Tactical:  Use culture as a magnet for the right talentPrioritize in-person gatherings for remote teams to reinforce cultural cues    "I like to say culture add, because culture fit to me can actually be quite negative toward somebody who is the aberration... A culture add suggests that actually having some diversity on the team is helpful, because it actually adds to the culture."  Tactical:  Evaluate candidates based on what they add to the culture rather than how they fit existing norms    "The employee model is really simple. It's money or compensation at the base, recognition in the middle, and meaning at the top."

"At the start, my main focus was to get block to think like a technology company. And for a long time we had had a little bit of, I'm going to call it identity drift, maybe. We were talking about ourselves as a financial services company. Some people called us FinTech, all of this stuff. But when I started working at what was then known as Square, we were always thought of as a technology company just like Google or Facebook or any of the others."  Tactical:  Re-establish technology-focused rituals like company-wide hack weeksBring top individual contributors together to collaborate across the company    "We changed the organization. So all engineers report into one single team now, all designers report into one single team and there's single head of engineering, single head of design, et cetera. And so that was the big transformation that we made, and that meant we could really drive forward AI, we could drive forward platform and just technical depth generally."  Tactical:  Centralize engineering and design reporting lines to a single head of functionOptimize the organization for technical depth rather than independent business silos

"We had this thing where we all vote, but we vote offline in a document and we put a number in and then we put our comments in. And that way everyone has an equal voice in this document. And then when we talk about it, usually, of course the extroverts speak first, but everyone has a vote and we can actually see what people's point of views are."

"Product owners are central to the company and its growth. They are end-to-end responsible for the product, for this part of the business, and for their customers to be happy. And for that, they do really everything. They run the teams, they define which roadmap we need to build to improve certain business metrics, and they also contribute to high-level company strategy, but then most importantly, they execute on it relentlessly and they are ultimate responsible for the product to be shipped and achieve results."  Tactical:  Give product owners full responsibility for business metrics and customer happinessEnsure product owners are involved in both high-level strategy and relentless execution    "The way we operate, we have these fully cross-functional teams, meaning they're staffed with all necessary functions, engineers data, analysts, designers, operational managers and so on. And we also operate in metrics. So everyone has a line manager and a functional manager. So product owner is always the line manager for everyone on the team, meaning product owner defines what they need to do"  Tactical:  Staff teams with all necessary functions (eng, data, design, ops) under one product ownerUse a matrix structure where the PO defines the 'what' and functional managers define the 'how'

"culture actually already exists. We have a culture. It's like whatever it is, and it's working pretty well... what I'm really trying to do is kind of describe the culture that's there. So it's not creating culture, it's articulating the culture, so we know what it is"  Tactical:  Identify the attributes of the people who make others happy and successful within the company.Document culture in a 'Culture Code' that acts as an operating system for the company.    "culture is a product, period, and that every company builds two products, one is the product they build for their customers, and the other is a product they build for their team. That's what culture is, it's the product you build for your team."  Tactical:  Run quarterly NPS surveys to measure employee satisfaction with the 'culture product'.Treat negative feedback as 'culture bugs' and prioritize fixing them in all-hands meetings.Publish all survey responses transparently to the entire company.    "the job is to preserve the culture. That is not the job because the needs of your customers change, the needs of the employees change... just like you would never freeze the lines of code of a product, you would never freeze the lines of code of a culture. Culture should be iterated on"  Tactical:  Use 'liner notes' in culture documents to distinguish between current reality and future aspirations.

Tactical:  Offer voluntary severance packages during major strategy shifts to reset the teamReinforce the expected pace of operation clearly to all employees    "Make a Week is an example of that where like a week long company hackathon and the only prompt is, make Figma better in some way... many of our products and our most important features have come out of Make a Week setting, and the demos at the end are just so good."

"I used to work at a bunch of the big tech companies and I always felt that we could fire 90% of the people and we would move faster because the best people wouldn't have all these distractions. So when we start Surge, we wanted to build it completely differently with a super small, super elite team."  Tactical:  Prioritize hiring a 'super elite' few over scaling headcountFocus on removing organizational distractions to allow top talent to move faster    "I think one of the things that I didn't think about a couple years ago, but then someone said it to me, it's that companies in a sense are an embodiment of their CEO... when I think about certain big, hard decisions we have to make, I don't think what would the company do, I don't think what metrics are we trying to optimize, I just think, 'What do I personally care about? What are my values? And what do I want to see happen in the world?'"  Tactical:  Base hard company decisions on personal values rather than just generic business metricsRecognize that the CEO's personality and interests will inevitably shape the company's identity

"We actually wrote it to share with candidates. Because the idea was like, 'Look, we're kind of opinionated about how we do things here. Most companies struggle to describe what their culture is... our metric of success was that, more of the right people would apply to Stripe and fewer of the wrong people.'"  Tactical:  Write a 'quick start guide' to company culture for candidatesBe explicit about the trade-offs of your culture (e.g., working hard) to ensure alignment    "Micro pessimists, macro optimists. It was just this idea that, 'In the long term, we expect the curve to go up. We very much believe in the upward trajectory of just about everything. But on the day-to-day decisions, on the minutiae, we're quite critical.'"  Tactical:  Adopt a 'micro pessimist' mindset for day-to-day decisions to catch flawsMaintain 'macro optimism' to keep the team focused on long-term success    "Claire, who used to be the COO of Stripe, would always say, 'Are you willing to break the org for this person?'... some people are just that good that like, 'Yeah, of course you'll break the org for them.' They're going to break the org in the best way possible."  Tactical:  Identify high performers who are hindered by standard processesProvide 'air cover' and special treatment for exceptional talent when the ROI justifies the organizational cost

"We can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture, including candor, learning, seeking excellence in improvement, freedom and responsibility if you don't start with high talent density."  Tactical:  Prioritize talent density as the first step in building a high-performance cultureRecognize that freedom and responsibility cannot exist without high-judgment individuals    "In order to do that, you have to really hold yourself to a lot of stuff that doesn't feel like natural human behavior. What I mean by that is giving the feedback... being candid around your expectations when they're not being met... and be able to receive that type of feedback yourself in order to keep talent density high."  Tactical:  Practice an 'uncomfortable amount' of candor to maintain performance barsModel the behavior by being open to receiving tough feedback yourself    "I think the lack of process and prescriptiveness is all hinging on we've got amazing people who are smart, but even better have strong judgment."

"I rewrote the values designed to be a sharp knife to cut out the parts of the company that I just knew wouldn't be effective. So, I said that people must be resilient, that we had very high standards, that we'd work incredibly hard, that shareholder value was the most important thing that we'd optimize for."  Tactical:  Rewrite values to be 'sharp' and exclusionary rather than generic.Explicitly include traits like resilience, high standards, and hard work.    "I designed these quarterly performance processes where not only would you get a mark or a grade for your performance against your goals that quarter, but you'd also get a score for your behavior against the values. And I hard coded a formula myself, and so I took it out of the manager's hands to say, if people got below a certain mark, respectfully and lovingly, we would say, thank you for your service."  Tactical:  Score employees on behavior against values every quarter.Use a hard-coded formula to determine retention, reducing manager bias.

Tactical:  Prioritize hiring people who are intrinsically motivated by the work rather than titlesFoster an environment where people can stay for 5+ years to build deep institutional knowledge    "The reason for that is, one, that you can have high levels of trust with anyone you're talking to, because you know that they have a lot of context. It's not like this person's completely in the dark, in some corner of the company that doesn't... The second thing, everyone has agency to actually get stuff done, front to back."

"It's critical to ask what kind of experience am I? Not how good am I at my job, how much do I know, how critical am I to this process, but am I a miserable experience? If the answer is yes, don't worry too much about the other pieces yet. You got to fix that first."  Tactical:  Evaluate your own 'appeal'—how others experience working with you—before focusing on technical skills.Identify if you are a 'miserable experience' for colleagues and prioritize fixing that behavior.    "I think of companies and teams, almost like little terrariums that we're inside of... you want to actually create a habitat or an environment that's predisposed to high-functioning thinking and high-functioning interaction between people."  Tactical:  Audit the team environment to see if it rewards or discourages psychological safety and trust.Create a habitat where harming others is ineffective and merit-based influence is the norm.    "The biggest flaw in people's approach to culture... is to be performative... The other approach is to be deductive, logically deductive... Who is glad you exist? Why are they glad you exist?"  Tactical:  Define the team's 'role' by asking who would be sad if the team/company disappeared and why.Deduce cultural values and standards from the specific value the company provides to customers.

"We had this mantra internally... 'Hire painfully slowly.'... We really focused on that first 10. That allows us to really have this sort of community of teammates that basically want to stick around. I think Brian Chesky talks about this. Your goal is you get that first 10 and you want to be able to then replicate the next 10 and then replicate the next 10, but that 10 needs to be all super cohesive."  Tactical:  Avoid setting hiring targets based on headcount; focus on maintaining a high quality bar.Hire generalists who can wear multiple hats and move across domains.Adopt a 'player-coach' model for management where leaders still perform individual contributor work.

Tactical:  Create internal audio content to share the 'why' behind strategies and past mistakesUse interviews to make senior leadership more approachable to new hires    "If you put autonomy very far towards the leaves of the organization... there's a fair chance that you're just going to produce heat. You're going to have a hundred squads with a hundred strategies running in a hundred directions."  Tactical:  Place the primary 'autonomy level' at the VP level where seniority and pattern recognition existMove away from tiny 'full-stack' squads of seven toward larger teams (14+) to reduce management overhead

"I really like it when there's transparency in reorgs... We rolled these whiteboards out and it had the team structure with everyone's names on it. It had the name of the team, the mission of the team, how many open slots for hiring across all of these different teams, and then people's names in their existing team positions. People were invited to look, give feedback."  Tactical:  Visualize proposed team structures on whiteboards in public spacesInclude team missions and open hiring slots in the visualizationInvite employees to identify design mistakes or express interest in new roles    "One activity I do like to do with teams that merge is called story of our team... each team makes a timeline of... when they joined their team, when people left, and significant events and things they created that they're excited about and that they're proud of."  Tactical:  Have team members stand in order of when they joined to visualize tenureCreate a physical or digital timeline of team milestones and achievementsShare past learnings and proud moments to build a shared sense of history    "There's one team that was like, I guess they were delivering at this cadence that they loved... let's just spread the people from that team across the other ones and then we'll have that.

Tactical:  Hire people with diverse backgrounds, including former foundersSet a high bar with the first few hires to establish the long-term standard    "We did something we call culture interviews that I think the founders have written about or there's probably content online about this.

"I try to focus them less around how you litigate another person's impression of you and more on what is the action that you can take to counter program the narrative that you are afraid that this other person has of you.

Tactical:  Identify the specific negative narrative the employee is afraid of.Determine one small, immediate action that demonstrates the opposite of that fear.Challenge negative thinking by asking for evidence of the perceived slight.

I don't always do it, but I try to send my team just a quick rundown in Slack of, 'Here are the most important conversations or the most interesting conversations I had this week. Here's what that person said verbatim.' ... 'And here's what I interpret that as. Here's why I think they say that. Here's where I think that's coming from and here's what I'm going to do differently as a result.'"  Tactical:  Send a weekly Slack summary of high-level meetings.Include verbatim quotes from key stakeholders.Editorialize the context to explain the 'why' behind executive statements.    "I try to find ways that I really am impressed with my team, and the ways that they take care of themselves outside of work. Because I think people, bosses often inadvertently create reward loops for, 'Oh, this person, they had to stay up till two o'clock to get it done, but they got it done.' When you create those reward loops, that's the behavior that people start mimicking."  Tactical:  Publicly shout out team members for their outside-of-work achievements or hobbies.Avoid rewarding overwork or late-night heroics as the primary success metric.Model self-care by being visible about your own hobbies and downtime.

"The overhead is actually more from internal communication. It's really hard to get people's mind to be aligned on things, to see the world in the same way. And the part that you do need people, maybe you can solve better through systems, through better tools... we use the same mindset to build our company. And accidentally, that keep our headcount low, keep our company profitable."  Tactical:  Prioritize 'talent density' and revenue per employee over raw headcount growth.Use your own product as a 'meta-tool' to run the company and maintain alignment.    "Internally we use the metaphor that Notion's a small bus. The bus, the smaller the bus, it's easier to turn corners, easier to accelerate, easier to maneuver. The bigger the bus it is, bigger the boat or bigger the bus, slow down. And as a leader in the company, you decide who sit around you on the bus seats. That dictates how fast our overall bus moves."  Tactical:  Carefully select 'seat mates' (hires) who maintain the team's speed and agility.Communicate the value of a small team to employees to align them on staying lean.    "Internally, our company philosophy called crafts and values. Craft is your skill set, your taste. Value is your personal value and how do you see the world. Craft is interesting word. It's like about apply your value to some technical know-how and to make more clever trade-offs to create something new and useful and just keep doing that."

Tactical:  Stay in the details of the product to maintain accountability and quality.Model humility by being willing to perform any task, regardless of seniority.

Tactical:  Ask yourself: 'How have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want?'Focus on evoking your own agency rather than blaming external factors.    "Imagine sitting in a circle of people who just have your back, who really care about you as a person. And imagine then discussing some of the answers to those questions... Imagine sitting in a group of people who can just hold that space without fixing you, without telling you what you're doing right or wrong?"  Tactical:  Create spaces for 'shared experiences' where people can tell the truth about their challenges.Practice 'holding space' for others without immediately trying to fix their problems.

And if that means that you're going to pick up the phone and call customers, then that is what you're going to do to roll up your sleeves."

"The first thing you notice is the companies that are very high performing have coherence between the structure of their company and their current strategy. This is a structural thing... Their funding approach, their incentives, the org structure, the architecture, even their technical architecture supports their strategy back and forth."  Tactical:  Audit whether your team's incentives and organizational structure actually support your current strategic goals.    "Ownership defined in an individualistic culture is going to look very, very different than ownership defined in a collectivist culture. What I find with companies is that... they're just like, 'Well, this is our culture. We're into ownership.' It's not saying much, saying that you believe in ownership without the addition of... the behaviors that represented that level of ownership."

And so it's really just about becoming more aware and then taking responsibility for the influence that I have."  Tactical:  Question inherited belief systems that may cause conflictTake responsibility for your personal influence regardless of your formal title    "To me there's wisdom in emotion and I can start to access noticing them more. Like where do I feel sadness in the body? I notice I feel fear in the kind of center of my chest, and then sadness is like a sinking feeling in my stomach.

"I showed up to a team offsite with a spool of rope and sticky notes... each note of the graph was an engineer and the rope was the edges of the graph to connect them. And then we worked through the new algorithm extremely slowly, step by step. And it was a way that you couldn't leave that exercise without knowing exactly what was going on because everyone had a role to play."  Tactical:  Use physical metaphors (like rope for data graphs) to explain complex technical concepts during offsites.Ensure the entire team 'goes along for the journey' on major technical shifts to avoid knowledge silos.

"In retrospect, as hard as that was, I'm very grateful and very amazed that they could come together and share that with me. It can be hard to bring feedback forward like that. So it was an extremely valuable learning experience. I took from that to then immediately shift how I was operating. And really a key part in building trust was to listen, to hear out what the individuals on the team were setting out to do, what they cared about, what motivated them."  Tactical:  Prioritize listening over 'coming in swinging' when joining a new teamFocus on earning trust before inflicting change    "It's like, well, what T-shirt do you wear? What team are you on?' And I was like, 'You have two T-shirts. You have the Design T-shirt and you have the Marketplace T-shirt, or whatever cross-disciplinary team that you work on. Because both are really important communities to build for slightly different reasons.'"  Tactical:  Create dedicated moments for functional communities to gather even when embedded in cross-functional teams    "Our operating principles include meticulous craft. It is one of the things that is really important to us as an organization is just having that meticulous care for all that you do, whether it's you're designing the space that we work within or that you're creating the API or that you're building the interface or that you're talking to people on support calls, the meticulous craft is something that is actually expected of everybody."  Tactical:  Embed craft into the company's core operating principlesApply the standard of craft to non-visual outputs like APIs and support calls    "Performance equals potential minus interference. And I really like this, it's pretty simple, but it's a good reminder that, as a leader, one of the things that you are of course driving towards is trying to get better performance so that your team feels more purpose and motivation and is excited about their work... the key pieces of that, of course, is potential, so thinking about how you increase potential, which would be, of course, hiring really well, developing the talent... And then paired to that though of course is decreasing the interferences, which could be that lead weight on top of great talent."  Tactical:  Identify 'interferences' like poor processes or misalignment that act as a lead weight on talentRegularly redesign team processes as the organization scales to prevent 'atrophy'

"We wanted to change the lack of ambition, the lack of creativity, the lack of customers feeling that the product had changed at all."  Tactical:  Identify and challenge 'sacred cows' that prevent product evolution.    "The sacred cows are like their own roadmap. What are all the things that you think we're not allowed to change? Let's start there."  Tactical:  List all organizational 'sacred cows' and treat them as a potential roadmap for innovation.    "I think one of the really important things about driving cultural change at the leadership level is you've got to identify whether someone's on the wagon or off the wagon and either quickly convince them to get on the wagon or if they're not on the wagon, they shouldn't be there."  Tactical:  Assess team members' alignment with the new vision early and move quickly on those who are 'off the wagon'.    "You need to staff projects with the team of people that are well equipped from a skillset standpoint, but more importantly have an obsession with the idea they want to pursue."

Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter 2 quotes      "One of the things that Elon did when he bought the company was he basically asked people to self-select to stay... I think that was really important for the company because you want people to opt into that. You want the people to be saying, 'Yeah, that's what I want to do,' and the company's going to be a lot more successful."  Tactical:  Create 'fork in the road' moments where employees must explicitly choose to commit to a new direction or cultureBe transparent about the intensity and expectations of the work to ensure natural alignment    "I've been amazed with just how much the team is able to accomplish with a small group and I think because of a small group...

"Since we are a fully remote and distributed company... we decided, 'Maybe we do something like that,' where basically, we would just pick a recipe...

"The most obvious kind of cliched one is culture. It is bread and butter to everything you do, from the people you hire to how you build the right mindset to just keeping the energy. I mean, energy at Airbnb was the currency."  Tactical:  Focus on hiring people who contribute to the team's energy.Use storytelling to keep the team's energy high even for small features.    "For example, we make sure that we take time to have personal and professional check-ins.

Because those personal connections, I mean, again, it's your second family, you're waking up every day to spend time with them."  Tactical:  Implement regular personal and professional check-ins.Encourage cross-functional team members to learn about each other's personal lives.    "I really, really do believe the power of branding the mundane is so successful. I mean, we brand, to be fair, I actually feel like that this was a page out of the Airbnb book... how much better is Air Dive than a customer service analysis? So much better. So I think a lot of learnings on just the power of branding and storytelling your workflows and your frameworks and what it means to do your job, often keeps people motivated, too."  Tactical:  Give creative names to internal programs (e.g., 'Air Dives' instead of 'Customer Service Analysis').Brand Slack channels and project names to create better memory recall and motivation.

"The only way to escape the trap of experimenting everything is to have a very intentional culture about doing right by customers and doing the right thing for the business... there shouldn't be, especially in engineering within the world of growth, a culture around having to point to numbers to demonstrate your impact because if there is, then the team will biased experiments all the time, and that's not necessarily the right thing for the business."  Tactical:  Reward impact measured by qualitative feedback and business outcomes like closed dealsEnsure performance reviews don't rely exclusively on experiment-driven metric liftsFoster a results-oriented culture that prioritizes urgency and customer value

"During my startup, when we were going through that, in order to motivate the team, one of the best tricks that I came up with, and I learned this from a bunch of other people also, is you just give a team a win. Winning really, really drives a lot of energy. We had a choice to make between launching something which will take six months, versus launching something that we can launch in a very small-ish kind of way, but launch it in a month. And we chose the latter, because when we did that, I remember people were giving high five to each other, people were saying, 'Hey, you know what? This is great. We put something in front of customers.'"  Tactical:  Choose smaller, faster ship cycles (e.g., one month vs. six months) during low-energy periods to build confidence.Focus on getting features in front of even a small number of customers to reinforce the team's identity as builders.

"It is really important to me that we feel that we've deliberately understaffed every project at the company. If you overstaff, you get politics, you get people working on things that are further down the priority list than necessary. That is poison. It's wasteful. It slows you down. It creates cruft."  Tactical:  Understaff projects by default to maintain urgency and focus.Avoid overstaffing to prevent work on low-priority or ambiguous tasks.    "If you want to be in the 99th percentile in terms of outcomes, it's going to be really difficult. You got to sort of remind people that if they ever find themselves in the comfort zone at work, they are definitely making a mistake. It's supposed to be really fricking exhausting."  Tactical:  Remind the team that extraordinary results require extraordinary effort.Identify and push back when the team settles into a 'comfort zone'.    "Teams will always optimize for local comfort over company outcomes. The purest form of ambition and most intense source of energy in the business is the founder CEO. Every next concentric circle of management beyond the founder CEO has the potential to be an order of magnitude drop off in intensity. That is fucking dangerous."  Tactical:  Mirror the founder's intensity rather than buffering the team from it.Inject energy into the system to fight organizational entropy and decay.

We have default optimism because we are in a new space, so if someone's going to come into Deel and they're going to be pessimistic... they're going to just slow things down."

"One of the best things, honestly, that the early founding team at Slack did and were able to give to those of us who followed them was the understanding that this is a tool for work. And that made thousands of small decisions instant and obvious."  Tactical:  Establish a foundational product identity to guide feature prioritization and cultural norms.    "It's one thing to have a team of all white men, but if you have two African American people in your first 20 people, you could have a lot more diversity and not even amongst just that one group. Women want to work with other women, but men of all races I think look at an organization, but let's say it's all white people, but there's a few women, they may look at it as just a more diverse, more friendly place and be less intimidated to be, for instance, the first person of color who works there."  Tactical:  Prioritize diversity in the first 20 hires to lower the barrier for future diverse candidates.Actively source diverse candidates rather than relying on passive inbound pipelines.

"Thiel thinks that a lot of the best recruiters in the world or the companies that attract talent, they put out this distinctive bad signal and it has to turn some people off.

"Titles are not going to be this memetic totem that everybody competes for. Instead, everyone is just going to have the same slightly meaningless title... I think they wanted to avoid this intel competition. There are downsides to doing this... but I think what it did do is that it basically said if you are in... a role of you're leading a very important project... it's a meritocratic thing."

Tactical:  Update performance reviews to include 'AI agency and fluency' as a core expectationCelebrate and highlight 'wins' from early AI adopters in company all-handsCreate 'pods' to pilot new ways of working before rolling them out company-wide

"When we launched the [email protected] was an alias for [email protected]. So if you sent a customer service request to Pandora, every single person in the company received it. And because we made a decision to have no customer support team in the first year, the expectation was that whoever sees the request first should respond to it."  Tactical:  Route customer feedback to a shared alias accessible by all employeesEncourage unscripted, human-to-human communication with users instead of using macros    "I just wasn't interested in performative contribution, that it's the work that matters and what I want to celebrate is if you can show up and do it and go home and have other things in your life, because I think that's a recipe for being able to do it on a sustained basis rather than burning yourself out."  Tactical:  Reward efficiency and results rather than time spent at the deskModel healthy boundaries to prevent team burnout

Tim Holley 2 quotes

"We had had a pretty entrenched consensus-based culture, where we would really debate a lot of decisions and a lot of features... On the other hand, not fast. When you have your identity tied up in the company and what you do, and then you're kind of being asked or you realize that you need to change how you're working, it can feel pretty existential."  Tactical:  Identify where consensus is slowing down decision-making.Acknowledge the emotional difficulty of cultural shifts when employee identity is tied to the old way of working.    "We call them guiding principles at Etsy... one of them is around digging deeper, and that really speaks to aiming to really understand the why behind a change... Another example of a principle is minimizing waste. It aligns with how we think about product development, which is, we want to know, is the work we're doing adding value to the customer and the business?"  Tactical:  Establish principles that encourage understanding the 'why' behind every change.Use a 'minimizing waste' principle to empower teams to stop work that isn't adding value.

"During crisis, people will appreciate more than anything else transparency. And if you hide information from them, then they would leave, they don't trust you anymore. But if there is a crisis, and look, if there is a crisis then everyone knows that there is a crisis, it's not surprising for anyone. And this is where they expect your leadership the most."  Tactical:  Share the 'essence' of the crisis with the team, including specific failures like rejected term sheets.Display key metrics publicly (e.g., in the office lobby) so the team can see the reality of the situation in real-time.

"The first one is having a can-do attitude... we've always set these ridiculously ambitious goals, and then somehow the trajectory of the company forms around those goals. ... The second thing is really high standards... The third one that we really lean on significantly is intensity."  Tactical:  Set 'ridiculously ambitious' goals to force the company's trajectory upwardMaintain an output-oriented culture rather than focusing on input metrics like hours    "We focus much more on how we can leverage people's strengths rather than helping to improve weaknesses, because there's some things that I'm not great at and I'll never be the best in the world at, and there's others that I can hopefully refine and strive to be."  Tactical:  Identify the specific areas where a team member has the potential to be the best in the worldAssign roles and tasks that align with existing strengths

Garrett Lord 2 quotes

"We were also way more upfront around this is going to be chaotic. Just owning that narrative in front of all hands at the core company, owning it directly with the team. We have a separate all hands, we have separate onboarding, we have a separate recruiting team."  Tactical:  Own the narrative of chaos during all-hands meetings to set expectationsCreate separate onboarding and recruiting processes for high-growth sub-teams    "We have this motto to leave nothing to chance. For a while there we drew the number of days in the year on the whiteboard and it was like, there will never be a time like this... How do you make sure that three months from now, six months, you have no regrets? Get on the plane to go talk to a customer, make the late night push, check the data six times over again."  Tactical:  Visually track time (e.g., days remaining in the year) to maintain urgencyEncourage 'over-checking' data and direct customer interaction to eliminate regrets

"I do not believe in being liked. I believe in being loved, right? And that's a very, very different thing... love is the choice to extend yourself for the spiritual growth of oneself or another... when you are extending yourself, you're not nice. It's not always nice or like, it sometimes is having hard conversations."  Tactical:  Define team values intentionally (e.g., 'Freedom and Responsibility' or 'Informed Captain')Encourage 'principled confrontation' and 'toe-stepping' if it serves the business

"The other place to start that's less common, but I also think it happening in reality, is maybe they will start a cross-functional, almost like a tiger team. Because if the initial focus area is, let's say, they want to do a product qualified lead... That involves not only product team, that will involve data team... You also need to bring sales team in."  Tactical:  Form a temporary tiger team to build conviction before committing to a permanent growth orgEnsure representation from product, data, and sales in the initial growth squad

"Not everyone can look stupid in public over and over, but I believe it's my superpower and I try to make it my whole team's superpower too. ... My goal there is not to annoy the person, but it's to understand the content."  Tactical:  Publicly ask basic questions in meetings with senior leaders to encourage others to do the sameScreenshot and share instances where you were corrected or didn't understand something to normalize learning

"We want people that show up to our company with some fire in their belly, something that they are out to do... heartfelt intensity. And I think even relative to everything else, I'm going to say, that's it. If you have a team that has heartfelt intensity and is there for a purpose and something to prove, you give them a very exciting, ambitious product and get out of their way and they will do remarkable work."  Tactical:  Hire for intrinsic motivation and a 'point to prove'Give ambitious prompts and then remove management friction    "instead of having a corporate landing page with five value titles and subtitles, let's write a manual for how to take a road trip. So we wrote an essay called 'Notes on Road Trips' that use this semi-biographical, but mostly fictional, story about a person and their father taking a road trip when they're a teenager, to tell the story of how we do things at The Browser Company."  Tactical:  Interview the entire team to find the organic patterns of how they already workUse a metaphor (like a road trip) to frame the company's operating manual    "whenever we ship something, we go out of our way to celebrate the people that worked on it publicly. I think there's a CEO-hero worship sometimes in Silicon Valley... I do very little as it relates to the thing people fall in love with Arc... we go out of our way to celebrate the people that worked on it publicly."  Tactical:  Tag specific designers or engineers in public launch announcementsTreat the hiring of a new team member as a 'product launch' and celebrate it publicly

"One thing I've learned is it's super hard to scale culture, especially when you're growing as fast as DoorDash has since I joined... one thing that scales really well is written work."  Tactical:  Create a 'How to work with me' document to codify expectations and personal traitsBe transparent about your own weaknesses and areas for growth in team-wide documents    "We have a program called WeDash, where, four times, a year all employees are required to go do deliveries."  Tactical:  Implement a mandatory 'dogfooding' program where employees perform the core service of the businessCreate a dedicated channel (like Slack) for employees to report bugs found during these experiences

"We divided the team into these smaller groups for peer feedback groups and the idea is that they meet every two weeks or so, somebody brings something that's in a pretty rough draft that they want to get reviewed and then everyone's expected to give feedback."  Tactical:  Divide large product teams into smaller peer feedback cohortsMeet every two weeks to review work in its 'rough draft' stageInclude different leadership levels to model constructive feedback behavior

"The most precious person in an organization is the disagreeable giver. Those are the people who are really motivated to do what's best for the company, but they can be a little bit disagreeable in the sense that they may not say what you want to hear. They may push back on things, they may fight for things."  Tactical:  Identify and protect 'disagreeable givers' who challenge the status quo for the right reasonsAvoid 'agreeable takers' who are likable but self-interested

"The teams that I've helped build are... a team of Avengers that are just very different, have very different superpowers, but together you as the leader are the one who's helping adjudicate any differences or any disagreements but you know you're getting the best outcome when everyone's pulling and obsessing over a different thing."  Tactical:  Hire people who spike in different areas to create a balanced 'super team'Encourage healthy debate between different functions (e.g., growth vs. design)    "I spent probably as much time, if not more time on recruiting and building the team as I did thinking about the product... you got to bring the right people together to have a huge impact. It's the best investment you can make."  Tactical:  Allocate as much time to recruiting and team building as to product strategyPartner deeply with recruiters to define the necessary 'spikes' for the team

"We had to get people from feature obsession, revenue obsession, to belief obsession. What is belief obsession? When we all believe that when coronavirus is over, people will want to travel. We all believe that coronavirus will be over. You start going into first principles belief-based thinking, and you'll bring stories that will make people believe that the future that we are working toward is actually possible."  Tactical:  Use first-principles thinking to remind the team why the product's mission mattersEnsure founders are visible and on the front lines to maintain trust

Tobi Lutke 1 quote

"Every product in the world, the quality at the end of the day is simply a reflection of how much the people who created it gave a shit about the product. And it is not possible to make great products if the people work on it do not give a shit about the product. And I actually think this is a very important role for product leaders to make sure that the team gives a shit."  Tactical:  Build empathy for the users within the team to increase how much they careBe 'exothermically infectious' about the product's importance as a leaderAvoid working on products you don't personally care about, as you cannot produce greatness without it

Varun Parmar 2 quotes

"The first one is practicing empathy to gain insights. It's not just practicing empathy in terms of customers... but given our distributed nature... we have to make sure that we actually practice that internally."  Tactical:  Ask questions during reviews to understand the insights and constraints that led a team to their specific prioritization decisions.Assume good intention and seek to understand the 'why' behind a colleague's recommendation.    "We have something called as Miro Connect, which happens every other Friday... you've got a bunch of product teams sitting around tables... and you're going from table to table and you have teams that are actually showing all the amazing work... it's magical in terms of the outcomes that you can get."  Tactical:  Host bi-monthly, low-pressure demo sessions where teams can show work-in-progress to the broader company.Encourage engineers and designers to wander between 'booths' to find cross-pollination opportunities.

Will Larson 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I think that we often treat engineers a little bit like children instead of giving them the responsibilities and ability to actually thrive as adults. And so like, 'Oh, the engineers won't want to do that work.' Well, that's actually not good for the engineers to be sheltered from what is important. And so actually one of the, I think, highlights is that I think we're coming back this moment where we can actually treat engineers like our peers and put them into really senior leadership roles and not have this kind of baseline assumption of like, 'Oh, we have to coddle them or hide them from the real problems.'"  Tactical:  Stop 'coddling' engineers and instead give them the responsibility to solve important business problemsHold engineers accountable for outcomes to enable them to grow into senior leadership roles    "I think of these as identity values. These are really just you describing who you want to be... Is it honest? Is it applicable? And can you reverse it? And if not, it's probably actually not helping the team make decisions."  Tactical:  Test values for reversibility—if no one would ever choose the opposite, the value is likely a generic 'identity' valueEnsure values are applicable to specific trade-offs (e.g., 'optimize globally' vs. 'optimize for your team')
