Conducting Interviews  Interviewing is a skill that must be learned and practiced. It doesn't come naturally. The goal is to move beyond gut feelings to structured evaluation that surfaces a candidate's true capabilities, self-awareness, and fit for your specific context.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 75 experts.

1 Build a structured rubric before meeting candidates  Define the specific traits you're looking for before you start interviewing. Turn vague notions like 'culture fit' into explicit criteria. This prevents post-hoc rationalization and ensures consistent evaluation across candidates.

Featured guest perspectives

"Can you explain to me what that means? In the abstract, what are the things that you're looking for in someone that you want to fill that role? And we can then excavate that, right? And make what is implicit... let's make that explicit. So we can make that explicit, we can turn it into a decision rubric."

— Annie Duke    "We created a set of objective criteria that would be used and an interview methodology that would be used in every interview, which was the objective criteria would be our leadership principles, and the methodology would be behavioral based interviewing."

— Bill Carr        2 Go deep on one accomplishment rather than surface on many  Ask candidates about their most significant professional accomplishment and spend the entire interview probing that single example. Use the STAR method to understand the Situation, Task, Actions, and Results. Depth reveals more than breadth.

Featured guest perspectives

"I have to always clarify this, by this I mean not some award you won or some promotion you got, I mean something you built, or some product, some process, some organization you built... I could basically then, once they get into that example, ask a lot of probing and follow-up questions and I could fill an entire hour interview just sticking with this one example."

— Bill Carr        3 Ask about failures, not just successes  How a candidate talks about their failures reveals their self-awareness, honesty, and ability to learn. Look for raw, specific details about what went wrong and what they did differently afterward. Polished non-answers are a red flag.

Featured guest perspectives

"Talk me through your biggest product flop. What happened and what did you do about it?... I think the rawer the answer in terms of how bad it was and why, the better."

— Annie Pearl        4 Evaluate how they prepared, not just how they perform  Ask candidates how they prepared for the interview. Their answer reveals their planning process, seriousness, and research depth. Great candidates will have studied your product, talked to customers, and come with specific questions.

Featured guest perspectives

"I like to ask people how they prepared for the interview... I love the question because when you ask, hey, how did you prepare? You're really asking how does the person think? How did they plan? How did they take things seriously or not? What did they read? What did they do?"

— Austin Hay        5 Use live problem-solving to see how they think  Give candidates an unconventional problem to solve in real-time rather than relying solely on past examples. This reveals their intellectual curiosity, how they handle ambiguity, and whether they instinctively ask clarifying questions and consider cross-functional collaboration.

Featured guest perspectives

"I always give them a problem to solve. That is probably my favorite question... 'Hey Lenny, I have a friend. He's been legally deaf or hearing impaired his whole life, and he just got a new job that requires him to wake up significantly earlier than he normally does...' Walk me through how you go about tackling this."

— Christian Idiodi        6 Always end with 'Is there anything else?'  The most important information often surfaces when the formal structure ends. Give candidates a final opportunity to share something they haven't had a chance to mention. This question consistently reveals critical information that wouldn't otherwise emerge.

Featured guest perspectives

"Before we wrap, is there anything else? ... the interesting thing about that question, you can spend three hours with somebody... And at the very end you say, 'Hey, Susan, before we wrap, is there anything else?' And often, Lenny, the most important thing for that person to communicate comes out then."

— Christopher Lochhead

✗ Common Mistakes

Assuming interviewing is a natural skill rather than something that requires trainingUsing educational pedigree or resume gaps as shortcuts for evaluationDoing all the talking instead of letting the candidate reveal themselvesEvaluating based on gut feeling before completing structured assessment     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Your team has calibrated interview scorecards across multiple interviewersCandidates comment that your interview process was rigorous but fairNew hires consistently perform as expected based on interview assessments

"I like to ask people how they prepared for the interview. This is not, I can't take credit for this. My wife told me about, gave me this idea and I loved it. I think it was a16z partner. But I love the question because when you ask, hey, how did you prepare? You're really asking how does the person think? How did they plan? How did they take things seriously or not? What did they read? What did they do?"  Tactical:  Ask candidates 'How did you prepare for this interview?' to see their research and planning depth.Look for complex, interesting answers that indicate a high-level thinker.    "Tell me about the most difficult or challenging thing you've overcome in the last year in your life. It doesn't have to be work related, it could be personal. And I think it's a great way to just reset the atmosphere, make people dig a little bit deeper into who they are and be more vulnerable."  Tactical:  Ask about personal or professional challenges from the last year to gauge resilience.Use vulnerability to build a deeper connection and calm the candidate's nerves.

"I like asking what someone's top 10 accomplishments are. They hate it because it's like, 'Oh, God. Ugh.' But it's really interesting to understand the level of quantitative versus qualitative in their accomplishments, what they value. And also if it's a, 'Oh, I ran a hundred miles or I have a great family,' whatever it is, it's really interesting to get to know somebody and also what they value."  Tactical:  Ask candidates to list their top 10 accomplishmentsEvaluate the mix of quantitative and qualitative achievementsLook for personal values reflected in their chosen accomplishments

"I think interviewing is not a skill that comes naturally. People think it does. It does not... I really recommend... and my book has examples of rubrics, questions you can use. How do you really get at... Because it's hard to really evaluate someone in 30 minutes or 45 minutes."

Deb Liu 1 quote

"Show your passion around the product itself, around the use case, around the customer. Show who you are and why you care. I think sometimes people just say, 'I want a product job.' But you have to be able to fall in love with the problem. You have to fall in love, not with the product, but I said the problem, right? The use case. What problem are you trying to solve? And if you can do that, you can be a great product manager even without a lot of experience."

"Why do you want to work here is what I really like to ask because it tells me a lot...

Tactical:  Ask 'Why do you want to work here?' to gauge research depth and mission connection.    "What are you world-class at and how do you know that you're at that?

It has to be more than like, 'Oh, because my boss loves me,' or 'Because my mom told me,'... I want to hear, 'I'm proud of having accomplished this.' And maybe if you have some numbers to show, that's also really important."  Tactical:  Ask candidates what they are world-class at and require specific evidence or metrics to back it up.

"What is the most innovative thing you have done and why do you think it's innovative?

Jackie Bavaro 4 quotes

Listen to episode →

"And immediately I noticed there was this real difference in how people would answer the questions. And some people didn't seem to understand what the question was trying to get at. And some people sounded really good because they'd say, 'Well, I'll tell you three things. Number one, number two, number three.' And then when I paid attention to my notes, I'd be like, 'Wait, their three ideas weren't actually good ideas. They just sounded like they knew what they were doing.'"  Tactical:  Pay close attention to the substance of 'numbered' lists in answersDistinguish between confident delivery and high-quality product thinking    "That's how I feel about this interviewing. Is that the reason that some people don't do as well as they could on interviews is just because a lot of these interview questions are trick questions. When they say, 'Oh, how would you design a bathroom?' I used to think that meant, 'What do you want in a bathroom?' And that's not what it means at all. It means 'Who is the best customer for a bathroom? What would they want?' But if you haven't been trained in this, you wouldn't know."  Tactical:  Start design questions by identifying the target customerFocus on user needs rather than personal feature requests    "I love to ask, 'Tell me about a recent project that you're proud of.' I feel like a lot of interviews don't give people enough chance to shine, to talk about something that they did really, really well and hear about what made it so good and what are they proud of, and how did they achieve those amazing results."  Tactical:  Ask candidates to discuss projects they are genuinely proud ofLook for the 'why' behind their pride to understand their values    "I have a framework for this. The pearl framework for answering questions like this is problem, epiphany, action, result and learning. It's a little bit like the star framework, but I want it all like, 'What's the problem that you thought was worth solving, a problem that I think is big enough? What's your epiphany? What's the insight that you had? Do you notice something that nobody else did and how valuable was it?'"  Tactical:  Highlight the unique insight or 'epiphany' that drove the projectEnsure every story concludes with a specific growth or learning point

Jason Feifer 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"My favorite strategy for interviewing people is to throw a theory at them... I'll make a connection in my head and I'll say, 'I want to run a theory by you. Do you think that the reason why you are really interested in this or you made that decision is actually because of this other thing that you told me a little bit about?'... It forces people to think in real time in front of you."  Tactical:  Practice active listening to connect disparate points made by the interviewee into a cohesive theory.Ask the 'thing they haven't been asked' to break through the polish of experienced speakers.

"What do you want to do your first 30 days? ... In B2B, if I don't hear from the VP of sales or the VP of product that I'm going to go meet customers, out, I'm out."  Tactical:  Ask candidates what they plan to do in their first two weeksFilter for candidates who prioritize joining customer calls immediately    "Give them time. And I don't like to judge too harshly, but whether it's the first interview or the second, they got to sell you this pen. But it's not 'Sell me this pen,' it's 'Sell me this app.'"  Tactical:  Have candidates perform a demo of your actual productCheck if they have watched your explainer videos or webinars beforehand

"I would be in charge of the stopwatch that would time us. And I'd say, 'Okay, our time's up.' ... I would observe. Paul, Robert and Trevor, my co-founders would be asking them all sorts of questions about their product and their technology... I would usually remain pretty silent. And so I don't think people even really noticed me. But I would be just watching them and sort of trying to observe as much as I could"  Tactical:  Assign one interviewer to focus solely on observing dynamics and non-verbal cuesUse a strict timer to keep interviews focused and efficient    "The 10 minutes is kind of as long as you need, in most cases. Because we found when they were longer, like 20 minutes, you'd know in 10 minutes and be twiddling your thumbs trying to get through the interview for the next 10 minutes. So we kept them short so we could interview more people."  Tactical:  Keep initial screening interviews to 10 minutes to maximize volume and maintain focus

"One of the things that Elon Musk has said that I found it very valuable in my time, is that if you really want to interview somebody and they claim that they've done something, you ask them six levels down. You improved sales. How did you do that, exactly? Well, we improved the pipeline. How'd you do that, exactly? Oh, well, we made the pipeline more measurable by having things that could be. How did you know? What were the seven stages of the pipeline and what made you pick them? You go six levels down and you can really understand if somebody was the person who solved the problem or if they're the person who is claiming that they solved the problem."  Tactical:  Ask 'How did you do that exactly?' repeatedly to reach six levels of depth in a candidate's explanation.

Tactical:  Ask behavioral questions focused on past ambiguous situationsLook for candidates who seek input and iterate on their pathEvaluate the candidate's ability to create a structured way forward

Listen to episode →

"We think that there is a culture interview, there is a functional interview, and there is a technical interview, but they're designed to get at these notions of have they actually done this kind of work before? Have they been pulled or pushed in their career and are they your kind of human?"  Tactical:  Use the culture interview to ensure the candidate represents the company's core values.Use functional and technical interviews to verify they have successfully performed the required work previously.    "Just to ask the simple question even in the cover letter, of your last ex-bosses, how many would get on the phone and say, you're amazing? If there's any equivocation in the answer, great, move on."  Tactical:  Ask candidates early in the process how many former bosses would give them a glowing reference.Filter out candidates who hesitate or provide equivocal answers regarding past manager feedback.

"I often think ask people that... Ask about their projects and I try to go deeper. It's like why was this decision made? Why do you think the decision was made? And I might ask, 'Do you think it was the right decision or did you agree on it?'"  Tactical:  Ask candidates to critique decisions made at their previous companies to test for independent judgment.Look for candidates who can articulate the rationale behind their work beyond just 'I was told to build it.'

"I like to ask a hypothetical second order thinking question. For example, if everybody who has taken a COVID vaccine dies tonight, what happens in 12 months from now? Can you explain the world- from what happens to money, what happens to law? What happens to countries? What happens to the military? What happens to the stock market? What happens to the order of things?"  Tactical:  Ask 'what if' questions about absurd or extreme scenarios to test second-order thinking.Evaluate the range of domains the candidate considers (e.g., law, finance, social order) in their response.Look for the ability to judge the 'butterfly effect' of an event.

"interviews, actually we know, don't predict job performance. So, very little to no evidence would say interviews will predict how I perform on the job... We use skill assessments and trials as ways to predict job performance, but interviews are good at predicting affinity and culture fit."  Tactical:  Use skill assessments and trials for performance evaluation.Use interviews primarily for affinity and culture fit.    "one of my favorite questions is just, what is a personality trait that defines you? So, really, one that you are filled with strength, but that also can be seen as something you're working to improve."  Tactical:  Ask candidates for a personality trait that is both a strength and a weakness.

Tactical:  Ask the candidate to explain a topic to a grandparent and then to a technical expert to test their communication range.

"I always have a presentation component to the interview process that checks for prepared thinking communication. And I recommend a prep call between the two of us before that presentation. And I actually will give feedback on the presentation. And what this gives me signal is what is it actually going to be like to work together?"  Tactical:  Include a presentation component in the final roundSchedule a 1:1 prep call with the candidate before their presentationProvide specific feedback or data during the prep call to see how they adapt their work    "Usually hiring manager screen, and I actually do the live problem solving at this screen.

Curious to get your thoughts, what would you want to change?'"  Tactical:  Ask candidates to pull up the live product during the interviewAsk 'why' repeatedly to uncover their underlying mental modelsFocus on how they approach the problem rather than just the final answer

"For the longest time, they had... a founder had to interview you in order for you to receive an offer... With Stephen, it would be, you'd be chatting about philosophy for an hour and a half and it would very much just be like he would pick a topic out of thin air. It was impossible to prepare for, and then he would just go very, very deep and try and test the limits of your understanding."

"A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device... they've decided that they will answer only two of your questions and after that they expect a plan. What two questions do you ask? ...all of a sudden the sharp product managers, engineers, so basically every role, they very quickly find what are the one or two eigenquestions on this topic."

"one of my favorite interview questions is asking, 'describe to me a time when you're part of controversial product decision, and what did you do,' and all those things. And I think it's really revealing because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides in such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, then they can do it in this even-keeled way, where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives."  Tactical:  Ask candidates to describe a controversial product decisionEvaluate if the candidate can represent both sides of a conflict fairlyTest for 'imagination' by asking candidates to predict the outcome of a hypothetical experiment
