Usability Testing  Usability testing is the practice of watching users interact with your product to identify friction, confusion, and unexpected behaviors. It's not 'junior' work; micro-level testing can drive massive business value through small, tactical optimizations. Always present multiple options and never trust your own internal intuition.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 11 experts.

1 Test with users who have zero skin in the game  Recruit prospective users who aren't invested in the product's success to ensure honest, unbiased feedback. Use platforms like UserTesting.com or Voicepanel to automate recruitment. Watch them struggle and listen to them describe their thought process in real-time.

Featured guest perspectives

"We would have an idea in the morning, come up with some sort of functional prototype, recruit a bunch of people that are legitimately good prospective users, but have zero skin in the game, ship fast so people can start playing with it. In the afternoon, we're already running pretty full scale experiment."

— Grant Lee    "It's amazing to me how you can find 10 random people on the internet and they can give such astute feedback that then is so representative for such a large number of people."

— Melanie Perkins        2 Use faked versions to validate before coding  Run 'Wizard of Oz' tests where humans manually perform automated tasks behind a facade. Use 'Fake Door' tests to measure user intent and click-through rates on features that don't exist yet. Progress from 'fish fooding' (team) to 'dogfooding' (company) to alphas to increase confidence iteratively.

Featured guest perspectives

"Initially you fake it, you do a fake door test, you do a smoke test, Wizard of Oz tests. We used a lot of those in the tabbed inbox by the way, one of the first early versions was actually we showed the tabbed inbox working to people. But it wasn't really Gmail, it was just a facade of HTML..."

— Itamar Gilad        3 Always test multiple design options  Testing a single design is ineffective for predicting behavior. Users could love or hate any design; you need relative comparison. Always present multiple variations to measure which one best drives the target behavior.

Featured guest perspectives

"We never do a UX study where we're just showing people one thing because they could really like it or hate it, but they could really like or hate all the designs. We have no idea. So, when we're doing this, we always present multiple options."

— Kristen Berman        4 Don't skip small, tactical optimizations  Micro-level usability testing can drive millions of dollars in value. Look for 'scary' or confusing CTAs that might be blocking the conversion funnel. Small changes to button text or labels often have outsized impact on business metrics.

Featured guest perspectives

"The micro level, there's so much business value to be derived there... We changed the text on the button with help from our amazing content design... We basically changed seven characters and made Airbnb millions of dollars, because what we found out was really simple. It was just like, 'Hey, this button feels scary.'"

— Judd Antin        5 Engage the whole team in live sessions  Increase team engagement by having cross-functional teams live-react to usability sessions in a shared chat thread. Create a dedicated Slack thread for each live session. Encourage engineers and designers to share real-time observations and pain points.

Featured guest perspectives

"What we wound up doing, especially in the pandemic when we first went remote, is now you can dial into usability sessions and to make it really attractive for the team, what we would do is have people live in a thread, write their real time thoughts... Then you wind up having the PMs, the engineers, designers and the user researcher all in one Slack thread live, responding, reacting to usability session."

— Noah Weiss

✗ Common Mistakes

Testing only one design option instead of comparing multipleRelying on dogfooding alone without external user validationDismissing usability testing as 'junior' work when it's high-leverageNot including PMs and designers in live testing sessions     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

You regularly discover unexpected behaviors that improve product decisionsSmall optimizations from testing drive measurable business impactThe whole team participates in and cares about usability researchYou can run from idea to prototype to user test within a single day

"We've seen product managers build, like I said, like a v1 of an app and actually go out and test it with users. I can't name the company, but there's a public company that have used Replit to test a v1 of an app. And obviously after that sort of works, they take it to the engineers and they're like, 'Okay, we built this thing. We think it's a great thing. We test it with some users.'"  Tactical:  Build a functional v1 independently to validate ideas with users before putting them on the official engineering roadmap.

"Go observe people going through self-checkout at Target... then go watch it at some other grocery store where it's not as great and really notice what happens with people... Just go watch somebody over 70 fumble with a chip card insert or watch somebody try to figure out Apple Pay."  Tactical:  Conduct 'reality checks' by watching users interact with competitor products to see their unbiased behavior and needs.

"We would have an idea in the morning, come up with some sort of functional prototype, recruit a bunch of people that are legitimately good prospective users, but have zero skin in the game, ship fast so people can start playing with it. In the afternoon, we're already running pretty full scale experiment. You start actually hearing other people describe their usage of the product. We can also watch them struggle. By the evening or by the next day. We can actually go through all of it together and say, okay, we're going back and we have to fix this."  Tactical:  Recruit prospective users with 'zero skin in the game' to ensure honest feedback.Watch users struggle and listen to them describe their thought process in real-time.Use platforms like Voicepanel or UserTesting to automate and scale the recruitment process.

"Another aspect of exposure hours is that you tend to overrate how well your products work. It's very important to give your product to another person and watch them interact with it, expose yourself to the pain of reality. And the more you submerge yourself in the real deal, nitty-gritty of what happens when people use your interfaces and whatnot, I think you you'll come out stronger."  Tactical:  Invite customers to demo how they use the product live to the executive team or the whole company.Watch for 'pain points' or non-intuitive behaviors that aren't captured in automated metrics.

We used a lot of those in the tabbed inbox by the way, one of the first early versions was actually we showed the tabbed inbox working to people.

Tactical:  Run 'Wizard of Oz' tests where humans manually perform the automated task behind a facadeUse 'Fake Door' tests to measure user intent and click-through rates on non-existent features    "Initially you fake it, mid-level tests are about building a rough version of it... those are early adopter programs, alphas, longitudinal user studies and fish food. Fish food is testing on your own team."  Tactical:  Implement 'Fish Fooding' to catch immediate bugs and UX flaws within the core teamRun longitudinal studies to see how user behavior changes over time before a full launch

Tactical:  Don't dismiss usability testing as 'junior' work; it is high-leverage for business metrics.Look for 'scary' or confusing CTAs that might be blocking the conversion funnel.    "Doing product walkthroughs to identify lists of potential issues is a great thing to do. Prioritizing that list, figuring out which ones are more or less a problem, and for whom is an area where you should be extremely wary of relying on your own opinion... Some things with a product... you need a pulse to recognize."  Tactical:  Use dogfooding to create a list of potential issues, but use research to prioritize them.Acknowledge that your internal intuition is biased by your knowledge of the product.

"I had a big working session planned with my users to do research with them, or do user testing, and breaking news breaks, and it takes so much time and effort to gather a team of editors across the globe to do a user testing session. And when breaking news happens, they have to prioritize that over everything."  Tactical:  Build in buffers and backups for research sessions involving busy stakeholdersBe prepared to pivot or reschedule at a moment's notice    "We create a script and do a simulation of a breaking news scenario to stress test our platform, because all breaking news scenarios are definitely not the same either. This gives us a lot of great feedback in that short amount of time at the speed of breaking news."  Tactical:  Script realistic scenarios for users to play out in the productHave engineers and support teams observe the simulation in real-time to identify friction points

Uri Levine 1 quote

"Watch new users. Simply watch users and see what they're doing. And number two, if they're not doing what you expect them to do, then ask them why, because this why is the one that is going to make your product successful."  Tactical:  Observe users without intervening to see how they actually use the product.Ask 'why' when a user deviates from the expected path.
