Designing Surveys  Surveys are a scalable way to gather quantitative signal about user needs, willingness to pay, and product-market fit. Well-designed surveys avoid common pitfalls like double-barreled questions and NPS's imprecision, and they can even increase conversion by reassuring users they're in the right place.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 9 experts.

1 Target the right respondents at the right time  Survey 'best' customers who signed up 3-6 months ago so their memory of the 'before' state is fresh. Ask what was happening in their life when they first started seeking a solution. For profiling, limit onboarding surveys to 3-4 screens to maintain completion rates.

Featured guest perspectives

"We identified SparkToro's best customers... very importantly, they signed up for your product recently enough that they remember what life was like before. So generally, we say that's in the three to six-month range."

— Gia Laudi    "Profile your people, know who you're talking to. It's more important than a couple percentage drop-off that will never going to activate in the first place."

— Elena Verna        2 Use CSAT over NPS for precision  NPS makes survey science mistakes and is less correlated to business outcomes than simple Customer Satisfaction (CSAT). Use 5-7 item scales for better precision and ensure all scale options are visible on mobile screens to avoid bias.

Featured guest perspectives

"NPS is the best example of the marketing industry marketing itself... the consensus in the survey science community is that NPS makes all the mistakes... Customer satisfaction, a simple CSAT metric, is better. It has better data properties, it is more precise, it is more correlated to business outcomes."

— Judd Antin        3 Force prioritization in your questions  Use MaxDiff (most/least important) surveys or 100-point allocation questions to identify true value drivers. Limit respondents to picking their top three barriers to keep data clean. Measure the frequency of issues (hourly vs. quarterly) to weight their impact properly.

Featured guest perspectives

"Identify the most important for you, and the least important... If you do this a few times, you will be able to prioritize the entire feature set in a relative fashion, and truly understand what drives willingness to pay."

— Madhavan Ramanujam    "You can just ask a few questions... let them pick three, just three. Of those three, how often does this affect you? Is this hourly? Is this daily? Is this weekly?"

— Nicole Forsgren        4 Avoid double-barreled questions  Each question should ask about one specific variable. 'Were the build and test system slow or complicated?' asks four different things. Review survey questions with an LLM or expert to identify and fix ambiguous phrasing.

Featured guest perspectives

"A lot of folks go to write a survey question and they'll say something like, 'Were the build and test system slow or complicated in the last week?' You're asking four different questions there."

— Nicole Forsgren        5 Use surveys as 'good friction' to increase conversion  Counter-intuitively, adding targeted questions can increase conversion by reassuring users they're in the right place. Ask about coding language or use case early in the flow. Test adding questions even if it seems to contradict friction-reduction principles.

Featured guest perspectives

"We just asked for forgiveness and put these questions into the silent flow and ran as Navy test with a small group... An improved conversion by like 5%, just improved signups."

— Laura Schaffer

✗ Common Mistakes

Relying on NPS when CSAT is more precise and business-correlatedAsking double-barreled questions that conflate multiple variablesSurveying the wrong customers (too new or too old to remember their journey)Asking users to rank features without forcing prioritization     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Survey data clearly identifies your top value driversRespondents complete surveys without confusion or drop-offSurvey insights align with behavioral data you observeOnboarding questions increase conversion rather than hurting it

"run an ad for your podcast... what was my click-through rate on the ad? Which will tell you if someone doesn't click, it's either not a good description or it's not a good set of content... if they don't subscribe... my content probably sucks."  Tactical:  Use click-through rates (CTR) to test the appeal of your product's description or imageryUse conversion rates to validate if the actual product meets the expectations set by the marketing

"Profile your people, know who you're talking to. It's more important than a couple percentage drop-off that will never going to activate in the first place. No, no, no die user please because all of us are tired of receiving outbound that is not relevant to us."  Tactical:  Ask about company size, department, seniority, and use case during sign-upLimit onboarding profiling to 3-4 screens to maintain completion rates

"We identified SparkToro's best customers. Now, what I mean by best customers is those that get a ton of value from your product as of exist today, pay obviously. They're happy. They're low maintenance. And very importantly, they signed up for your product recently enough that they remember what life was like before. So generally, we say that's in the three to six-month range."  Tactical:  Target survey participants who have been customers for 3-6 monthsAsk what was going on in their life when they first started seeking a solutionIdentify the 'trigger moment' that led them to search for a product

"We just asked for forgiveness and put these questions into the silent flow and ran as Navy test with a small group... I'm not kidding, an improved conversion. There's no personalization, nothing past it, just the questions. An improved conversion by like 5%, just improved signups."  Tactical:  Ask questions about the user's coding language or specific use case early in the flowUse questions to alleviate the user's fear that the product won't support their needsTest adding questions to the signup flow even if it seems counterintuitive to reducing friction

"Identify the most important for you, and the least important... If you do this a few times, you will be able to prioritize the entire feature set in a relative fashion, and truly understand what drives willingness to pay."  Tactical:  Present subsets of features and ask respondents to pick the 'most important' and 'least important'Use purchase probability scales (1-5) to build demand curves, discounting '4s' and '5s' to reflect real-world behavior

"We would make a list of our features that we had and maybe new things we wanted to build and have people rank them as a must-have, nice to have, or not necessary that help us understand the relative prioritization. You can also get at it with a hundred point question where you give users a hundred points and say, 'Spend them across these different features.'"  Tactical:  Use a '100-point question' to force users to prioritize feature valueCategorize features as 'must-have', 'nice-to-have', or 'not necessary'

"You can just ask a few questions, 'How satisfied are you? What are the biggest barriers to your productivity, or what are the biggest challenges to getting work done?' and let them pick either from a set of tools or maybe a set of processes and then say... Let them pick three, just three. Of those three, how often does this affect you? Is this hourly? Is this daily? Is this weekly? Is this quarterly?"  Tactical:  Limit respondents to picking their top three barriers to keep data clean.Measure the frequency of issues (e.g., hourly vs. quarterly) to weight their impact.    "A lot of folks go to write a survey question and they'll say something like, 'Were the build and test system slow or complicated in the last week?' You're asking four different questions there. If someone answers yes, was it the build? Was it the test? Was it slow or was it flaky or complicated or something?"  Tactical:  Ensure each survey question only asks about one specific variable (e.g., separate 'speed' from 'complexity').Review survey questions with an LLM or expert to identify and fix ambiguous phrasing.

"We ask customers, is the short answer. So, we have an attribution model, as you can imagine, and we've had one from the early days, and it overlays all the referrer data and cookie data you have on visits comes to the website. So you kind of know that. And then you obviously have the soundtrack stuff, and we sample, and ask customers a set of questions on this, and then overlay that onto the... What turns up in your web tracking as direct traffic to give us a sense of how big that word of mouth number is"  Tactical:  Integrate attribution questions directly into the user flowOverlay survey responses with referrer and cookie data to validate direct trafficSample customers regularly to maintain a clear picture of acquisition sources
