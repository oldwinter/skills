Competitive Analysis  Competitive analysis is essential for positioning your product effectively in the market, identifying strategic opportunities, and understanding the forces that shape customer decisions. Done well, it reveals not just who your competitors are, but how customers perceive their alternatives and where you can create unique value.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 49 experts.

1 Define your competitive alternatives, not just competitors  Your real competition often isn't other startups building similar products. It includes the status quo (spreadsheets, manual processes), non-consumption, and workarounds customers use today. In B2B, about 40% of deals are lost to 'no decision,' meaning you lost to the existing way of doing things. Start by identifying what customers would do if your product didn't exist.

Featured guest perspectives

"The first step in a good positioning exercise is to really understand, what do we have to position against? So put another way, it's like saying, what do I have to beat in order to win a deal?"

— April Dunford    "Most folks will discount the status quo, but they shouldn't because in B2B we lose about 40% of our deals to quote-unquote, 'no decision,' which actually means we lost to the spreadsheet, we lost to pen and paper, we lost to interns."

— April Dunford    "What's the competition for solving that problem? How do they solve it today? And what are the alternatives? How else do people solve this? What are the workarounds?"

— Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky        2 Reverse-engineer competitor strategy from their product  Don't just list competitor features. Use their product deeply and infer the internal trade-offs, constraints, and strategic bets they've made. This reveals their underlying priorities and helps you identify where their strengths create weaknesses you can exploit.

Featured guest perspectives

"I can tell you from using it what instructions they were given, that team was given. I can tell you what they were optimizing for. I can tell you what constraints they were under."

— Boz    "The great startups, they create movements not so much by criticizing the incumbent, but by showing the weakness in the strength of the incumbent."

— Mike Maples Jr        3 Categorize the market into approaches, not just vendors  Help customers understand their options by grouping competitors into distinct approaches or philosophies, not just company names. This positions you as the trusted advisor who understands the market deeply, and creates a mental model where you occupy a unique quadrant.

Featured guest perspectives

"What we should be doing is giving them a way to think about the whole market and say, in the case of Help Scout, 'Look, there's shared inbox and then there's help desk software and then there's us.' And I don't care who the vendor is, I'm going to put them in one of those buckets."

— April Dunford    "We want to have a way of looking at the world that puts all of the competitors into Loserville. And then we want to say, okay, if you can deliver on that and if that promise is compelling to customers."

— Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky        4 Distribute competitive intelligence across the team  Competitive analysis shouldn't be one person's job. Assign specific competitors to team members who deeply immerse themselves in those products. Then bring everyone together to share findings and identify patterns. This creates organizational muscle memory around competitive dynamics.

Featured guest perspectives

"We have assigned people into groups for the quarter to own a competitor. Their job is to essentially spend a lot of time immersing themselves into the product of the competitor, really trying to think through the lens of, do a SWAT analysis... then we have the competitive war gaming day where every team comes and presents."

— Annie Pearl    "Go have a conversation with sales and see why people were buying competitors? What was your win-loss analysis? Why are we losing? What do you think is the issue?"

— Melissa Perri        5 Identify your asymmetric advantage  In competitive strategy, the fundamental source of power is asymmetry. Find something you have, know, or can do that competitors cannot easily match. This could be unique technology, network effects, brand trust, or deep customer understanding that took years to build.

Featured guest perspectives

"In a competitive situation, the fundamental aspect of power is something that's going to give you some sort of advantage. Usually it's in asymmetry of some kind. If two fighters are equally balanced... it's 50/50. For a strategy you need to exploit in asymmetry of some kind."

— Richard Rumelt    "What makes Netflix hard to copy? ... Original content ... Brand ... Personalization ... Economies of scale ... Network effects."

— Gibson Biddle    "You have to be either differentiated or low cost, there's no way to protect yourself if you're not one of those two."

— Roger Martin        6 Use competitors for inspiration, not imitation  Know what competitors are doing, but avoid blindly copying their features or flows. Their choices may be unoptimized, context-specific, or based on constraints you don't share. Use competitive intelligence to identify patterns and validate hypotheses, not as a substitute for your own customer research.

Featured guest perspectives

"Knowing what your competition is doing is extremely important... But blatantly saying, 'Hey, we're going to copy all of these best tactics or all of these flows because, hey, they're doing better than us. Let's just rip them and do exactly the same.' That's where things really go wrong because every single experience is very unique to their customer, to their channel."

— Elena Verna    "Competitive myopia, don't fall for it... your competitor, if you think of what they do as an iceberg, the top side, what comes out of the water is what they've shipped in terms of features, but it's based on all this stuff that they've built in terms of research and understanding of their customer base and everything else."

— Tanguy Crusson

✗ Common Mistakes

Ignoring the status quo as a competitor - spreadsheets and manual processes are often your biggest competitionCopying competitor features without understanding the underlying research and context that led to those decisionsObsessing over direct startup competitors while ignoring how customers actually solve the problem todayAssuming technical superiority or feature parity is enough to win - distribution and momentum often matter moreReacting to every competitor announcement instead of staying anchored in your own customer research     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

You can articulate not just what competitors build, but why they made those trade-offsYour positioning gives customers a clear mental model for understanding the entire marketSales conversations shift from feature comparisons to strategic fit discussionsYou win deals against the status quo, not just other vendorsTeam members across the company have a shared understanding of the competitive landscape

"the first step in a good positioning exercise is to really understand, what do we have to position against? So put another way, it's like saying, what do I have to beat in order to win a deal? So in positioning work we call this competitive alternatives."  Tactical:  Identify what you have to beat to win a dealLook beyond direct competitors to 'competitive alternatives'    "Most folks will discount the status quo, but they shouldn't because in B2B we lose about 40% of our deals to quote-unquote, 'no decision,' which actually means we lost to the spreadsheet, we lost to pen and paper, we lost to interns. And if we're not positioning well against that, we're never going to get the customer to come off of that."  Tactical:  Position specifically against the 'status quo' (e.g., spreadsheets or manual work)Address the 'no decision' risk by highlighting the cost of sticking with current processes    "What we should be doing is giving them a way to think about the whole market and say, in the case of Help Scout, 'Look, there's shared inbox and then there's help desk software and then there's us.' And I don't care who the vendor is, I'm going to put them in one of those buckets."  Tactical:  Group competitors into buckets based on their fundamental approach to the problem.Acknowledge the strengths of other approaches for specific types of customers to build trust.Position your product as the only one that fits the 'perfect world' criteria you've established.

"When we talk about category, I think it's really what would be a good way to explore your space and your relevant categories would be to go to G2 Crowd or Software Advice or any of those type of review sites or directory sites and learn about how they've categorized products based on feature sets."

Hamilton Helmer 3 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Understanding whether or not there is a type of power in place is hard... It comes down to the hard part is industry economics is what really are the economic relationships and it's very hard."  Tactical:  Analyze the specific economic relationships in your industry to determine if a perceived advantage is actually a durable power.    "People often think that they get scale economies through data. And I'd say that that's possible, but it's rare. And the reason it's rare is not because there aren't scale economies in data, but rather that the range of scale that the existing competitors have are often large enough to be able to put them in shouting distance of each so that the differences in their cost per unit is not that great."  Tactical:  Check if your data advantage actually creates a material cost or price difference that competitors cannot bridge.    "Netflix in an earlier phase was fighting Blockbuster... If you look at the Blockbuster site, their UI site, you couldn't tell it different from Netflix. They just copied it. And so all that thoughtfulness about which things you put first and how you structure it and all that to make this suitable was mimicable."  Tactical:  Distinguish between 'castle' features (durable power) and 'shack' features (easily copied UI/UX) when assessing your competitive position.

Jessica Hische 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I mean, everybody that does branding, one of the things that they do is they analyze the competitors of the company. You just look at a landscape of what are all the competitors doing, what is their visual vibe, and do I lean into that or do I avoid that? If I lean into it, then I'm immediately getting this... Everyone that looks at it understands I'm a FinTech company because I look like a FinTech company. If my whole thing is I'm trying to be divergent from that, I'm trying to show how different I am from the status quo, then you use it as a reactionary thing of I want to do nothing like that and do something really different so people understand this isn't just another FinTech company."  Tactical:  Map the visual landscape of competitors to decide whether to align with or react against industry standards.Use industry-standard colors (like green for FinTech) if you want instant category association, or avoid them to signal divergence.

Tactical:  Create a dedicated slide in the pitch deck that maps out all current playersExplicitly highlight the 'huge gap' in the market your product fills compared to incumbents    "One of the most important things that we did was we didn't really worry about competitors at all.

Tactical:  Evaluate if your product is a 'coin flip' for customers; if so, you lack a winning strategy.Choose a path: either build the scale for low cost or the uniqueness for differentiation.    "The ultimate way to compete to win is to never actually be forced to compete."  Tactical:  Look for 'fault lines' where a competitor's existing business model prevents them from copying you (counter-positioning).Build multifaceted capabilities that are harder to replicate than a single asset like a factory or a feature.

"I actually think that the most interesting markets, you have to think of them like currents where you're there's something happening in the market that's creating this current where you can have a plank of wood that you've put on the river and it's going to pull you forward. Versus a market that doesn't really have that momentum to it, you're going to have to build something really big and fancy to make any progress."  Tactical:  Identify the 'why now' or the dynamics of change that will provide tailwinds for the product    "The more dominant a marketplace is relative to the number two in its space, the more profitable that business is... you don't want to be in the middle of the pack, but even being number one but just barely number one doesn't give you any of the benefits of a marketplace model."

"In everything always talk from the customer's perspective, from the market's perspective, from the competitor's perspective, the very small number of PMs do that."  Tactical:  Start every document from the perspective of the customer, market, or competitor.    "You can copy and paste one of your competitor's positioning documents into ChatGPT and say, 'Is this a better fit for what they have said than my thing?'"  Tactical:  Use LLMs to summarize competitor public documents to reverse-engineer their likely product strategy.Ask AI to find where a competitor's strategy might be more compelling to a customer than your own.    "It's the years and years and years of evolution of the underlying workflows of the product to support the customers, but also the customers evolving those workflows to make them work the way they do. And so how does that impact AI companies? You could say, 'It's easier than ever to build forms on a database application.' And so I'm like, 'Yeah, okay, that presumably drives the incremental value of every new one of those to zero, right?'"  Tactical:  Focus on building proprietary business rules and workflows that reflect the specific processes of your customers to increase switching costs.

And so you're just seeing the manifestation of what they were thinking maybe a year ago, based on what they're shipping now."

"bringing an outside in perspective, really benchmarking against your competitors and your competitive set... our buyers are shopping all over the internet.

Uri Levine 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"When iPhone was introduced, Microsoft basically say this will never work. They were in a position of a market leader, they own Windows mobile operating system that was running on pretty much all the phones in the world... They haven't realized how impactful it is. So this is a competition coming out to the market with something that is completely different. And not only disrupt the market but actually create crisis for pretty much everyone else."  Tactical:  Evaluate competitors not just on features, but on how they might fundamentally change user expectations (e.g., touchscreens vs. keypads).    "Waze was focusing on the daily commuters. So we wanted people to use our application twice a day, when you go to the office and when you come back home. And Google Maps is something that you are being used not that frequent... So a different use case and obviously different product that is built for the specificity of the use case."  Tactical:  Identify a specific use case (like daily commuting) to differentiate from a broader market incumbent.Build product features specifically for the frequency and context of that chosen use case.

"Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, has this amazing quote. He says, 'Fish where the fish are.' And he gives this example, he says, 'If you're a fisherman and you see a large pond and all around the pond, there's a whole bunch of fishermen and they're all elbowing each other out of the way... You actually want to walk off into the forest and find a small fishing hole with lots of fish and very little competition.'"  Tactical:  Avoid 'flashy' businesses like restaurants or cafes where competition is hyper-saturated.Look for 'boring' niches like pest control, funeral homes, or government form-filling software.Identify markets where you can be a 'big fish' in a small pond rather than competing with 'commercial fishermen' in large markets.    "The biggest mistakes I've made have been going into business models where other people have repeatedly failed and thinking, I can do this better... you can't take a brilliant management team and change a bad business model. Ultimately the business model wins."  Tactical:  Research the history of a business model to see if others have repeatedly failed.Don't assume your management talent can overcome a structurally poor industry (e.g., local news or low-margin retail).Prioritize the business model over the team's brilliance.

"With AI, it's just intensified because you have 10 players pursuing the same market opportunity and so your ability to actually bring the product to market to differentiate yourself from the competition has become more strategically important than it was previously."  Tactical:  Focus on how you are better than competitors rather than just the pain point you solve.

"The attributes of that business and that product category mean, you have to win on how much do people love your product and feel an emotional connection to it, and choose your brand, your product over the other, almost not rationally, but emotionally... In many ways it's capitalistic. This is how we win this market"  Tactical:  Identify if your category is a 'commodity' market where brand is the only differentiatorOptimize for 'feelings' (joy, surprise, speed) to create non-rational loyalty

"Every single day, every single time somebody is pushing your code to production and you're releasing a feature or an enhancement, you are making the product better or you're making the product worse, but the products never remain same. So with every release that your competitor is making and every release that you're making, you are either making chess points, moves against them, positive points, or you're going negative."  Tactical:  Evaluate every feature release based on whether it moves you ahead of or behind the competition in the customer's mind.Recognize that products never remain static; they are constantly being compared to the evolving market.    "The success of a company is a direct relation of what the competition allows you to do. I feel like not many people talk about that, but in many cases in my professional career... every single instance when I looked at a company accelerated their growth or there was a deceleration of growth, it was a direct relation to what the competition allowed you to do."  Tactical:  Analyze competition across three dimensions: solution quality, distribution outreach, and pricing/packaging.Identify your unique place in the tech ecosystem to ensure customers understand your specific value relative to incumbents.
