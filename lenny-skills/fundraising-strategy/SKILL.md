Fundraising Strategy  Fundraising strategy is the skill of raising venture capital effectively - knowing when to raise, how to pitch, and how to navigate the investor landscape. This includes understanding the trade-offs of the 'venture treadmill' and knowing when alternative paths like bootstrapping might be better for your specific situation.

Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 2 experts.

1 Question whether you should raise at all  Before optimizing your fundraising, question whether venture capital is right for your business. Raising money creates expectations of venture-scale returns that constrain your options. Many successful businesses are better served by bootstrapping or raising less, maintaining more control and flexibility.

Featured guest perspectives

"I do spend time, ironically, like challenging founders sometimes when they're thinking about raising or thinking about an idea to- to not raise."

— Ryan Hoover        2 Lead with your strongest point  Your first slide creates the first impression that colors everything that follows. Don't bury your best material - lead with it. If you have a remarkable metric, a notable founder background, or a breakthrough insight, put it first. Most decks waste the first slide on generic company descriptions.

Featured guest perspectives

"Most people are missing the most important slide of their presentation is the first slide... This is the place that you're going to put your strongest point."

— Uri Levine        3 Prepare for the dance of 100 nos  Fundraising is a numbers game where rejection is the norm. Expect to hear 'no' many times before you get a 'yes.' This isn't failure - it's the standard process. Managing your psychology through this process is as important as managing the pitch itself.
