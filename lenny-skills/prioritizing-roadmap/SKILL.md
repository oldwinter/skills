Prioritizing Roadmap  Prioritization is the highest-leverage skill for product managers. It's not about scoring features in a spreadsheet—it's about making hard trade-offs that concentrate resources on the work most likely to matter. The best prioritization connects tactical decisions to strategic goals, says no to good ideas to make room for great ones, and acknowledges that you can't do everything, so you must choose wisely.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 75 experts.

1 Connect every feature to the strategic goal  A roadmap isn't a list of features with impact scores. It's a narrative that explains why specific investments matter and how they ladder up to company strategy. Every tactical item should connect through a clear logic chain to business metrics. If you can't draw that line, the item probably doesn't belong on the roadmap.

Featured guest perspectives

"You're telling a story. So what I want from you is I want themes, I want a story. Why are these things the biggest things to invest in these levers, the biggest ones to pull? And what I really don't want... is people thinking a spreadsheet with a bunch of projects, the RICE framework, everything has an impact, a cost and an effort column filled out. They think that is prioritization and that is a roadmap."

— Jiaona Zhang    "A good test is you go to all of your teams, and you ask them what they're doing and why... They can connect everything they're doing, from the tactical stuff on the team, all the way back up to the business metrics."

— Melissa Perri    "I think a good strategy is all about connecting the dots. Connecting the dots from this high level business goal of, 'We want to increase revenue by this much' to, 'This is the feature we're going to do.'"

— Jackie Bavaro        2 Balance big bets with incremental work using portfolio thinking  Treat your roadmap as a diversified portfolio. Allocate a specific percentage to high-risk 'cannonballs' and the rest to 'lead bullets' and maintenance. Early-stage products should lean heavily toward big bets; mature products need more balance. Without explicit allocation, teams drift toward safe, incremental work that never moves the needle.

Featured guest perspectives

"I'm going to have some cannonballs. I'm going to work on a couple cannonballs and I'm going to have a bunch of lead bullets. And maybe it's 80% of your energies on those big cannonballs, 20% on the lead bullets."

— Adriel Frederick    "70/20/10 investments model... 70% of your building time should really be going to your core product, that has product market fit. 20% of your time should be going to strategic initiatives that aren't core... And then, 10% of your time should be going towards bets."

— Eeke de Milliano    "I think the way that we think about our roadmap for any feature team at Slack is that it's a portfolio and it's meant to be a portfolio that's diversified... things that are meant to be risky that you aren't sure are going to work but might have a lot of upside versus things that are known bets."

— Noah Weiss        3 Focus ruthlessly on the one thing that matters most  Great prioritization requires the courage to say no to good ideas. Find the single most important thing and stay with it until it's done. Don't spread your team across ten priorities—pick one or two that will actually move the needle. The hardest part isn't finding good ideas; it's having the discipline to ignore them.

Featured guest perspectives

"The best PMs not only can find the one thing to work on, but they can stay with that one thing long enough to actually finish it."

— Maggie Crowley    "You don't win by doing 10 things well. You win by doing one thing really well and maybe you fail nine things. This is the thing that I've told the company, 'This is very different than school,' right? In school you optimize for your total GPA. But for companies, I just need to get an A+ on the one class that matters."

— Varun Mohan    "You are one of the best people I've ever worked with at solving problems three through 100, but I need you stuck on problems one and two."

— Jeff Weinstein        4 Use frameworks like ICE, but don't over-index on them  Prioritization frameworks like ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) provide a shared language for comparing ideas, but they're not a substitute for judgment. The danger is that confidence and effort scores can kill high-impact ideas too early. Spend time exploring high-reach ideas before scoring them, and ensure 'impact' is measured in the same units as your actual goals.

Featured guest perspectives

"I suggest using ICE, impact, confidence and ease... a way to assign three values to each idea. Use 'Ease' (the opposite of effort) to keep the scoring intuitive. Evaluate impact specifically against the North Star metric or top business KPI."

— Itamar Gilad    "One of the traps with RICE that we observed is that the C and E, the confidence and effort tends to cause you to prematurely deprioritize potentially high reach, high impact bets... ignore the C and E for a little longer than it's comfortable, and just sit with those high reach, high impact ideas."

— Vijay    "Are we estimating and measuring impact in the same unit of measure as our goals? Because if we're doing that, then we're keeping ourselves honest."

— Matt LeMay        5 Be willing to blow up the roadmap when context changes  Roadmaps are not commitments—they're hypotheses. In crisis or when the market shifts, be willing to throw away the existing plan and radically simplify to a handful of mission-critical items. The ability to pivot quickly is more valuable than rigid adherence to a plan that no longer makes sense.

Featured guest perspectives

"It is a real wartime moment where you just need to blow up roadmaps, share context with everyone and say, 'Okay, everyone, we have a totally different mandate than what we did a couple weeks ago.'"

— Alex Hardimen    "We went down from trying to ship maybe the 40 things that quarter to three and nothing else mattered. And that became the rhythm of the company for almost that entire year."

— Brandon Chu    "Being agile, not being stuck with roadmaps, being able to just say, oh, we're just going to switch priorities right away, is going to be super important... there's going to be capabilities that are going to drop. And you want to... be able to jump on it really, really quickly."

— Amjad Masad        6 Organize by outcomes, not features  Shift from 'release roadmaps' that promise specific features by dates to 'outcome roadmaps' that commit to goals and metrics. This maintains flexibility for discovery while keeping the team aligned on what matters. Features are hypotheses; outcomes are what you're actually trying to achieve.

Featured guest perspectives

"I recommend using outcome roadmaps saying by October we want to achieve this outcome... Otherwise you want to keep it open and the roadmaps can kind of suffocate this process if you decide upfront with low confidence that this particular idea must be launched."

— Itamar Gilad    "The whole point about a roadmap is that it's not designed to be your plan. I think about it as being a prototype for your strategy... we came up with a three column roadmap, current, near term, future, which became now, next, later."

— Janna Bastow    "Instead of just talking about features, it's typically talking about features for the first 90 to 120 days, but after that we just talk about struggling moments because that's the seed for real innovation."

— Bob Moesta

✗ Common Mistakes

Treating the roadmap as a feature spreadsheet instead of a strategic narrativeSpreading resources across too many priorities instead of focusingKilling high-impact ideas too early because of low confidence scoresRefusing to change the roadmap when the market shiftsPrioritizing safe, incremental work over risky, high-upside bets     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Every team member can explain how their work connects to the business goalYou have explicit portfolio allocation between big bets and incremental workYou say no to good ideas regularly to make room for great onesYou can pivot the roadmap in a week when context changesYour roadmap commits to outcomes, not specific features

"Prioritization and road mapping. So you have to be able to sequence the work much like in building a product, right? Building your growth strategy, you have to sequence it. That sequence has to make sense based on your growth models."  Tactical:  Sequence growth experiments based on the potential impact on the growth modelBuild a series of hypotheses to test against solutions to ensure continuous learning

"The idea of being able to take all of these crazy inputs, trying to create a very structured model to figure out, 'Okay, what is true? Where do we have conviction? Where do we have questions? What are the most important problems to solve? How do you prioritize? How do you get a team rallied around a shared context in one single goal?'"  Tactical:  Categorize inputs by conviction level vs. questionsCreate a structured model to identify the most important problemsRally the team around a shared context    "It is a real wartime moment where you just need to blow up roadmaps, share context with everyone and say, 'Okay, everyone, we have a totally different mandate than what we did a couple weeks ago.'"  Tactical:  Be prepared to 'blow up' roadmaps during crisisCommunicate a clear new mandate to the entire team immediately

And maybe it's 80% of your energies on those big cannonballs, 20% on the lead bullets, and having a constraint like that forces you to choose the fewer experiments that are actually probably the really good ones."  Tactical:  Allocate a specific percentage of resources (e.g., 80/20) between major bets and small optimizations.Adjust the portfolio based on product maturity: early-stage products should focus almost entirely on 'cannonballs'.

"My approach at Google was 70% of my effort and my team's effort should go on things that everybody acknowledges are important and useful and create value. Maybe it's boring, linear value, but some kind of value... once you do this, you have 30% of your extra time that you can plant all these seeds."  Tactical:  Allocate 70% of team effort to projects that are unambiguously recognized as important by the broader organization.Use the remaining 30% to allow team members to pursue 'emergent' ideas that they are intrinsically motivated by.

"We are constantly getting feature requests through sales, through customer success. And we had sort of no way, bar to decide well what do we take on, what don't we take on? And this clearly has become our bar."  Tactical:  Use the narrative's 'new game' rules as a bar for deciding which features to build.Reject features that support the 'old game' or 'old way' of working.

"Being agile, not being stuck with roadmaps, being able to just say, oh, we're just going to switch priorities right away, is going to be super important... there's going to be capabilities that are going to drop. And you want to really, in some cases, if it really affects your business, you want to be able to jump on it really, really quickly."  Tactical:  Maintain a flexible roadmap that can be 'slaughtered' or deprioritized when major AI breakthroughs occur.Build a culture that is comfortable with rapid priority shifts based on external technology drops.

Anuj Rathi 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"We call them... First BB is Brilliant Basics... The second one is Bread and Butter... Then, there are Big Bets... Breaking Bad essentially is a different world altogether. That's where you want to redefine your company... it gets down to product managers eventually prioritizing between these four. So I don't think it's a tactical prioritization product manager call. It really is a product strategy call."  Tactical:  Categorize all work into one of the four BB buckets to visualize resource allocation.Present three alternative allocation strategies to leadership to show the trade-offs between stability (Basics) and innovation (Breaking Bad).Use the framework to explain to stakeholders why certain bugs or features are being deprioritized in favor of existential 'Big Bets'.

Annie Pearl 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I like this framework that's taken from a book called Playing to Win and it talks about how strategy is really just an integrated set of choices that outline how you're going to win in whatever marketplace you choose... it forces you to create clarity around where you're going to play and where you're not going to play. And so, this really helps the product team hone in on delivering value for a very clear set of people versus trying to build something for everyone."  Tactical:  Use the 'Playing to Win' framework to define the playing field.Explicitly decide which features or integrations (e.g., Venmo for Calendly) do not fit the core ICP to avoid dilution.Allocate resources across horizons (e.g., 70/30 split between Horizon 1 and 2) to balance short-term and long-term goals.

"Just top line? I think identifying what is the biggest bottleneck, what's the biggest problem and iterating fast on saying, 'Okay, this is the biggest problem, let's really, really solve that problem.' And then picking in the next one and not overthinking, not dreaming out the long roadmap."  Tactical:  Identify and solve the immediate biggest bottleneckAvoid over-planning long-term roadmaps in fast-changing environments

"We think about it as what season are we in? Season one might've been prototyping of AI and then it was all around models and reasoning models, and now it's the advent of agents... grounding everybody on the ethos of what are the secular changes? What are the customer problems we need to solve? What does winning look like?"  Tactical:  Define the current 'season' based on industry trends (e.g., 'The Rise of Agents')Align the team on the ethos and customer problems specific to that season    "I think the other thing is just we try to leave Slack in the system, not just for the unplanned, but for the slope. I think that we have to continuously be thinking about how we're going to disrupt the platform in our thinking and what we need to be investing in to make that possible."  Tactical:  Reserve capacity for unplanned shifts in the technology landscapeAllocate time for teams to experiment with disrupting their own existing platform

"How do you be really focused on where to invest your time, effort, and energy technically, which is why most of the engineering effort for Uber was on the dispatching system and the pricing system. That's just where the leverage was at the time, given the scarcity of resources."  Tactical:  Focus technical investment on core systems that drive the most business value (e.g., pricing or dispatching)Be explicit and transparent about which areas will not receive technical investment

"The most difficult thing about making that kind of effort is developing a common currency by which you can trade off their efforts. So this team is saying they can move this metric by X and this team is moving this metric by Y. I have no way to make those two things comparable. The growth model is the function that lets you do that."  Tactical:  Run different team scenarios through a central growth model to make their projected impacts comparableUse growth models during annual planning to decide pod allocation from first principles    "TAM or the size of the market actually matters very little because these are all big enough that they would dramatically inflect the curve of the business if you make them work. It's much more relevant to focus on a couple things. One is how adjacent is that to the business as a proxy for can we actually go get it?"  Tactical:  Evaluate new market opportunities based on how closely they mirror your current operational modelPrioritize expansions that accentuate existing network effects (e.g., shared supply or demand)

"70/20/10 investments model... 70% of your building time should really be going to your core product, that has product market fit. 20% of your time should be going to strategic initiatives that aren't core...

Gustav Söderström 1 quote

"The idea is that, roughly, you shouldn't be spending more than 10% of your time planning versus executing or building. Which means that if you're working quarterly 10 weeks, you should spend one week planning."

By Q4 we want to launch in another three countries, or we want to grow our usage in India by that much... Otherwise you want to keep it open and the roadmaps can kind of suffocate this process if you decide upfront with low confidence that this particular idea must be launched."

"When you can be really laser focused on, my goal each quarter is to make this metric go up, I think it's much easier to make sure that you're working on the highest ROI thing.

Jackie Bavaro 1 quote

"A roadmap in strategy is not a commitment. Instead, it's a way to double check if your plan makes any sense at all and is even anywhere near feasible. Because what happens to every team I see do these roadmaps, you put it together and you realize 'We're not going to hit our vision in five years or 10. This is like a 30 year vision, if we keep going at the pace we're going.'"

Tactical:  Use the roadmap to lay out assumptions about problems being solvedShare early assumptions with the team and customers to check if you are on the right path    "So we sat down and we came up with a three column roadmap, current, near term, future, which became now, next, later.

"I think you can go too far either direction, right? It's like everything in life is about balancing the polarity between two opposing forces. And so in this one it's like, yeah, you go too hard in division and theory land... And you just get wrapped around the axle of like, well, that sounds really good in theory, but I have no idea how to even start executing on this... But you could probably go too far into execution land too... It was like, people would be like, 'I'm just going to run through a wall. I have no idea if that's the right wall to run through.'"  Tactical:  Identify if the team is currently 'wrapped around the axle' of theory and needs to shift to executionRecognize when 'ready, fire, aim' execution has lost its strategic direction

"AI research progress is bottlenecked by management, research management. It's because you have constrained set of compute and you need to allocate the compute to the research paths that you feel the most convinced about. It was like you need to have a really high conviction in the research paths to put the compute, and it's more return on investment kind of situation."  Tactical:  Prioritize experiments based on 'return on investment' for compute usage.Cut research paths early if they lack 'signs of life' to save resources for higher-conviction projects.

"The cycles is just a way to say that for the next week or the next two weeks or whatever timeframe, we are going to work on these things and these other things we think are the priority or the focus for this timeframe."  Tactical:  Implement automated cycles (e.g., 1-2 weeks) to define short-term focus.Use cycles to provide a clear 'no' to new requests that fall outside the current timeframe.    "Internally, we also talk about this, you knowing RPG games, you have the main quest lines and then you have the side quest lines. And we often talk about the companies avoid the side quests. There's always ideas people have... This doesn't progress the main quest line, which is building this product and making it awesome for these customers."  Tactical:  Audit the roadmap for 'side quests' that don't directly contribute to the core product mission.Ask: 'Is this important to do now, or can it be done later?' to filter out shiny objects.

"The ritual is essentially you can take any set of problems or solutions or themes or whatever you want to get people's input on, and you put those into a table and then people can basically vote with their dollars and usually you allocate $100. And so people will go through and say, "Oh, I want to allocate $10 to this and $20 to this and $50 to this because I think it's really important.""  Tactical:  Give each team member $100 virtual dollars to distribute across potential projects.Analyze the spread of votes to identify areas of high disagreement for further discussion.

So there's a huge focus on there's this potential shiny reward right in front of us, which is optimize user engagement... And is that really the thing?"  Tactical:  Filter 'shiny' feature requests through the lens of the company's long-term mission.Prioritize reliability and robustness as core tenets before adding new modalities or endpoints.

"Literally, for your product folks, the number one lesson... you cannot prioritize a product roadmap without having a willingness to pay conversation. If you're just prioritizing based on what you think or what you feel or technical resources, you're getting it wrong."  Tactical:  Prioritize the 20% of features that drive 80% of the willingness to payAvoid giving away high-value features for free in an MVP if they are the primary value drivers

"You don't need 20 features to solve a problem. You just need one or two features which work really well. This whole concept of critical user journeys. How do you make sure that, if you're solving problem X, any feature that you build in the product... should be well designed and it should have the focus and prioritization so that you're only getting things for the critical journey so that the user can use it and not get confused."  Tactical:  Keep the initial product scope extremely small to ensure the core problem is solved elegantly.Audit every feature against the 'critical user journey' to ensure it adds value without adding noise.

"The best PMs not only can find the one thing to work on, but they can stay with that one thing long enough to actually finish it."  Tactical:  Find the one truly necessary task among many prioritiesMaintain focus long enough to finish the workBe the person 'beating the drum' to keep the team engaged    "Getting to the one thing you should do is extremely difficult and being able and having the gumption to say no to all those other things is really hard, because there's probably at any given time, 10 things you should do, but you can't do 10 things."  Tactical:  Limit top-line priorities to three or fewerBe willing to take responsibility for the 'bet' of picking one thing over others

"The Low Impact Death Spiral is the dynamic in which every medium to large company I've ever worked with finds itself in one way or another... It starts with adding little features here and there, making little cosmetic improvements because it's easier, it invites less scrutiny and you're less likely to mess up something important"  Tactical:  Identify if your team is working on 'rhinestones' (cosmetic additions) versus the 'engine' (core value).Proactively seek out high-impact work even if it requires more cross-team coordination.    "Are we estimating and measuring impact in the same unit of measure as our goals? Because if we're doing that, then we're keeping ourselves honest and we're saying, 'Does this actually have a chance of contributing?' Whereas again, if we get really clever and we come up with a proprietary scoring system and all these little intermediate steps, we can feel like we're doing really awesome work and being very, very terribly smart. But we again, run the risk that we are going to lose our connection with why we're setting about to do this work in the first place."  Tactical:  Replace abstract impact scores (1-10) with actual projected units of your goal (e.g., 'number of users converted').Use impact estimation to identify 'big bets' that are the only ones capable of hitting the target.

"In a feature team, basically you are handed a typical roadmap. Almost everybody, even though I wish this wasn't the case, almost everybody to have the same thing, that it's a prioritized list of features and projects. So some stakeholders got together, usually quarterly, and they say, "Look, to run our part of the business, we need these features. It's not really complicated. We need these features.""  Tactical:  Recognize that a prioritized list of features is a sign of a 'feature team' cultureMove away from quarterly stakeholder-driven feature lists toward outcome-based planning

"It just always comes back to how do I set strategy, how do I deploy strategy, and how do I make sure it's well communicated and that everything that we're doing on the tech teams, on the product teams, is laddered up into a company strategy that's well prioritized."  Tactical:  Audit the roadmap to ensure every feature or enhancement ladders up to a specific business objective or vision.    "A good test is you go to all of your teams, and you ask them what they're doing and why... They can connect everything they're doing, from the tactical stuff on the team, all the way back up to the business metrics."  Tactical:  Ask team members: 'What are you working on, and how does it move the business metrics or help us enter new markets?'

"Some of the normal things that people would maybe reach for in building the company early on, we really let those fires burn for a long time, especially when it came to things like sales and marketing. And so just working on the product, and building a product that you like first, your team likes, and then also then adjusting it for some set of users, that can kind of sound simple, but then, as you know, it's hard to do that well."  Tactical:  Let 'fires burn' in non-essential areas like sales and marketing to focus 100% on product development.Prioritize building a product that the internal team genuinely loves and uses daily.

"The stuff that we absolutely have to say no to is the exact kind of thing that leads to this bloatedness that makes ICs hate their lives. It's customization features requested by middle managers in order to make reporting a little bit easier at the cost of making IC workflows worse."  Tactical:  Identify where incentives are misaligned between different user types (e.g., managers vs. ICs).Say no to customization requests that add friction to the primary user's workflow.    "At any given moment, we have probably 20 or 30 opportunities that we could possibly explore, just product opportunities, like problems to solve, areas to improve for our users, but they're not ready yet. We don't have enough conviction around how we might approach it. So, we just accumulate understanding of this stuff and periodically, we accumulate some more stuff, and then we reevaluate."  Tactical:  Keep an up-to-date analysis of potential product areas so the whole team can contribute.Wait to action a roadmap item until you have a clear, elegant way to solve a specific part of the problem.

"You have to be ruthless with prioritization as something scales up and put out the largest fires first, because that was something that I didn't really fully understand, is how many things go wrong."

Noah Weiss 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I think the way that we think about, or us to think about our roadmap for any feature team at Slack is that it's a portfolio and it's meant to be a portfolio that's diversified a couple different ways. I think one is you want to diversify things that are meant to be new capabilities versus making the thing you've already built a little bit better every day... Are there things that are meant to be risky that you aren't sure are going to work but might have a lot of upside versus things that are known bets."  Tactical:  Balance 'known bets' with 'risky bets' that have high potential upside.Allocate resources between learning about new possibility spaces and driving confident impact.

"I remember doing really on is actually talking to the leadership team and being like, 'I don't think we should be putting 50 engineers on this project. Looking at the rest of the roadmap and the rest of the priorities, excuse me, I think this team would likely be better served elsewhere.'"  Tactical:  Evaluate your project's relative priority against the entire company roadmapAdvocate for resource reallocation if your project is lower impact, even if it risks your current role

"Difference versus table stakes, very simple... differentiation. So what's different and better? But critically, what's different and better in ways that customers care about?... on the other side, there's a entry requirement or table stakes... They're real basic stuff, boring stuff, and easy to ignore."  Tactical:  Categorize roadmap items into 'Differentiation' vs. 'Table Stakes'.Ensure you aren't building 'different' features that customers don't actually care about.

"Focus, it's the fundamental source of power and strategy. Trying to do too many different things is defocusing."  Tactical:  Limit your action agenda to a few key items rather than a long list of priorities.Avoid 'strategic assembly' where you just list everything you wish would happen.    "Which of your ambitions can you begin to make progress towards reaching, and what's holding you back? What are the barriers? What are the problems? So I approach the question of the problem now through the filter of the ambition."  Tactical:  Filter your ambitions by asking which ones you can actually make progress on today.Focus on 'addressable challenges' that overlap with your high-level goals.

"You can classify anything that you build in a company into one of two categories, solution deepening and market widening. Now, solution deepening means making your product better for its existing users, but not making it available to more users. Whereas market widening means making your product available to more users, but not making the product itself any better."  Tactical:  Identify if a feature is deepening the solution for current users or widening the market for new ones.Communicate 'market widening' work clearly to avoid the perception of slowed product velocity.

You then find your next growth driver or set of drivers."

"As a general rule, as a general principle, I certainly try to make sure that we're always reserving some capacity for bold, audacious experimental research projects. You can think of those really uncertain bets as being five to 10% of the team's capacity. About 25, maybe 30% of the team's capacity should generally be on just operations. How do we keep our in-market products meeting customer expectations? And then the remainder of it, what is that, about 60% or so, is really on incremental progress for our end market products."  Tactical:  Allocate 5-10% of capacity to Horizon 2 and 3 'moonshot' projectsReserve 25-30% of capacity for operational fundamentals and customer expectationsDedicate ~60% of capacity to incremental progress on existing products

"What is our appetite for this? What is the maximum amount of time we’re willing to go before we actually finish something? And we have that startup moment... at least this, if not the whole project, this meaningful piece, we can literally walk away from."  Tactical:  Ask: 'Is this problem worth six weeks of our time?' before deciding how to solve it.Prioritize projects that result in a 'shippable' piece of value that can stand on its own.

And that's actually part of the importance of understanding level one, what your core action is."

"In order to be able to effectively run a high velocity testing program, you need to be able to source ideas from across the company. And that's why I came up with ICE, that if you're having people submit ideas and you can't tell them why their idea was not chosen, they're just going to get upset... But if you have a systematic way of being able to compare ideas, it's more likely that people will be able to get it"  Tactical:  Use ICE to score and compare ideas from different departments.Communicate the reasoning behind prioritization to the broader team to encourage continued idea generation.

"L tasks which are leverage tasks... when you put in a certain amount of effort, you get 10X or 100X in return... neutral tasks (N)... overhead tasks (O)... as a product manager... all your tasks are not created equal, there are actually three type of tasks that you end up doing in such a role."  Tactical:  Identify 'L' tasks (like strategy or difficult PRDs) and allow your inner perfectionist to shine only on those.Use 'placebo productivity' (doing N and O tasks) to build momentum before tackling a scary L task.Change your physical location to force focus when working on high-leverage tasks.    "You should stop doing work that simply provides a positive return on investment, ROI. And you should start focusing on work that minimizes opportunity cost... ROI mindset... end up trying to decrease the denominator... start working on the low hanging fruit. You start prioritizing the quick wins."  Tactical:  Shift from asking 'Is this a good use of my time?' to 'Is this the best use of my time?'Use rough allocation guidance (e.g., 60% Incrementals, 30% Big New Initiatives, 10% Stability) to protect space for non-incremental work.

And then there's some magic threshold where it produces an enormous amount of value and then continued investment doesn't really pay off."

"The other big lesson... it's also very important to know what you're not building. And this one is not only in big companies, I would say even in startups, it's extremely important to know what you're not building because you could very easily get swayed by customer X telling you to do this, customer y telling you to do that. And a product that tries to be all things to all people usually doesn't end up going anywhere."  Tactical:  Clearly define and communicate what the team is NOT building.Resist the urge to accommodate every individual customer request to maintain product focus.

"We took all the churn reasons that our customer success and sales teams had been painstakingly collecting for years, grouped them by category, which was roughly product features we needed to build, sorted descending by ARR, took the top 10 things and made that our roadmap"  Tactical:  Group customer feedback and churn reasons into feature categoriesSort these categories by the total ARR associated with the feedbackFocus the roadmap on the top 10 items to optimize for speed and clarity    "One of the traps with RICE that we observed is that the C and E, the confidence and effort tends to cause you to prematurely deprioritize potentially high reach, high impact bets... ignore the C and E for a little longer than it's comfortable, and just sit with those high reach, high impact ideas with engineers and designers in the room committed to actually trying to solve them."  Tactical:  Temporarily ignore Confidence and Effort scores for high-impact ideasSpend a week with engineering and design to explore high-reach ideas before scoring themLook for high-confidence, lower-effort versions of innovative bets after the initial exploration

So we have higher confidence in the immediate half, lower confidence in the following half, but we just plan every 12 months, every six months because it gives our business more confidence in what's coming and a better opportunity to align our go-to-market and product planning."  Tactical:  Plan for a 12-month horizon but revisit and update the plan every 6 months.Assign higher confidence to the immediate 6-month window and lower confidence to the subsequent 6 months.

And lo and behold, more people published more projects... if you make the whole product about one thing, everyone does that. That core crank operates at 10X the velocity."
