Managing Timelines  Managing timelines is the discipline of translating uncertainty into reliable delivery commitments. The best product teams don't just estimate better—they structure their work to ship early, commit only to what's in their control, and use deadlines strategically to create organizational momentum.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 13 experts.

1 Commit only to the phase you can see clearly  Stop making promises about distant delivery dates when you haven't even scoped the work. Break projects into phases—discovery, solutioning, build, launch—and commit dates only for the immediate phase. Engineering estimates are most accurate after solutioning is complete, not before discovery starts.

Featured guest perspectives

"We've gotten a lot better at making the commitments around the work that's right in front of us versus making a commitment around a project six months out when we haven't even done enough discovery."

— Annie Pearl    "A project's more like a hill. It's not like a linear line. If you're on the left side of the hill, it means you're still pushing this thing up the hill. You're still trying to figure out how to do this. But once work gets to the top, it's downhill from there."

— Jason Fried        2 Ship something functional early, then iterate  The most reliable way to hit deadlines is to invert your approach: get to a shippable state as fast as possible, then spend remaining time polishing. If you have something working at 10% of the timeline, you've bought yourself runway to decide whether to iterate or ship.

Featured guest perspectives

"We do almost no estimating in order to hit deadlines. What we do is we ship as early as we can... if by the time that 10% of the time has elapsed, you have a working thing, you can now spend the rest of the time deciding whether or not you want to do another iteration."

— Nan Yu    "The time to first demo is much shorter, but the time to a full deployment is going to take longer... that inner loop of prototyping and iterating gets shortened. But the bar for scale therefore becomes much higher."

— Aparna Chennapragada        3 Treat real deadlines as P0 with ruthless protection  Deadlines only work if they're treated as the highest priority. When you commit to a date, everything else becomes secondary. This means not having too many deadlines, protecting the team from distractions, and making it crystal clear to stakeholders that you're taking it seriously.

Featured guest perspectives

"The only way to make deadlines real is to take them so seriously that they are basically like a P0 problem, and everything else has to not matter in comparison to the deadline."

— Nan Yu    "The thing about projects is when you run out of time and you run out of money, the project is over. Don't run out of time, don't run out of money. Good intentions are no reason for an extension."

— Seth Godin        4 Challenge estimates from first principles  Timeline padding accumulates at every handoff. Well-intentioned team members add buffers, which compound into bloated estimates. Your job is to dig into the assumptions, separate actual work from protective padding, and work through the reasoning with the team to find realistic commitments.

Featured guest perspectives

"If timelines are maybe not well reasoned through from first principles and perhaps there's padding that has been well intentionally added by different folks, you have to understand fully, okay, what are the assumptions of how long things will actually take and what is padding?"

— Dylan Field    "Tasks take people three times longer to finish than they estimate. Why does that happen? Because when you say, 'Here's that thing on the to-do list,' you work on it for five minutes and then you get an email... you never actually track how long that thing took you to finish."

— Nir Eyal        5 Use manufactured momentum to force progress  Sometimes the best deadline is one you create yourself. Arbitrary launch dates and manufactured milestones force decision-making and prevent the team from over-perfecting. Your job isn't just to maintain momentum—it's to create it when it doesn't exist naturally.

Featured guest perspectives

"Your job is not just to keep people going on momentum. Your job is to make momentum. And sometimes that momentum has to be manufactured... creating manufactured deadlines and launch dates."

— Laura Modi    "I use the reviews of the work every single week. And the reason there's not a lot of bureaucracy... is I'd review the work and if something wasn't happening, then I would stop the meeting and say, 'Why isn't this happening?'"

— Brian Chesky

✗ Common Mistakes

Committing to delivery dates before discovery is complete—you're guessing, not estimatingLetting deadlines proliferate so nothing is truly P0Relying on estimation accuracy instead of shipping early and iteratingAccepting padded timelines without digging into the underlying assumptions     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

You have working software earlier in the timeline than stakeholders expectTeams can clearly articulate what phase they're in and what's committed vs. aspirationalDeadlines are rare but sacred—when you set one, everyone knows it mattersYour estimates get better over time because you track actual vs. predicted duration

"Figure out, maybe the night before, the one thing that you want to get done in your day, and then at the earliest opportunity, just try to give yourself five minutes on it."  Tactical:  Identify your 'one thing' the night before.Use the 'five-minute rule' to lower the mental hurdle of starting a difficult task.

"Something we've done over the last year is really kind of moved to a model of talking about dates and promising and committing to dates that are within our control. And so, if you think about the product development life cycle, we can commit to a discovery effort... we've gotten a lot better at making the commitments around the work that's right in front of us versus making a commitment around a project six months out when we haven't even done enough discovery."  Tactical:  Break the lifecycle into Discovery, Solutioning, Build, and Launch.Only provide engineering delivery dates once the solutioning phase is complete and estimation is accurate.

"What I'm seeing is that the time to first demo is much shorter, but the time to a full deployment is going to take longer. So I think that there's going to be an uneven cadence. So typically, I think there was much more of a you've been this thing, you take a few weeks and then you can iterate and so on. But that inner loop of prototyping and iterating and getting even user research through AI conversations, all of that gets shortened. But I think the bar for scale, therefore becomes much high."  Tactical:  Plan for a shortened 'inner loop' for prototyping and discoveryAllocate significant time for the 'outer loop' of scaling and deploymentManage stakeholder expectations regarding the gap between a successful demo and a shippable product

"I had a head program manager that would score all the projects. Either they're green, yellow, or red. Meaning they're on track or not on track to ship... I use the reviews of the work every single week. And the reason there's not a lot of bureaucracy... is I'd review the work and if something wasn't happening, then I would stop the meeting and say, 'Why isn't this happening?'"  Tactical:  Elevate program management to a high-status roleUse a simple RAG (Red, Amber, Green) status for project trackingReview work weekly to identify and unblock individual engineers

"If timelines are maybe not well reasoned through from first principles and perhaps there's padding that has been well intentionally added by different folks, you have to understand fully, okay, what are the assumptions of how long things will actually take and what is a padding? Then, really work through that with the team."  Tactical:  Ask 'why' to uncover hidden constraints or unnecessary padding in estimatesWork through timeline assumptions from first principles with the team

"When you're building out an SEO effort, and I'm going to keep going back to this, it's a product. So you're building out a product and you're creating milestones... Now, if you start missing all those milestones... you can point very specifically to all those milestones that were missed."  Tactical:  Set monthly milestones for ideation, PRD creation, engineering sprints, and shippingUse 'pages indexed' as an early milestone to validate that the technical build is working

"There's heavy Jira automation... making sure that you have really good process around how are you going to run so many experiments... We're planning months out, as we think about these feature iterations, even small ones, feature iterations, because when you lose cycles, not pushing on a feature, it's just sort of lost opportunity."  Tactical:  Use Jira automation to manage experiment pipelines.Plan design and engineering bandwidth months in advance to ensure continuous iteration.

Jason Fried 1 quote

"We have these things in Basecamp called hill charts. And things that are on, that's actually work... A project's more like a hill. It's not like a linear line. If you're on the left side of the hill, it means you're still pushing this thing up the hill. You're still trying to figure out how to do this. But once work gets to the top, it's downhill from there. It's just pure execution and we know how to nail it."  Tactical:  Visualize work as a hill: the left side is 'figuring it out' and the right side is 'execution'Identify projects stuck on the 'uphill' side as high-risk for missing deadlinesFocus management attention on moving items from the left side of the hill to the top

"Your job is not just to keep people going on momentum. Your job is to make momentum. And sometimes that momentum has to be manufactured. And that has been one of my biggest lessons on just how, as leaders and people starting companies, how do you force yourself? And sometimes when it's early on, you're actually just doing it to yourself, creating manufactured deadlines and launch dates."  Tactical:  Set 'manufactured' deadlines and launch dates to force progress.Use arbitrary milestones to prevent the team from over-perfecting and missing opportunities.

"The only way to make deadlines real is to take them so seriously that they are basically like a P0 problem, and everything else has to not matter in comparison to the deadline because that's the only way you're going to be able to signal to the team and also to all the stakeholders that you're actually taking it seriously."  Tactical:  Don't have too many deadlines; only use them for critical external events.Protect the team from all other distractions once a deadline is set.    "We do almost no estimating in order to hit deadlines. What we do is we ship as early as we can. The thing we talked about earlier where if by the time that 10% of the time has elapsed, you have a working thing, you can now spend the rest of the time deciding whether or not you want to do another iteration or you want to polish that thing."  Tactical:  Focus on getting to a 'yes or no' shippable state as quickly as possible.Commit to the process of fast iteration from the start of the project.

"tasks take people three times longer to finish than they estimate. Why does that happen? Because when you say, 'Okay, here's that thing on the to-do list. I'm going to work on that and see how long it takes me to get it done.' So, you work on it for five minutes and then you get an email and then you get a notification... you never actually track how long that thing took you to finish"  Tactical:  Measure productivity by whether you did what you said you would do for as long as you said you would without distraction.Use time-boxing to create a feedback loop on how long tasks actually take.Switch from a to-do list (output-focused) to a calendar (input-focused) to understand constraints.

"The thing about projects is when you run out of time and you run out of money, the project is over. Don't run out of time, don't run out of money. Good intentions are no reason for an extension. The professional doesn't ask for an extension because the professional understands that things you didn't expect are going to happen."  Tactical:  Treat deadlines and budgets as hard constraints that define the end of the project.Build buffers into plans to handle inevitable unexpected events without asking for extensions.

"We have this calculator that we look at that says, 'How much time are you spending in meetings?'... All right, next quarter, it's red again. All right, now maybe we need to start having the conversation of, what this new hire will take over."  Tactical:  Track meeting time, PTO, and optimization tasks against the total number of days in a quarterCut non-essential meetings or project involvements before approving new headcountWait for two consecutive quarters of 'red' capacity before initiating a hire
