Managing Imposter Syndrome  Imposter syndrome is the persistent feeling that you don't deserve your success and will eventually be exposed as a fraud. Managing it is a distinct professional skill that involves reframing discomfort as growth, practicing vulnerability, and recognizing that these feelings often coincide with the fastest career growth periods.

Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 1 experts.

1 Reframe discomfort as a growth signal  When you feel like an imposter, recognize it as evidence that you're in a stretch role - which is where growth happens fastest. The discomfort isn't a sign you're in the wrong place; it's a sign you're exactly where you need to be to develop new capabilities. Lean into it rather than away from it.

"Being in an uncomfortable situation... coincides with the fastest and most intense periods of growth in one's career."

— Julie Zhuo        2 Practice vulnerability about your doubts  Rather than hiding imposter feelings, selectively share them with trusted colleagues or mentors. You'll often discover they feel the same way. This vulnerability builds connection and normalizes the experience. The people who seem most confident usually just hide their doubts better.

Even highly successful leaders experience it for years - Julie Zhuo experienced it for eight years while rising to VP at Facebook. Knowing this is normal makes it easier to manage the ongoing feelings rather than expecting them to disappear.
