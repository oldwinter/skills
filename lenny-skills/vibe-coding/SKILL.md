Vibe Coding  Vibe coding is a new mode of software development where non-engineers use AI tools to build functional software and prototypes through natural language prompts and iterative feedback. This skill is transforming how PMs, designers, and marketers can contribute to product development without deep technical expertise.

Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 3 experts.

1 Start with functional prototypes, not static mockups  Replace Figma presentations with working prototypes that demonstrate your concept in action. Use AI coding tools to build interactive demos that stakeholders can actually use, rather than clicking through static designs. This creates more realistic feedback loops and accelerates decision-making.

Featured guest perspectives

"Instead of showing stuff in Figma, we should be showing prototypes that people are vibe coding over the course of 30 minutes to illustrate proofs of concept."

— Kevin Weil        2 Build your own tools as you need them  Use vibe coding to create custom internal tools and utilities that solve your specific workflow problems. Rather than waiting for engineering resources, build the animation editor you need, the data dashboard you want, or the automation script that would save you hours. This compounds your productivity over time.

Featured guest perspectives

"They'll vibe code a animation editor and then they use the animation editor to build the animation"

— Alexander Embiricos        3 Add it as a core skill on your resume  Vibe coding is becoming a legitimate professional skill that non-technical roles should actively develop and market. It represents a new capability that goes beyond basic prompt engineering - the ability to ship functional software through AI assistance. Treat it as a skill worth investing in and showcasing.

Featured guest perspectives

"I vibe code myself so I would put that as even as a skill on my resume now."

— Elena Verna

✗ Common Mistakes

Treating vibe coding as just 'better prompt engineering' rather than a distinct development approachSpending too much time making prototypes perfect instead of shipping quickly and iteratingNot learning the basics of code structure, making it harder to debug AI-generated output     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

You can build a working prototype in 30-60 minutes that previously would have required engineering supportYou're creating your own tools to solve workflow problems rather than waiting for someone else to build themStakeholders are engaging with your interactive prototypes rather than asking clarifying questions about static mockups
