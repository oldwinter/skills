Startup Pivoting  Startup pivoting is the skill of recognizing when to change direction and executing that change effectively. Most founders do incremental 10% pivots when they need dramatic 200% pivots. The key is maintaining rational distance from your current approach and honestly assessing whether you've exhausted the possibilities.

Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 2 experts.

1 Ask if you've exhausted the possibilities  The core question when considering a pivot isn't whether things are going well - it's whether you've truly exhausted the possibilities with your current approach. If there are still promising paths unexplored, a pivot might be premature. If you've genuinely tried everything, it's time to change.

Featured guest perspectives

"The decision is about have you exhausted the possibilities?"

— Stewart Butterfield        2 Pivot 200%, not 10%  When founders finally decide to pivot, they often make changes that are too incremental. A tweak to the positioning or a new feature isn't a pivot - it's iteration. True pivots require dramatic change. If you're going to pivot, make it meaningful enough to actually test a new hypothesis.

— Todd Jackson        3 Maintain rational distance from your current approach  Founders get emotionally attached to their current product and approach, which clouds judgment about when to pivot. Cultivate rational distance - the ability to evaluate your startup as an outsider would. This emotional separation is essential for making clear-headed pivot decisions.
