Working Backwards  Working backwards is a powerful planning methodology that starts with the ideal customer outcome and reverse-engineers the steps to get there. Popularized by Amazon's PR/FAQ process, it forces clarity on what you're building and why before any code is written. The discipline of articulating the future state first prevents the common trap of building solutions in search of problems.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 12 experts.

1 Start with the customer need, not your capabilities  Begin every decision by asking what's best for the customer. Ignore initial financial or resource constraints to first define the ideal customer solution. Only after you've defined what customers truly need should you work backward to determine what you need to build. Trust that business results will follow customer satisfaction.

Featured guest perspectives

"Jeff would say, we took it as an article of faith. If we served customers well, if we prioritized customers and delivered for them, things like sales, things like revenue and active customers and things like the share price and free cash flow would follow. So therefore, when we're making a decision thinking about a problem, we're going to start with what's best for the customer and then come backward from there."

— Bill Carr    "Working backwards is all about the problem and starting there and obsessing about the problem and being guided by it to then go into the solution. So when teams that do it wrong is they don't do that. They don't work backwards. They have something they want to build... And if you say we could and it's not grounded in a customer or customer's problem, you're not working backwards."

— Ian McAllister        2 Write the press release before building anything  Draft a mock press release describing your product as if it's launching today. Include the customer problem, the solution, a customer quote, and a call to action. This forces extreme clarity on the value proposition before development begins. If the press release doesn't 'jump off the page' with something customers will really need, rethink the product.

Featured guest perspectives

"Whenever we're devising a new product or feature, we're going to start by writing a press release describing the feature and describing it in a way that speaks to the customer and to some degree the external press and world where the idea is, in my description of this, it better jump off the page of something like, wow, as a customer I will really need this."

— Bill Carr    "Amazon has this great process where the PMs have to write a press release for the finished product even before they start building the product. That's the first thing that they have to do is to write that press release like the product is about to launch today. What are you telling the users about that product?"

— Shweta Shriva        3 Use FAQs to prove you have a legitimate plan  The FAQ section of the PR/FAQ document is where you address the hard questions. How will you build this? What are the technical hurdles? What will it cost? Who might oppose it internally? The FAQ forces you to think through the 'elephant in the room' questions and prove there's a viable path to execution, not just a compelling vision.

Featured guest perspectives

"One, is it a big idea? And then second, is it something we should be doing?... And the third test, is there a legitimate plan to succeed? And you got to have all three of those things. And I think the FAQ part of the working backwards process is that early stage legitimate test of whether this thing has a plan."

— Ian McAllister    "The working backwards process uses a mock press release to force extreme clarity on the product's value proposition before development begins... Include internal FAQs to de-risk the launch and address 'the elephant in the room.'"

— Jason Shah        4 Define the theoretical ideal, then work backward  For breakthrough innovation, define the 'theoretical minimum' or ideal state first. What would the best possible version look like if there were no constraints? What's the theoretical minimum cost or maximum speed? Then plan on a multi-year horizon to solve the systemic issues required to reach that ideal.

Featured guest perspectives

"Instead of incrementally going, doing a jump to make it a little better, a little better, a little better, you can never get there. How do we take two years, and end up there? ... What is the theoretical minimum cost for moving money into a market? What is the theoretical maximum speed?"

— Nilan Peiris    "So column A is the traditional just work from today's world. Column B is work from this dream reality and work backwards from how to achieve that."

— Melanie Perkins        5 Visualize the future state vividly  Don't just write about the future - visualize it in detail. Imagine yourself there. Engage all your senses. What does success look like? Feel like? Once you have something exciting, go back to the beginning and map the journey required to get there. This backcasting approach unshackles you from the constraints of the present.

Featured guest perspectives

"Start with the ending. Come up with how you want things to turn out, and then work your way back. And start as far out as you want... imagine you're there. Engage all your senses... And then if you've got something exciting, go back to the beginning and then imagine how you got there and just write that journey out."

— Donna Lichaw    "He calls it backcasting as distinct from forecasting. ... standing in that future, five years out, looking back to the present, what did we do to make this different future happen? That's category design. That's how you unshackle yourself from the past."

— Christopher Lochhead        6 Align the entire organization to the launch date  Working backwards isn't just about writing a customer quote. It's about aligning the entire organizational machinery toward a specific launch date. Identify stakeholders who might derail the project. Define what GTM, marketing, legal, and compliance need to be ready. Use the PR/FAQ to create organizational alignment, not just product clarity.

Featured guest perspectives

"Essentially what you're working backwards from is an entire machinery at a particular day that is working for... For the date of GTM, what do we need to do from here till that particular day so that the GTM is successful, but also, what will be the machinery we would have created so that this product is successful?"

— Anuj Rathi    "How do I imagine the company and the product is going to be different and better for our customers in a quarter from now? And from that, walk it backwards."

— Daniel Lereya

✗ Common Mistakes

Writing a PR/FAQ to justify something you already want to build rather than starting with genuine customer needFocusing only on the press release while skipping the FAQ section that proves viabilityWorking backwards from today's capabilities rather than from the ideal customer outcomeTreating the PR/FAQ as a one-time exercise rather than iterating until the value proposition is genuinely compellingIgnoring organizational alignment - the PR/FAQ should surface stakeholder concerns early     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Your press release genuinely excites customers and colleagues who read itThe FAQ section surfaces hard questions that get addressed before development startsYou can articulate the ideal customer outcome before discussing implementation detailsCross-functional teams are aligned on the launch date and their respective responsibilitiesProducts that make it through the PR/FAQ process have a higher success rate than those that don't

"Essentially what you're working backwards from is an entire machinery at a particular day that is working for... For the date of GTM, what do we need to do from here till that particular day so that the GTM is successful, but also, what will be the machinery we would have created so that this product is successful?"  Tactical:  Use the PRFAQ to identify potential internal alliances or stakeholders who might derail the project.Write three divergent and fully thought-through press releases to help leadership compare alternative routes.Include mandatory FAQs for specific organizational needs like compliance, legal, or marketplace impact.

Tactical:  Start every decision by asking what is best for the customerWork backward from the ideal customer solution to determine the necessary engineering and resource requirements    "The principle states something along the lines of that great leaders start with the customer's needs and work backwards from there to sort of meet those needs or solve them. Then also because we created a process in this window I was talking about earlier, the 2004 to 2007 window, we created this process for new product innovation called the Working Backwards PR/FAQ process."  Tactical:  Ignore initial financial or resource constraints to first define the ideal customer solutionUse the PR/FAQ process to codify the working backwards approach

That's category design. That's how you unshackle yourself from the past."  Tactical:  Envision your company five years in the future and work backward to determine the steps needed to get there.Reject the premise of how things are currently done to open up new possibilities.

And if you say we could and it's not grounded in a customer or customer's problem, you're not working backwards."

That's what you write. And then you write the solution paragraph and then the customer quote. And then the fact which is is there a legitimate plan to succeed?"  Tactical:  Write a problem paragraph, a solution paragraph, and a customer quoteUse the FAQ to detail the internal components, finances, and technical hurdles    "One, is it a big idea? And then second, is it something we should be doing?... And the third test, is there a legitimate plan to succeed? And you got to have all three of those things. And I think the FAQ part of the working backwards process is that early stage legitimate test of whether this thing has a plan."

"Amazon is well-known for is the working backwards process, and for those that don't know, the idea is try to define effectively an ideal end state... and usually the mechanism for doing this is what's called a PRFAQ, and that's a press release and frequently asked questions, and it forces a certain degree of clarity to have to actually write a press release about the product that you're going to eventually launch."  Tactical:  Write a press release including an introduction, problem statement, solution, customer quote, leadership quote, and call to action.Include internal FAQs to de-risk the launch and address 'the elephant in the room'.

"Work backwards from your end state. Almost think of career as a product. So if you're building a good product, you think about, 'Well, here's what a great product would look like,' and then you break it into version one, version two, version three."  Tactical:  Define your ultimate career end-state firstBreak the journey into 'versioned' roles that build toward that end-state

What is the theoretical minimum cost for moving money into a market? What is the theoretical maximum speed? Not just make it instant, make it cheap, but what actually is the lowest it could possibly be?"  Tactical:  Define the 'theoretical minimum' or 'ideal state' for your core value propositionPlan on a multi-year horizon to solve systemic issues rather than seeking incremental quarterly gainsAsk what the 'best it could possibly be' looks like and work backwards from that point

"What we found was that six weeks is the maximum that we can see into the future where we could actually say, 'How do we work backward and figure out something we could build in that six weeks and really land it?'"  Tactical:  Use the time box as a creative constraint to force simpler, more elegant solutions.Identify the 'end state' of the six-week cycle and map the necessary steps to reach it.
