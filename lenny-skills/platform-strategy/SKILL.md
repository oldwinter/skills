Platform Strategy  Platform strategy is about building a foundation that others can build on. The best platforms create more value in their ecosystem than in their core product. They enable developers and partners to solve problems the platform owner never anticipated while accumulating data and network effects that make the platform increasingly defensible.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 24 experts.

1 Start with hard APIs and clear interfaces  You can't have a platform without boundaries. Force every internal capability to be exposed through structured, documented APIs. This creates the discipline necessary for external developers and enables future opportunities you can't predict. The internal pain of hard APIs is what enabled AWS.

Featured guest perspectives

"If you don't create hard APIs to your technology, you're out... because he forced it so hard, they were the ones who did Amazon Web Services because they had such hard defined APIs."

— Gustav Söderström    "Once we moved to a service-based architecture, and then teams could own their code with defined endpoints, APIs that other teams could understand that are well-documented, then we could move in that direction."

— Bill Carr        2 Let the ecosystem make more money than you  A true platform is defined by third-party success. If your developers can't build sustainable businesses on top of you, you don't have a platform—you have a feature. Commit to not 'pulling the rug' on successful partners. The ecosystem's success compounds your own.

Featured guest perspectives

"A true platform is when your ecosystem makes more money than the core does. And so many times... companies build on it and then they get the rug pulled out from under them because they're too successful."

— Matt Mullenweg    "They all establish a third-party platform that has some incentives built in... Be aware that platforms often absorb the highest-value use cases into first-party features once they reach scale."

— Brian Balfour        3 Understand the platform lifecycle  Platforms follow predictable stages: moat building, opening to developers, then closing for monetization. If you're building on someone else's platform, understand which stage they're in. If you're building a platform, plan your transitions deliberately rather than reacting to market pressure.

Featured guest perspectives

"The four steps are: Step Zero is conditions of the market have been met. Step One is about a moat, Step Two is about a platform opening, and Step Three is about the platform closing for control and monetization."

— Brian Balfour    "Anything that is shaped like an ecosystem that has some kind of network effect... you have to know what you're looking for and find the dynamics of a thing that if it worked would work at an accelerating rate."

— Alex Komoroske        4 Solve the problem first, platformize later  Don't build platform infrastructure before you have users. Hack solutions, validate with customers, iterate on the product—then abstract the patterns into a platform. Simultaneous product-building and platform-building is a recipe for slow, over-engineered failure.

Featured guest perspectives

"I would go, okay, we need to win the problem space first, and if the platform is there, let's use it. If it's not there, we'll hack it, test it, iterate on it with customers, and then whatever is good there, let's platformize it later."

— Tanguy Crusson    "A lot of the best platform type offerings in companies start in individual application teams. An application team has a problem and they solve it for themselves and it turns out that that's actually a really good idea."

— Camille Fournier        5 Harvest successful patterns from your users  The best platform features come from observing what developers build on top of you. When you see multiple teams solving the same problem, that's a signal to promote that solution into the platform. Assimilate and stabilize rather than inventing in isolation.

Featured guest perspectives

"A good platform team is often looking around for those and then sort of taking them and then assimilating them... focus on 'stabilizing and scaling' existing solutions rather than just 'zero-to-one' building."

— Camille Fournier    "How long would it take to build a platform layer, which exposes APIs so anyone could build NFT gating in one hour? If you put the gas in the tank, people could drive on that gas for a long time going forward."

— Farhan Thawar

✗ Common Mistakes

Building platform infrastructure before validating the core productCreating implicit dependencies that break when partners scaleAbsorbing successful third-party use cases into first-party features without warningTreating platform engineering as infrastructure rather than a product with usersOpening the platform before having a defensible moat     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Third-party developers are building things on your platform you never anticipatedYour ecosystem's combined revenue exceeds your first-party product revenuePartners describe your APIs as stable and well-documentedYou can point to specific platform features that originated from user patternsDevelopers actively choose your platform over alternatives for strategic reasons

"Anything that is shaped like an ecosystem that has some kind of network effect... you have to know what you're looking for and find the dynamics of a thing that if it worked would work at an accelerating rate. Lots and lots and lots of things intrinsically have this shape."  Tactical:  Look for 'truffles'—dynamics where the value increases with the number of participants.Invest incrementally in ecosystem projects only as you receive signals of utility and adoption.

"The way I think about how we are positioned and what we do with GitHub is... So it's a system, not just a product or a set of features... you need to have a system. You need to have kind of the ability, an entire Swiss Army toolkit, not just the autocomplete, not just a chat, not just like a software agent that runs and you kind of hand hold. You need all of this to work together."  Tactical:  Build systems that capture user context and repositories to create defensibilityFocus on the 'Swiss Army toolkit' approach for complex professional workflowsIntegrate multiple AI capabilities (autocomplete, chat, agents) into a unified system

"Provide guardrails for what a good experience is in your marketplace, set a clear bar for quality, and provide the right coaching and tools for supply to be successful, and then take a step back and see where the gaps are and invest more in hands-on tactics just to close those gaps more specifically."  Tactical:  Set a clear quality bar and provide coaching tools for those who fall below it.Use 'hands-on' tactics (like managed services) only to close specific gaps that market forces can't solve.

"Once we moved to a service-based architecture, and then teams could own their code with defined endpoints, APIs that other teams could understand that are well-documented, then we could move in that direction."  Tactical:  Move from monolithic codebases to service-based architecturesEnsure all internal services have defined, documented endpoints/APIs

Brandon Chu 1 quote

"The cycles for platform work are five to 10 odd times longer. You're maybe changing something on the infrastructure level, then opening up an API and then doing an alpha period for the API where developers now build on that and test things. And then you move into a beta. And then finally, two years later, some end customer actually uses that app"  Tactical:  Define clear principles and a 'stack rank' of constituents (e.g., merchant vs. developer) to guide policy decisionsDesign a 'canvas' for others to build on rather than a specific end-user experienceCelebrate intermediate milestones like API alphas to maintain team motivation during long cycles

"The four steps are essentially, one is I call a Step Zero. It's the conditions of the market have been met. Step One is about a moat, Step Two is about a platform opening, and Step Three is about the platform closing for control and monetization."  Tactical:  Identify the moat that creates defensibility for the platform owner.Establish a third-party platform with clear incentives for developers.Anticipate the closing stage where the platform prioritizes its own monetization and first-party applications.    "Step One is then these players, somebody essentially identifies whatever the moat is, the thing that is going to help build them defensibility and help them hit escape velocity... That typically comes down to third-party content creators or app developers and other businesses. So they all establish a third-party platform that has some incentives built in."  Tactical:  Look for the 'value exchange' where a platform offers distribution in return for your application's engagement and data.Be aware that platforms often absorb the highest-value use cases into first-party features once they reach scale.

Camille Hearst 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I think it was probably predictable to some degree that platforms would win because just of the nature of aggregation. Once you have either all of the supply or you've aggregated the demand, it's really a strong network effect. Why investors love to invest in these types of businesses, it's hard to break out."  Tactical:  Focus on aggregating either the total supply or the total demand to build a defensible network effect

"Platform engineering is not just maintaining cloud infrastructure... platforms are products, ultimately. You should be thinking about how do I create coherent offerings that make this company more productive?"  Tactical:  Hire product managers for internal platform teamsFocus on outcome-based metrics like reducing cycle time or solving scaling bottlenecks    "I think it gets to be like, you have 50 plus engineers. I don't think this is the kind of thing that you start when you are 10 engineers... when you hit either a lot of inefficiency where you're seeing the same people across a bunch of different teams... dealing with this instead of centralizing it."  Tactical:  Look for signs of redundant problem-solving across different product teams as a trigger for centralizationAvoid building a platform team too early (e.g., at 10 engineers)    "A lot of the best platform type offerings in companies start in individual application teams. An application team has a problem and they solve it for themselves and it turns out that that's actually a really good idea... So a good platform team is often looking around for those and then sort of taking them and then assimilating them."  Tactical:  Identify successful ad-hoc tools built by product teams and stabilize them for company-wide useFocus on 'stabilizing and scaling' existing solutions rather than just 'zero-to-one' building

"What data network effects are, is leveraging product usage data to make the product value stronger and stronger over time... your product being able to generate its own data, versus just relying on the big platforms to do all the work for you. That's a real edge."  Tactical:  Leverage product usage data to create personalized results or better targeting for usersFocus on generating internal data to mitigate the impact of external platform changes

"We believe in the power of open source and one of our core missions is to increase openness, and that means contributing to open protocols and contributing to open source. ... We want to build things that not only are good for us and our customers, but that outlast Block and outgrow Block."  Tactical:  Default to open-sourcing internal tools that solve general-purpose problemsBuild on open protocols to ensure long-term extensibility and avoid vendor lock-in

"Another thing here is what I mentioned previously is us investing heavily into platform so that every solution is scalable from the get go so that we don't have any custom solutions. For example, take our credit team, they ship new products like loans or credit cards in the country literally every month. And it is just maybe 300 people."  Tactical:  Avoid custom, one-off solutions in favor of scalable platform componentsBuild platforms that allow lean teams to multiply their output across many markets

"If you don't create hard APIs to your technology, you're out. And if you think about it, it has to be that way because otherwise no one would do it... because he forced it so hard, they were the ones who did Amazon Web Services because they had such hard defined APIs."  Tactical:  Mandate that all internal technology be exposed via structured, maintainable APIsUse hard APIs to allow internal teams to compete or collaborate without needing deep code access

"The more you can bake into a clear platform, it reduces the decision-making complexity for everyone who's working on the domain part of the problem."  Tactical:  Invest in systems thinking to create a platform that simplifies the space for domain-specific workIterate on the platform based on product needs rather than building it in a vacuum    "The idea of a compound startup for us is that we're basically a lot of businesses that all work together... all of these different businesses benefit from being built on top of one platform."  Tactical:  Start with a single system of record to avoid data replication and sync issuesBuild shared horizontal capabilities like workflow, reporting, and permissioning that all products can use

"We think about dbt open source. It's really the guts of the data transformation... on the cloud side we build proprietary software that supercharges the development life cycle and the productionization of dbt at scale. So what we think about as leaving for our cloud offering is we deal with state, so stateful interactions and also any cross team or structural collaboration."  Tactical:  Keep the core 'guts' of the product open source to reduce friction and build an ecosystem.Reserve stateful interactions and cross-team collaboration features for the proprietary/paid offering.

Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter 1 quote      "The code that decides what notes share has to be out in the open. All of the data and ratings that make it happen have to be out in the open. People should be able to take the code and data and replicate the whole service..."  Tactical:  Publish core algorithms and underlying data to GitHub/public repositories for external auditingEnsure public code is 'runnable' by external parties to allow for true replication

"What's been most exciting to me, actually, is the non-developer persona is now empowered to go and solve these really, really, really more challenging problems by giving the model enough context on what that problem is to be able to solve it."  Tactical:  Leverage built-in tools like Code Interpreter and Browsing to add functionality without writing code.Use third-party integrations (like Zapier) to connect GPTs to external APIs like Notion or Gmail.

"You better go build an application economy... I think he wants me to build an app store. At that moment, I went to the domain registry, and I bought appstore.com. Then, I started working on it at Salesforce so that we would have the ability with our platform to build apps, and then sell them, and that you could do all these things."  Tactical:  Build capabilities for third-party developers to create and sell appsSecure relevant trademarks and domains (like App Store) early to define the categoryFocus on an 'exchange' model where users share capabilities

"And a true platform, it's when your ecosystem makes more money than the core does. And so many times, whether it was the Facebook platform, I'm putting that in air quotes, or the Shopify platform, companies build on it and then they get the rug pulled out from under them because they're too successful."  Tactical:  Measure platform success by the revenue generated by the third-party ecosystemEnsure long-term API stability and fair terms to prevent ecosystem 'rug pulls'

"MCP really tried to tackle that middle one [context and memory]... what if we made this a protocol and what if we made this something that was repeatable? ... I hope that's where we had, and I hope that's where more things had, which is to really have agency and have these agentic use cases."  Tactical:  Expose internal product primitives as scriptable/composable elements via a standard protocol.Focus on 'commoditizing your complements' by making it easy for others to build integrations that work across multiple models.

"I also would love it if you could start a business on ChatGPT. I think there really is a world where, as this thing hits a billion user scale, it can get you distribution, it can get you started on making something in the same way that people built on the internet"  Tactical:  Develop mechanisms (like GPTs) that allow users to package specialized AI capabilitiesFocus on providing distribution and tools that allow for differentiated 'app-like' experiences

Nilan Peiris 1 quote

"we have a single global tech stack, and we have deep local infrastructure. ... you end up with a global product team that owns overall KPIs around conversion rate, et cetera. And you have local, regional teams that own the conversion rate, and the cost to do KYC for their market, and they contribute to the global product code base. So we have weak product ownership, where anyone can make code change, and pull requests, and these guys owning the vision in the center."  Tactical:  Maintain a single global tech stack to avoid fragmented regional versions of the productImplement a 'weak ownership' model where regional teams can submit pull requests to global product codeStructure teams so global leads own the core vision while regional teams own local conversion and compliance KPIs

If it's not there, we'll hack it, test it, iterate on it with customers, and then whatever is good there, let's platformize it later. But that's where you see what makes us super powerful as a bigger company, can also slow us down and make us focus on the wrong assumptions."  Tactical:  Hack solutions initially to validate the concept before committing to long-term platform architectureAvoid simultaneous product-building and platform-building to reduce execution risk

"on any new computer... the developer platform itself is much more interesting and lucrative and world changing than the first-party computer itself...
