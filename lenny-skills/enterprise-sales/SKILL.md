Enterprise Sales  Enterprise sales requires a fundamentally different approach than SMB or mid-market—longer cycles, more stakeholders, and higher stakes on both sides. Success comes from understanding the enterprise buying process, building relationships with champions and decision-makers, and navigating complex organizational dynamics.

Read Guide

The Guide  4 key steps synthesized from 9 experts.

1 Identify and develop an internal champion  Enterprise deals are won or lost based on having an internal advocate who will sell on your behalf when you're not in the room. Find someone whose career success is tied to your product's success, arm them with materials to persuade others, and treat them as a partner in the deal.

Featured guest perspectives

"Every enterprise deal needs a champion... someone inside who will fight for you when you're not there."

— Jason Lemkin    "Your champion's career has to be on the line... they need to personally win if you win."

— Tae Hea Nahm        2 Map the decision-making process and all stakeholders  Enterprise purchases involve multiple stakeholders with different concerns—end users, IT, security, legal, procurement, and executives. Map who influences the decision, who can veto it, and who signs the check. Then address each stakeholder's specific concerns directly.

Featured guest perspectives

"You need to understand the entire decision chain... one stakeholder with concerns can kill a deal even if everyone else is aligned."

— Frank Slootman    "Enterprise sales is multi-threaded... you can't rely on a single relationship to close the deal."

— Jason Lemkin        3 Sell to the business outcome, not the feature set  Enterprise buyers care about business impact—revenue growth, cost reduction, risk mitigation. Frame your entire sales conversation around the outcomes they're trying to achieve and the metrics they're measured on. Features are proof points, not the main event.

Featured guest perspectives

"Enterprises buy outcomes, not products... everything should connect to their business objectives."

— Frank Slootman        4 Prepare for and navigate procurement with patience  Enterprise procurement processes can add months to deals and introduce new obstacles late in the cycle. Understand procurement timelines upfront, get legal and security questionnaires early, and maintain relationship momentum even during slow bureaucratic phases.

Featured guest perspectives

"Procurement is where enterprise deals go to die... anticipate it, prepare for it, and don't lose momentum during it."

— Sarah Tavel

✗ Common Mistakes

"I think it does really play well in this enterprise sales context because also we have a group buyer there. So it's not just one person who's doing some research. This whole group has to have a uniting story."  Tactical:  Use a strategic narrative to provide 'air cover' for sales teams in complex deals.

"typically we have between five and seven people are involved in what we call making the decision for what gets bought. ... So by far the most important persona that matters is that one. We call this the champion in the account because this person, their job is to get consensus and champion the deal across everybody, including their boss, who's the actual economic buyer, the person that writes the check."  Tactical:  Identify the 'champion' who will drive consensus internallyArm the champion with materials to sell to IT, Legal, and the Economic Buyer    "In B2B, typical purchase process, we have five to seven people involved in making the deal happen... it is on you to arm that champion to handle all the objections potentially of all the other groups."  Tactical:  Identify the 'champion' who is tasked with the research and shortlisting.Provide the champion with specific collateral for other departments (e.g., SOC 2 compliance for IT, ROI calculators for the boss).Anticipate common objections from purchasing or security based on previous deals and address them proactively.

"Microsoft was like, "Wait a minute. We need to organize this. We need security. We need account management. We need procurement involved."... they wanted us to have this enterprise product, because they had these requirements and they wanted to have a better control over it, because it was just popping up within the organization without their control."  Tactical:  Use organic adoption 'clusters' as the lead-in for enterprise conversationsFocus enterprise product features on administrative control, security, and procurement requirements

"Product-led sales converts the usage that you've generated via self-serve into a sales opportunity and it attaches a salesperson to close a much larger contract, which can be 15, 20, a hundred thousand dollars in order to bring an enterprise-level solution to a company that has already been using it in a self-serve manner."  Tactical:  Identify the 'escalator' from an individual use case to an enterprise-level solutionUse sales to tell the story of organizational value that the product alone may fail to communicate    "90% of product-led sales is converting the usage into an opportunity by finding a buyer outside, by finding the decision-maker outside. This is where marketing and sales are so crucial in the process. Connecting that decision-maker to the usage and then driving an opportunity through sales funnel all the way to closed one deal."  Tactical:  Differentiate between Product Qualified Accounts (PQA) and Product Qualified Leads (PQL)Use marketing to bring in MQLs (Marketing Qualified Leads) to connect with active PQAs    "One of the most important things is to create network effects within the company... any new sign-up that happens from the company that already has an account in my system should be presented with an option to join that account, not just create a brand new account."  Tactical:  Implement 'push' and 'pull' mechanisms to get users into shared company accountsLook for a 'magic number' of users (often 7+) as a signal for enterprise readiness

"When you get to procurement, you're going to have to do all the work. Make their job easy. ... Give me the forms that you need to fill out. I'll fill them out for you, and you can do it yourself."  Tactical:  Proactively offer to fill out procurement forms for the buyer.Differentiate clearly from 'preferred vendors' to avoid being told to use an existing solution.Truncate contracts into separate service and technology agreements to bypass IT due diligence backups.    "Know who the signature is, because if they don't know what they're looking at, they're going to kick it out and you're going to lose your queue spot."  Tactical:  Ask the procurement lead exactly who the signatory is and what they care about.Provide the buyer with a few bullet points specifically designed for the signatory to explain the value.    "I say the mid-market doesn't exist because what is a mid-market hire? It's either low end enterprise or upper end SMB, and if you bleed those two games you're going to lose. They're so distinctly different."  Tactical:  Define whether you are targeting the upper end of SMB or the lower end of Enterprise.Avoid hybrid sales approaches that attempt to bridge SMB and Enterprise tactics.    "Early adopters are those logos because they have to continue to stay at the number one spot. So they'll take tons of swings to continue to stay in the ... Staying in the number one spot is the hardest part. So those number one logos are like if you can give me just a slight bit of alpha, just a tiny bit, that's where I get promoted, that's where I get the pat on the back because we are the world's leader in our industry and we cannot be disrupted there."  Tactical:  Target industry leaders (e.g., Walmart, McDonald's) early to gain massive proof of concept.Pitch 'alpha' or a competitive edge that helps the executive maintain their market-leading position.    "It's more of an art. It's all about deal crafting. It is a relationship you're building with someone. If they know they can call on you, people will turn over rocks for you."  Tactical:  Build direct relationships that allow for communication via text rather than just email.Co-author the deal structure with the client to ensure it's a 'win' they can defend internally.    "If they have a very immature way of understanding the problem or they've never purchased technology to solve it to some extent... selling them as service, even though the technology is powering it on the backend is the fastest way to get your foot in the door."  Tactical:  Bundle technology with services to reach a higher ACV (75K-150K).Use software to power the service behind the scenes to prove value before upselling the platform.

"The POC should be framed as the entire goal of the POC is to create a business case, period, full stop. It is not to demonstrate product functionality fit within your customer environment's ability to integrate. All of that stuff is a consequence of the business case."  Tactical:  Frame POCs as a 30-day pilot for co-creating an ROI modelCharge for POCs to qualify leads and ensure buyer seriousness    "The right way to think about an ROI model is to actually co-create it with your customers from day one, which means agree and validate on the assumptions and the inputs... If you have done that process and the customer agrees on all the inputs, they're very unlikely to push back on the output of an ROI model."  Tactical:  Co-create ROI models by asking customers for inputs like current process time and headcountFocus on three ROI buckets: incremental gains, cost savings, and opportunity costs

"Outlook users are also used to certain safeguards, like if you've used Outlook in an enterprise, warnings when a recipient is external to your domain or what Outlook users might know as sensitivity labels... it truly is a multi-threaded sale with multiple stakeholders."  Tactical:  Build support for enterprise standards like Microsoft Intune for mobile management.Implement features specifically for IT/Admin stakeholders, such as sensitivity labels and external recipient indicators.

"Forward-deployed engineering, which on some level is kind of a rebrand of professional services but kind of not. And a big part of that is, hey, how do I actually get into your environment, ride alongside you better understand what you're trying to do and then help you actually bring the technology to life and learn a lot along the way."  Tactical:  Use forward-deployed engineers to ride alongside customers and identify generalizable product needs.    "What we started to do at Stripe was that first session was a whiteboarding session, and we would actually get together and have you draw your architecture for payments and all the other things that were under the hood to enable you to take money and drive customer outcomes. And through that we would learn a ton about what was in your stack... But the customer also learned a lot themselves because in many cases they'd never drawn their architecture diagram."  Tactical:  Replace standard discovery calls with collaborative whiteboarding sessions to map customer architecture.

"our analysis showed that anywhere between 40 and 60% of the average salesperson's qualified pipelines... will be ultimately marked as closed loss, no decision."  Tactical:  Recognize that 40-60% of deals in the pipeline may evaporate due to customer ghosting or inaction.    "The omission bias is, if you get down to it, is the fact that people don't want to be blamed for making decisions that lead to a loss... people are okay with missing out. They are not okay with messing up and being blamed"  Tactical:  Address the 'Fear of Messing Up' (FOMU) rather than just dialing up the 'Fear of Missing Out' (FOMO).Focus on instilling confidence that the customer will look like a hero, not a fool.    "The first thing is we've got to judge their level of indecision... The second thing is we've got to offer a recommendation. The third thing is we've got to get them to start trusting us and we call it limit the exploration, and the T is we've got to de-risk the deal."  Tactical:  Judge the level of indecision to determine the specific blocker.Offer a firm recommendation to share the burden of the decision.Limit exploration by building trust and demonstrating expertise.De-risk the deal by creating safety nets and setting realistic expectations.    "We found a technique... called pings and echoes that high performers use... a salesperson will try to articulate but in a non, not to out the customer, but to get confirmation or refutation, if you will, that what they've articulated is actually a concern for their buyer."  Tactical:  Use phrases like 'At this point, most customers like you are worried about X' to see if the customer 'echoes' that concern.Frame the ping as a way to be of service rather than a direct interrogation.    "you've got to shift your posture from asking the customer what they want and just diagnosing their needs, to actually recommending to them what they should do."  Tactical:  Narrow down choices to a manageable set (e.g., three options).Explicitly recommend a specific path (e.g., 'I would go with the middle one') to reduce the buyer's personal risk.    "The first one is you've got to establish some trust... they are brutally transparent with customers about like, 'Hey, I know you were interested in this capability. I got to be honest, we get mixed reviews on that.'"  Tactical:  Be honest about features that are 'early' or 'have kinks'.Admit when a competitor is better suited for a specific use case to build long-term credibility.    "What great salespeople do though is they know that while they'll stand by those claims... they try to kind of under-promise and over-deliver... 'What I'd rather we do is build your business case around a 5X improvement... Then, let's set up to over-deliver against that'"  Tactical:  Build business cases around conservative, 100% achievable numbers rather than best-case scenarios.Position professional services or implementation support as an 'insurance policy' against failure.
