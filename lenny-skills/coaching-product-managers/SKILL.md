Coaching Product Managers  Coaching product managers is the primary responsibility of product leaders at top companies. Rather than managing through process or deliverables, great product leaders develop their PMs through deliberate coaching - diagnosing skill gaps, creating development plans, and providing ongoing feedback. This is the only effective way to scale a product organization.

Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 3 experts.

1 Define what 'good' looks like in your context  Before you can develop PMs, you need a clear definition of what a successful PM looks like in your specific organization. This isn't a generic job description - it's a detailed competency model that reflects your company's stage, market, and culture. Without this foundation, coaching becomes arbitrary.

Featured guest perspectives

"Step number one is really having a solid definition of what a good product person looks like in your context."

— Petra Wille        2 Use frameworks to diagnose skill levels  Apply educational frameworks like Bloom's Taxonomy to understand where each PM is in their development. Are they at the knowledge level, just learning concepts? Comprehension, where they understand why? Or higher levels like application, analysis, and synthesis? This diagnosis guides your coaching approach.

Featured guest perspectives

"Bloom Taxonomy describes what's the different levels or order of critical thinking you need in order to be a master of something... knowledge, and then it's comprehension, and then application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation."

— Bangaly Kaba        3 Make coaching your primary job  The best product leaders at companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft treat coaching as their number one responsibility - not strategy, not execution, but developing their people. This is how you scale a product organization: by creating more great PMs rather than trying to do everything yourself.

Featured guest perspectives

"Sundar at Google has been saying that the number one thing they look for in their leaders is a good coach."

— Marty Cagan

✗ Common Mistakes

Managing through process and deliverables instead of developing peopleApplying a one-size-fits-all approach without assessing individual skill levelsDefining 'good PM' generically rather than contextually for your organizationTreating coaching as something you do when you have time, rather than your primary job     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Your PMs are growing faster than the industry average and getting promotedYou can articulate exactly where each PM is in their development and what they need nextPMs seek you out for coaching rather than avoiding difficult feedback conversationsYour team's output scales as you hire, rather than bottlenecking on your personal capacity
