Giving Presentations  Presentations are how ideas spread and careers advance—yet most presentations are forgettable because they prioritize information transfer over persuasion and emotional connection. The best presenters structure for impact, connect with their audience, and practice relentlessly.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 19 experts.

1 Start with the audience and what you want them to do  Before creating slides, clarify: Who is in the room? What do they currently believe? What do you want them to believe or do after? Every presentation should change something—an opinion, a decision, an action. Design backward from that desired change.

Featured guest perspectives

"Great presentations move people to action... start with what you want the audience to do differently, then build your story around that."

— Nancy Duarte    "A good pitch has a point of view... you're not just sharing information, you're trying to shift how people see the world."

— April Dunford        2 Structure for emotional resonance, not just logic  Facts don't change minds—stories do. Structure your presentation with contrast (current state vs. future state), tension (problems that need solving), and resolution (how you make it possible). Make the audience feel the problem before presenting the solution.

Featured guest perspectives

"The audience needs to feel the gap between what is and what could be... that's what creates the desire for your solution."

— Nancy Duarte    "Every great story has stakes... the audience needs to feel that something important hangs in the balance."

— Matthew Dicks        3 Simplify ruthlessly—one idea per slide  Dense slides compete with your voice for attention. Each slide should reinforce one point with minimal text. If people are reading, they're not listening. Use visuals to create emotional impact, not to serve as your speaker notes.

Featured guest perspectives

"Slides should be a visual aid, not a document... if your audience is reading, they're not listening to you."

— Nancy Duarte    "Less on the slide means more attention on you... and you're more persuasive than any slide."

— Tristan de Montebello        4 Practice out loud until it feels natural  The best presentations look effortless because of extensive practice. Rehearse out loud, not just in your head. Practice with a timer, record yourself, and get feedback. The goal isn't memorization—it's knowing your material so well that you can be present and responsive.

Featured guest perspectives

"Rehearse until you can throw away the script... confidence comes from preparation, not from reading slides."

— Tristan de Montebello    "Practice out loud... the words feel different in your mouth than they do in your head."

— Matthew Dicks        5 Own the room with presence and conviction  Your physical presence matters as much as your content. Make eye contact, use deliberate gestures, and speak with conviction. If you don't seem to believe what you're saying, why would anyone else? Executive presence is largely about demonstrating genuine belief in your message.

Featured guest perspectives

"Executive presence is about conviction... there's something about them that's saying, this person really believes in what they're saying."

— Tristan de Montebello    "You're asking people to change... that requires courage and conviction from the presenter."

— Nancy Duarte

✗ Common Mistakes

Cramming too much information onto slides instead of making one point per slidePrioritizing data transfer over emotional connection and persuasionUnder-rehearsing and relying on slides as a crutchSpeaking to the screen instead of the audience     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

The audience stays engaged throughout, not checking phonesPeople take the action you wanted them to takeYou can adapt to audience reactions without losing your threadPeople remember your main point days or weeks later

"Make the title the takeaway of the slide so that the person looking at it has to do zero work to take away. So example, you'll sometimes see, 'The problem,' or, 'The team.' Replace, 'The team,' with, 'Our team is veterans of whatever industry,' or every single slide it's a takeaway, not a label."  Tactical:  Replace generic slide titles (e.g., 'The Team') with the specific takeaway (e.g., 'Our team has 20 years of industry experience').

"You want to de-risk that meeting not make it a big success or fail moment... I try to run through it with the team, pretending to be the other members of the audience that are going to be there... The other thing that I push a lot of my team to do is have pre-meetings with some of those key individuals, so that they're going to be less surprised in the meeting."  Tactical:  Role-play the presentation by impersonating specific stakeholders and their likely objectionsHold pre-meetings with key individuals to surface and address concerns before the formal review    "If you haven't thought through all the questions that might be asked from the document that you're sharing or the presentation you're about to present, you're not prepared enough, right. You need to know the entire universe of how that meeting can go."  Tactical:  Prepare a 'universe' of potential questions and have the supporting data ready in front of youLearn from mistakes in past meetings to identify which data points executives typically use to validate context

Dharmesh Shah 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I have custom software that I've written that will say, 'Okay, here are the points at which the audience laughed.' Actually audibly laughed. That's the only way it counts. And this actually... and it comes down to this metric that standup comedians use called LPM laughs per minute."  Tactical:  Transcribe practice runs and map out exactly where the audience laughs.Aim for a minimum LPM (e.g., 1.25 for business talks) to maintain attention.Shorten segments where there are long gaps between laughs.    "when you're telling the story, whatever the funny bit is, those have to literally be the last words of that particular segment. So once you deliver it, then you have to stop talking. And the reason you have to stop talking is the audience needs about a half a second to react, and then they want the permission to laugh."  Tactical:  Place the punchline at the very end of the sentence.Pause immediately after a funny point to give the audience permission to laugh.

"One idea at a time, this notion of you give them one egg, someone can catch it, give them too many eggs, they're going to drop it. So don't try to throw too many concepts all at once. Keep it simple. People will appreciate it. And so with every sort of presentation, break it down into the core concepts, try to make sure you're covering one at a time."  Tactical:  Break presentations down into distinct, simple core concepts.Avoid overwhelming the audience with too many ideas simultaneously.

"One of the things that Mind the Product has been able to provide to speakers is a speaker coach... She helped with posture. She helped with delivery. She helped with even just phrasing of words. Just making sure that everything landed in particular ways. And one of the things she did was make me listen to it and play it back."  Tactical:  Record yourself and listen to the playback to improve deliveryPractice the talk until you can do it flawlessly in everyday situations like the shower or walking    "One of the things that I've stopped doing is I used to sit down with a PowerPoint and start writing my deck in PowerPoint or Slides, now. What I now do is I start with my story points. I start with my narratives. I try to figure out what I'm actually trying to say, and then I fit it into the deck."  Tactical:  Start with story points and narrative structure before creating slides    "One of the other things that actually really does work is the power pose, standing with your hands on your hips and it really does... help boost your confidence and make you feel better as you're getting ready to stand on stage."  Tactical:  Use a 'power pose' (hands on hips) before going on stage to boost confidenceWalk the stage during tech checks to get comfortable with the physical spaceFind 'fans' in the audience—people who are nodding and smiling—and deliver the talk to them

"Steve Jobs couldn't convince you to buy water if you were dying of thirst. He could not give a presentation to save his life. And Regis McKenna and his team took Steve Jobs under their wing and created Steve Jobs, a man who could sell anything to anybody. These are skills. This is not about personality."  Tactical:  Seek professional coaching to transform presentation abilities.Treat public speaking as a masterable skill rather than an innate trait.    "I never appeared before Congress with notes. I wanted them to believe, which was by the way, true, that I was in complete control and complete mastery of the material, and that I did not need notes or a bunch of assistants around me to help me."  Tactical:  Master your material so thoroughly that you do not require notes during high-stakes presentations.Use eye contact instead of looking down at scripts to project sincerity and control.

"I gave a TEDx talk a few years ago and I was like my entire body, I was just terrified. And I did in 15 minutes of this breathing practice before and walked on stage almost cool as a cucumber. It's very effective."  Tactical:  Perform 15 minutes of dedicated breathing practice immediately before a high-stakes presentationFocus on changing the physical state of the body to naturally shift the mind's narrative

"I love her book Resonate... she said what all these things do is they alternate tension between the world as it is and the world as it might be. And it's like, here's that beautiful future of transportation, San Francisco, blah, blah, blah, but here's why it sucks today, all these problems and this and that, but here's how it could look in a few years. And then you're creating that tension and the audience at the end is like sweaty palms."  Tactical:  Structure your narrative to highlight the gap between 'what is' and 'what could be'Use tension to build emotional investment from the audience

"I start with an outline on paper and then I draw little boxes for the slides and I write out the headline of the slides. And then once I have a tight outline... then I sketch out how I want the slides to go."  Tactical:  Draft the presentation outline on paper firstWrite the headline for every slide before designing themSketch slide layouts manually before moving to software

"Visualization is a really useful technique and you see yourself not just in the moment of speaking, but getting up to the stage, seeing it being well received, thinking about how you step off the stage. We see athletes do this kind of thing all the time, and there's good research to say that this desensitizes people."  Tactical:  Visualize the specific room and the people you will be speaking toEnvision the entire sequence from walking on stage to stepping offUse virtual reality tools or photos of the venue to make the visualization more concrete    "Strive for connection over perfection by daring to be dull. Just answer the question. Just give the feedback. Just be engaged in the small talk. By doing that, you dial down the volume of self-evaluation, freeing up resources that can be used to really help you succeed."  Tactical:  Give yourself permission to be 'dull' to free up cognitive bandwidthFocus on the immediate task (answering the question) rather than judging your performance    "When you feel those symptoms of anxiety, rather than seeing it as negative, say, 'This is exciting. I get to share my point of view. I get to demonstrate my value.' And in so doing by seeing it as more positive, it causes us by definition to relax."  Tactical:  Reframe physical symptoms (fast heart rate, sweating) as signs of excitementIdentify specific exciting elements of the speaking opportunity to lean into    "I have a rule of thumb, I jokingly call it a rule of lung. You want your exhale to be twice as long as your inhale. So if you take a three count in, even if you sneak in a little extra air as we were talking about, take a six count out."  Tactical:  Use a 1:2 ratio for breathing (e.g., 3 seconds in, 6 seconds out)Incorporate a 'double inhale' to fully expand the lungs before the long exhale    "I have an acronym. It works. It's called WHAT. W-H-A-T. The W stands for why are we here? ... The H is how are you connected to the event? ... The A stands for anecdote. Tell a story or a quick example that is relevant and accessible to everybody. ... And then ultimately the last part is the gratitude, the thank you."  Tactical:  State the purpose of the gathering (Why)Establish your relationship to the person or event (How)Share a concise, non-insider story (Anecdote)End with a clear expression of thanks or a salute (Thanks)    "I have yet another structure... It's called ADD for adding value. You answer the question cleanly and concisely. You then give an example to reinforce the answer, and then you explain the relevance or significance of the answer so people know it."  Tactical:  Answer the question directly and conciselyProvide a detailed example to ground the answerDescribe the relevance to explain why the answer matters to the listener

"98% of your nervousness is actually before you begin speaking. Once you begin speaking, almost all of your nervousness falls away... preparation is going to reduce your level of nervousness. One of the best ways to prepare for it is to record it and listen to it."  Tactical:  Record your presentation and listen to it passively while doing other tasks.Focus on memorizing transitions between 'scenes' rather than the entire script.Practice 'bouncing' between the main points of the talk to ensure you know the sequence.    "I say it stakes, it's surprise, it's suspense, and it's humor. Those are the ways that you're going to hold people and keep them listening. And if you're not engaged in one of those four things while you're speaking, people are not listening to you anymore."  Tactical:  Audit your presentation to ensure it contains stakes, surprise, suspense, or humor at all times.Use 'nostalgia' as a safe and effective way to inject humor into business talks.

"Reframing that anxiety to understand that the thing your body is doing is surging you with adrenaline to help you. And so letting that feeling wash over you instead of fighting it, I think has been so effective for me... I rehearse probably at least 10 times all the way through once the speaker notes are final."  Tactical:  Reframe stage fright as a helpful adrenaline surgeRehearse the full presentation at least 10 timesMake frequent eye contact to appear natural even when using speaker notesIncorporate personal stories and humor to show genuine passion

"I love product ops because when we prepare for board meetings, I know there's a certain set of information that I'm going to have to put together for this board meeting, and then when we go do it manually, it becomes obsolete by the time the board meeting's over."  Tactical:  Create repeatable data pipelines for board meeting slides to ensure information is always current

"Slide one, you say what you do as if I literally know nothing... the second thing that I say to people is, I think your second slide ought to be, here's the thing we know that's not obvious... then slide three is what, if any, proof points do we have?"  Tactical:  Slide 1: State exactly what you do in plain language (e.g., 'We let you rent an extra room in your house')Slide 2: Share your 'earned secret' or non-obvious insight about the futureSlide 3: Provide proof points that validate the insightAvoid 'Franken-decks' that try to answer every possible objection from non-believers

"The ability to just have that contrast as a framework in your brain during a meeting, on a phone call, any moment of influence, like literally it works. It works in any format."  Tactical:  Use contrast as a mental model for meetings and callsFrame the current reality against a better future state    "Your audience is the hero. That was in my TED talk from 2011. I would say it's infuse your talk with story. And I would say it is asking yourself, can they see what I'm saying?"  Tactical:  Treat the audience as the hero and yourself as the mentorIncorporate story structuresEnsure every point has a visual component    "In myths and movies, the mentor comes alongside the hero. In other words, the presenter should come alongside the audience and help them get unstuck or bring a magical tool."  Tactical:  Identify the audience's internal conflict and provide a tool to soothe itAcknowledge the difficulty of the action you are asking the audience to take    "This motion of traversing between what is, what could be, what's is, what could be, what is, what could be, that sense of longing for the future, it makes people leave their current state or the status quo or our current reality and makes them long for this future state by using contrast."  Tactical:  Establish the 'what is' (status quo) firstRepeatedly contrast the current state with 'what could be'End with a 'new bliss'—the world with your idea adopted    "The concept that each slide should make one point... your whole presentation should be grounded in what we call the audience journey, which is the big idea where you're trying to move them from where you're trying to move them to."  Tactical:  Define your point of view and what is at stake if the audience rejects itLimit each slide to one core ideaAvoid using old slides from repositories unless they are modified for the specific audience    "I take a deep, deep breath and then I take that one while my lungs are full, I take another gulp of breath and I have to let it out real slow."  Tactical:  Use a 'double-inhale' breathing pattern to calm the nervous systemFind a quiet, dark space before going on stage to focusWatch funny videos right before presenting to shift body chemistry from anxiety to laughter

Paul Adams 1 quote

"I just froze. I couldn't remember what I was supposed to say. It was the first ever time in my life I'd rehearsed the talk word for word. Usually, I have talking points, and things get mixed around, and it's informal. This was media trained, "Do not say the wrong thing." Kind of talk."  Tactical:  Use talking points rather than a word-for-word script to remain adaptable on stage.

Petra Wille 2 quotes

"The easiest way is to get in front of really small and super friendly audiences. So that is, I think, the first starting point. And I don't know where that is. That could be your team, that's a super small audience, usually five to 10 people, or maybe you pine with your company of 80 people or 120 people, maybe the company all-hands is already something where you could actually speak."  Tactical:  Practice speaking in front of your immediate team or local meetups firstSeek feedback from peers for harsh critique and strangers for unbiased gapsIdentify 'friendly faces' in the front row to maintain energy    "I think the two things that work well, it's either the Superman pose, so that is one thing. If you're standing like this looking straightly up, that is one thing that helps many people. It's not my preferred one. And then the other one is a bit of the gorilla thing, just like tapping here... that bumps your energy level, so to say."  Tactical:  Use the 'Superman pose' backstage to build confidenceTry tapping the thymus (chest) to boost energy levels before entering the stage

Tristan de Montebello 5 quotes

Listen to episode →

"When I am trying to gather my thoughts or think, people tend to look down. And if you're looking down on Zoom, it's three times as bad because it looks like you're looking at your phone or looking at notes if you had any, but even when you're in person, it doesn't look very confident. If instead you switch that up and you start thinking up. I think up into the right, but you can think in any direction you want, but as long as you're looking up, you actually look thoughtful by default."  Tactical:  Avoid looking down when gathering thoughts during a presentation or meetingDirect your gaze upward to appear more confident and avoid being interruptedPlace a 'Think Up' post-it note on your monitor as a visual reminder    "Anticipate that as you get to the end of anything you're saying, you're going to naturally start regaining consciousness and you're going to start being a little bit more self-aware, and some of those uncertainties are going to pop up. Know that it's coming and make sure you land the plane. So what that looks like is, either you just make your ending sound like an ending and then leave it at that, or you can prompt your brain. You can use summary prompts, this is incredibly powerful."  Tactical:  Use summary prompts like 'In summary,' 'So my point here is,' or 'What I want you to remember' to trigger your brain to close the thoughtAvoid trailing off or expressing doubts like 'I don't know if that makes sense' at the end of a statementMaintain 'gas' on the delivery until the very last word is spoken    "The solution is just, don't share your insecurities. Put your best foot forward and stay in it the whole time. Stay in character from beginning all the way through past the ending, because you go all the way through your speech, then you got to end strong, which is a form of staying in character, and then let it be. And that's so important, just let it be and you're going to notice something incredible. If you're the type of person who would break character a lot, start staying in character, and the cue use for myself is, stay in it."  Tactical:  Commit to 'staying in character' as a confident speaker even when you feel internal turbulenceDo not apologize for minor verbal slips or admit to being nervous mid-speechUse the internal cue 'stay in it' to maintain composure during difficult moments    "The Accordion Method is saying... I'm going to take everything out of my living room except the most essential pieces that make my living room... And as I look at that, I'm going to have clarity on the vision I want for my living room. And then very slowly, very intentionally, I'm going to go take certain elements that were already there that I might want to bring back in, and I'm going to bring new elements that now I see make sense."  Tactical:  Practice your talk with strict time constraints, starting at 3 minutes and working down to 30 secondsOnce you reach the 30-second 'essence' of the talk, expand it back up to the original lengthFocus on internalizing key pillars and bookmarks rather than memorizing a word-for-word script    "The bow and arrow starts with a... mindset shift that most of us are in the weeds... we tend to focus more on what we want to say than what we want our audience to remember. The mindset shift here is stop focusing as much on what you want to say and focus more on what you want your audience to remember. We call it the bow and arrow technique because we think you can only remember one thing out of a talk... The one thing is your arrow."  Tactical:  Define a single sentence that represents the only thing you want the audience to rememberSelect specific anecdotes or data points (the 'bow') that provide the tension and weight needed to launch that 'arrow'Ensure every slide has its own 'one thing' or 'arrow' clearly identified in the title

"anytime he does a presentation now, every three to five slides, he'll put in a state change. So the idea of every three to five minutes, every three to five slides, go ahead and put in a stage change. We really want to turn this from an art into a science, as much as possible, audience engagement."  Tactical:  Insert an interactive element or state change every 3 to 5 slides.Ask the audience to guess a data point before revealing it to increase internalization.
