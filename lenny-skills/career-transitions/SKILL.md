Career Transitions  Career transitions are inevitable and often necessary for continued growth. Whether moving companies, pivoting industries, or making a radical life change, the key is approaching transitions with intentionality—using an 'explore/exploit' framework early in your career and developing clear criteria for evaluating opportunities. The best transitions are proactive acts of self-direction, not reactive escapes.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 76 experts.

1 Use the explore/exploit framework to guide career phases  Early career should be in 'explore' mode—testing hypotheses about company size, industry, function, and what energizes you. Once you find a rich vein, shift to 'exploit' mode and go deep on specific skill gaps. Be deliberate about which mode you're in and avoid getting stuck in exploration indefinitely or exploiting something that no longer serves you.

Featured guest perspectives

"My early career was pretty wild... it really comes down in a nutshell to this career concept of explore and exploit... You're either in a mode of explorer where you have a bunch of unknowns and you're testing to see whether or not you like it... Or you're exploiting, where you actually have found something that's really rich and really deep and then you're just trying to get more."

— Ada Chen Rekhi        2 Develop rigorous criteria for evaluating opportunities  Treat your next role with the same due diligence as an investor evaluating a startup. Create a personal evaluation framework—whether it's people, mission, and financials, or growth, learning, and impact. Back-channel your potential manager by talking to people they've managed. Ask to observe how leadership handles disagreement.

Featured guest perspectives

"PMF stands for people, mission and financials. And these are my three criteria... you should have a set of criteria that you are unapologetically rigorous around and you should learn how to evaluate companies against that set of criteria."

— Adam Fishman        3 Recognize when you're being 'boiled' by inertia  It's easy to stay in a role past its useful life because of comfort, compensation, or fear. Regularly evaluate whether you're still learning and being challenged. Monitor the direction your environment is trending. If growth has stalled and you're staying due to inertia rather than intention, it may be time to explore internally or externally.

Featured guest perspectives

"It's really easy to be a victim of inertia. It's really easy for all of us to be the frog where there are little things that make us uncomfortable, and we sit with them... you really have to be aware of your surroundings. You have to be aware of which way is the direction of the temperature of the water trending."

— Ada Chen Rekhi        4 Frame major transitions as running toward something, not away  The most meaningful career changes come from proactive self-direction rather than reactive escape. Ask yourself: Is this a move toward the person I want to become, or just a flight from discomfort? The best transitions are acts of kindness toward yourself—reclaiming your identity and values, not just abandoning a job.

Featured guest perspectives

"The transitions that I talk about are the big fundamental ones... me, for example, stepping away from my career, at the end of the day, I wasn't running from something, I was running back towards myself. That was an act of kindness towards myself."

— Andy Johns    "It's important for people to understand that there are formative experiences in our lives which put us in positions to where we form adaptations in order to survive, just like my attachment to achievement and how my self-worth was entirely tied up in that."

— Andy Johns        5 Surround yourself with high-performing people and play the long game  Career success often comes from intentionally orbiting high-performing people and maintaining those relationships across multiple career moves. Identify 'A-plus' players early and find ways to work in their proximity. The opportunities that come from these long-term relationships compound over time.

Featured guest perspectives

"The first one is really about people. It's about surrounding yourself with the best people you can find... If you create enough opportunities, especially early on in your career... around hanging around people who are doing interesting things... the right things will happen."

— Manik Gupta

"My early career was pretty wild... it really comes down in a nutshell to this career concept of explore and exploit... You're either in a mode of explorer where you have a bunch of unknowns and you're testing to see whether or not you like it... Or you're exploiting, where you actually have found something that's really rich and really deep and then you're just trying to get more."  Tactical:  Use early roles to test hypotheses about company size, industry, and function.When in 'exploit' mode, choose roles based on specific skill gaps (e.g., growth, pricing) rather than just titles.Be an agent in your own career by having proactive conversations with managers about what you want to learn.    "It's really easy to be a victim of inertia. It's really easy for all of us to be the frog where there are little things that make us uncomfortable, and we sit with them... you really have to be aware of your surroundings. You have to be aware of which way is the direction of the temperature of the water trending."  Tactical:  Evaluate your role based on the 'learning' lens: are you being challenged and growing?If learning has stalled, either seek new projects internally or use the 'gift of time' to learn independently for your next move.

Andy Johns 2 quotes

"It was a difficult decision to walk away from my career at the peak of it, but I guess the takeaway, and then I'll stop for a bit, is it's important for people to understand that there are formative experiences in our lives which put us in positions to where we form adaptations in order to survive, just like my attachment to achievement and how my self-worth was entirely tied up in that."  Tactical:  Evaluate if your career drive is an 'adaptation' formed to cope with past emotional wounds.Recognize when professional success is no longer providing fulfillment and is instead becoming detrimental to your present state.    "The transitions that I talk about are the big fundamental ones like the transition that I've been going through myself... me, for example, stepping away from my career, at the end of the day, I wasn't running from something, I was running back towards myself. That was an act of kindness towards myself."  Tactical:  Frame a career exit as 'running back towards yourself' rather than just running away from a role.Consider if your current career foundation is built on an identity that no longer serves you.

Ami Vora 3 quotes

"I realized that probably the most important thing is to just acknowledge that that is true for me. That I'm not going to be a person with a plan, and actually the thing that has consistently served me is to do the thing that feels right, go to the place that feels like home, work with the people who feel like my friends."  Tactical:  Choose roles where you feel 'lucky' to be there rather than just following a spreadsheet of axes.Focus on environments where trust is a 'big unlock' for your creativity.    "I try to just put on the coat of the job. When I wake up in the morning, I'm like, what would it be like if I were doing this job? What would I think about on my commute? Who would I have lunch with? Do I like them? What problems am I going to solve today?"  Tactical:  Visualize the daily routine of a potential job to gauge your emotional response.Assess the people you'll be working with as a primary factor in the decision.    "I convinced one of them to introduce me to everyone at the office. I'd made a trade, I said, I'll buy you a fancy coffee at Coupa Cafe in downtown Palo Alto, and in exchange just introduced me to everyone... And the only call I got back was from the Head of PR... 'But we need a temp to review our press releases, so if you want to come join a temp agency, we'll tell them to send you here.' And that's what I did."  Tactical:  Use your network to get office tours and meet as many people as possible.Be willing to start as a temp or in a role you are 'overqualified' for to enter a target company.

Annie Pearl 1 quote

"I think there's really two paths. I think one is more formal in nature. There are associate product manager programs out there and many scaled companies... I think another "more formal" way to get into PM is really by just directly applying to a junior PM role where there's no expectation of any sort of experience. I've usually seen this work best when you're already working somewhere in some product adjacency. Maybe you're in customer support, implementation, or maybe you're a sales engineer."  Tactical:  Apply to APM programs at both big tech and smaller, earlier-stage companies.Look for internal junior PM roles if you are already in a product-adjacent role like support or sales engineering.Seek opportunities to shadow PMs or take on 'side' product work to demonstrate skills.

"I definitely think doing it within the same company is a lot easier than trying to switch companies and switch jobs at the same time because when you're within a company, you've already built credibility, hopefully."  Tactical:  Join a product-adjacent function (Support, Sales, Eng) and build relationships with the product team.In small startups, volunteer for product-related projects that no one is currently owning.

"The framework is really that there's impact that you're really trying to drive and that is the thing that is the most important. And the impact is only achievable by looking at two sets of variables, a set of variables related to the environment, a set of variables related to your skills."  Tactical:  Score environment variables (manager, resources, scope, team, compensation, culture) on a scale of 0 to 2.Re-evaluate these scores annually to identify what is limiting your ability to have impact.

"I left Apple on a Friday and I started Pinterest on a Monday. I didn't give myself time to recalibrate to the Pinterest culture. I think at some level, a lot of the challenge is that Apple, and it's not just Apple, I think every major tech company, they have really powerful cultures. You get indoctrinated into all those standards and it's really deep."  Tactical:  Give yourself a multi-week or multi-month gap between high-intensity roles to 'wash off' the previous culture.Hold onto the values of your previous organization (e.g., excellence) but adapt your behaviors to the new culture's norms.

"And you start to realize that all of these things where we think we have to pay more money, over 50% of the people who got new jobs didn't get more money. It's a lie. It's about progress. It's about what do they want to learn? What skills do they want to get?"  Tactical:  When interviewing candidates, unpack their 'metric of progress' to see if it aligns with the role's growth opportunities.Identify the 'pushes' (frustrations at the current job) and 'pulls' (attractions of the new role) to understand a candidate's true motivation.    "The moment you stop making progress in your career is the moment you start looking for another job. And so over the last 15 years we've interviewed over a thousand people. I've coached almost a thousand people because I think there's a billion people a year who switched jobs and ultimately most of them end up with a job that's worse than the one they were at, but they don't know how to find it."  Tactical:  Identify the 'pushes' (reasons to leave) and 'pulls' (desired outcomes) driving your move.Determine which of the four quests you are on: Get Out, Next Step, Regain Control, or Realign.    "I call it a jobcation, which is a job I can go do with one hand tie by hide my back so I can rest and recover to go do something else. It's about actually being able to go to the gym and work out and have some vacations. The moment you are comfortable doing nothing, you know who you are again, and you can actually figure this out."  Tactical:  Look for roles where you are overqualified to allow for mental and physical recovery.Set a time limit on a jobcation to ensure it serves as a bridge, not a permanent stall.    "The thing that I think has been most powerful is, again, treating you like a product. How do we prototype different job positions for you? So how do we think of you? ... It's this notion of starting by doing what we call informational interviews to other jobs that are out there."  Tactical:  Conduct informational interviews with people currently in roles you are curious about.Prototype 'wide' across different industries to see how your skills translate beyond your current field.

"Jump into new things, give it six months. If it's not the thing, no problem. You just built a ton of new skills that's going to come in handy, I promise you that. Keep going."  Tactical:  Give a new role at least six months to see if you can develop a passion for it.Don't fear moving horizontally if you have exhausted the learning potential in your current domain.    "I think there's two really good places to be. I think one is carrying a lot of water in areas that the company's not paying attention to but you are important... The second-best place to be, or maybe equally, is on the most important thing."  Tactical:  Seek out 'rocket ship' projects where you can see how things work under extreme pressure.Alternatively, own a massive, stable area that the company relies on but doesn't micromanage.

"Don't stop being a hands-on technical until you feel like it's in your bones... I do think it's probably somewhere in the 10-year range of really having spent a lot of your time over those years writing code and really understanding how to be a technical expert."  Tactical:  Wait until you have 'internal confidence' in your technical skills before moving to managementDon't rush into management just because it's offered early in your career    "The fact that you really don't own your time as a manager. Your team and your management and the company owns your time... individual contributors often think that if they become a manager, they will still have some of the freedom that they have as a senior individual contributor."  Tactical:  Prepare for a schedule that is reactive to the team's needsShift mindset from 'command and control' to 'nudging and directing'

Christine Itwaru 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I'm seeing more PMs, like I said, go into the space. So, it's no longer being seen so much as a threat. It's being seen as this partner... if you love creating that healthy team environment and one where there's cross-functional collaboration and it fuels you to empower the team more, it's a wonderful fit for you."  Tactical:  Identify if you enjoy solving 'meta' problems (how the team works) more than specific product problemsTransition into product ops if you find fulfillment in empowering other PMs to succeed    "I strongly advocate for product ops leaders to have done that role, to have actually had hands-on product experience building and understanding customer problems and feeling that pain, because you very quickly realize where to place your efforts."  Tactical:  Leverage previous PM experience to identify which processes are actually 'painful' for the product team

"What I love to see is not so much what roles you've had... Give me, in a paragraph, a thorny problem you faced. What was the problem, and what skills you used to actually accomplish it, and what was the result of that?"  Tactical:  Write resume bullet points as 'thorny problems' with clear actions and results    "When you're interviewing, you're also interviewing them. When you're interviewing, it's not about you having to prove yourself. It's also for them to actually prove themselves as a company."  Tactical:  Approach interviews as a two-way evaluation of alignment

"the founder was just like, 'I've read that the cure to all our problems is going to be hiring product manager,' and you heard that and you googled, what is product management, and then you asked them, 'Can I do that?'"  Tactical:  Identify gaps in the organization where no one owns the customer problemVolunteer for 'shadow labor' or offload tasks from existing PMs to gain experience    "choosing where you want to break in is almost as important as choosing that you want to break in the first place. Thinking about who you're going to be reporting to, thinking about what's the track record of success for people at that company, breaking into product management, trying to think five years in advance and work backwards"  Tactical:  Evaluate potential managers based on their ability to coach and sponsor new PMsLook for smaller shops for lower barriers to entry, but be wary of the lack of formal training

"PM is such a generalist role, it's okay to go a little left and a little right to go up. I took this marketing growth role... It wasn't only for product, it was for marketing. And I had to learn marketing... but it was a foundation on which I could build a broader leadership career."  Tactical:  Look for growth opportunities outside the immediate scope of productUse generalist PM skills to fill gaps in other departmentsTreat lateral moves as a way to develop the breadth needed for C-level roles

"I chose to come to Stanford because... I was okay to take a risk of restarting my tenure clock. Becoming the first female director of SAIL, I was actually relatively speaking a very young faculty at that time, and I wanted to do that because I care about that community. I didn't spend too much time thinking about all the failure cases."  Tactical:  Evaluate transitions based on the potential for impact and the quality of the ecosystem/team.Avoid over-focusing on downside risks when a move aligns with your scientific or professional 'North Star'.

Deb Liu 2 quotes

"I always balance learning and impact, which was you can have the most impact, the job you know the best, but then you stop learning. And if you're learning all the time, you're not necessarily having impact. So how do you keep going back and forth and back and forth so that you're not going straight up a lot or you're actually laddering back and forth into different things where you're having an amazing time where you know everything and then you're the newbie again and learning new things."  Tactical:  Alternate between roles that leverage your expertise and roles that force you to learn new domainsDon't fear being the 'newbie' again as it prevents career stagnation    "The people who were most successful were the ones who actually through adversity, learned to turn stumbling blocks into stepping stones. They were the ones who got hard feedback and then came back stronger because now they learned what to do differently."  Tactical:  View hard feedback as a blueprint for improvement rather than a personal failingFocus on 'bouncing back quickly' from product or role failures

"Pull your superpowers out of your stories from your past and your present, and then eventually figure out how to apply them and transpose them to your future. But if you look at your peak experiences from life, from work, but especially from life... when you can look at these three stories as moments in time and you can lay them on top of one another, what you see at key moments is your superpowers popping through."  Tactical:  Analyze three distinct peak experiences (childhood, recent past, and career path) to find common themes that define your unique strengths.

"It's a quite substantial part of product owners who eventually become very successful by the way. So it's like a positive self-select, so it means that someone already succeeded in another role. So it's a guaranteed culture match, it's a guaranteed domain knowledge, and then they simply grow. Usually it could be operations managers or engineers."  Tactical:  Look for high-performing engineers or ops managers to transition into product rolesLeverage internal transfers to ensure a 'guaranteed culture match' in the product org

"I have been surrounded by amazing people in all these roles and I have a feeling that I learned a lot by osmosis and observation and then have been able to leverage that to be stronger in the roles I was sitting in."

"Full-time jobs are not the best way to monetize the skill that you have... My goal professional is actually to have options so I can choose what I want to do... Career optionality, being the ultimate north star for anybody in their professional journey."  Tactical:  Evaluate every career move based on whether it increases your future options (e.g., advisory, fractional, or interim roles).Earn the right to optionality by building deep expertise in full-time roles before transitioning to horizontal work like consulting.

"Build that growth advising muscle by staying on your day job. Don't quit your day job, and moonlighting and practice selling, closing, working, retaining, and that's where if you're successful there, you can be successful on your own."  Tactical:  Practice 'selling' and 'closing' through moonlighting before leaving a full-time roleFocus on building a personal brand and consultancy framework rather than just being a 'freelance operator'

"pivot is defined as a change in strategy without a change in vision. So we have this idea that the founder has the vision, then they try to figure out how to make the vision happen and they find a different way, but the vision stays constant."  Tactical:  Maintain fidelity to the visionChange the strategy based on learningAcknowledge that the vision itself may be discovered through the process

"We are seeing a larger percentage of our executive network... working on things like newsletters, podcasts... full-time advisors, fractional heads of growth, fractional heads of product one day a week... they love it because of the flexibility that it creates for them. They love it because of the high upside and non-linearity of possibility."  Tactical:  Develop 'specific knowledge' in a narrow niche where you can be among the best in the worldWork at high-growth, reputable companies to build the professional 'clout' necessary for advisory rolesGeneralize your operating lessons into frameworks that can be applied across different industries and company stages

"I told myself, if four years later Uber exits and I make a bunch of money, I owe it to myself to take a risk, because then I'll have four years of savings in my bank... I decided to leave Uber. And we'll talk about it a little later in the podcast, but I didn't plan like this, but I started writing a newsletter."  Tactical:  Use a major financial milestone (like an IPO or stock vesting) as a pre-planned trigger to take a professional risk.Ensure you have at least several years of savings before walking away from a high-compensation role to pursue a non-traditional path.

"In your career, it's just a lot like building a product. You have theories and hypotheses, you find ways to experiment with them, and then you were successful or you failed."

"I think great careers are built by knowing a lot of people doing great work so they know and want you on their teams, and just waiting for serendipity and then seizing it and jumping."  Tactical:  Prioritize building relationships with smart people over linear promotion pathsHelp others without expecting immediate returns to build a 'reservoir of goodwill'Be curious about what others are working on outside your core role    "I would much rather be the number two or number three person... in the leader in a space, than the top person. Say Google versus Yahoo. I saw even if you're the VP of product at Yahoo or the head of product at Yahoo versus a ICPM at Google, you probably want to be the ICPM at Google."  Tactical:  Prioritize the company's market position over your individual titleEvaluate if a company has the potential to be the #1 player in its segment before joining    "People who are joining the workforce new should generally join mid-stage companies because mid-stage companies you get some mentorship and it's not just basically whatever needs to be done and ultimately you don't build any deep skills. So mid-stage company I would define as something that is a multi hundred person company, but not maybe a thousand person company."  Tactical:  Look for companies that have reached product-market-channel fitTarget companies transitioning from a single product to a platform with multiple interlocking products

"Imagine that you're walking home from work and you see this bright, shiny object. You walk over and you realize it's a magic lamp. And you rub the lamp and this genie comes out and the genie says, 'Hey, I haven't been in this bottle for 10,000 years yet, so I'm not fully formed. So I can't give you three wishes. But what I can do is I can give you one wish. And the wish I can give you is whatever you throw yourself into with your whole life and your career, it's going to turn out great.'"  Tactical:  Ask yourself what you would pursue if success were guaranteedIdentify the 'genie goal' that is closest to your heartWork backwards from a successful 10-year outcome to determine your current path    "The biggest question I think with respect to your career is, within reason, what would you do if you knew you wouldn't fail?"  Tactical:  Ask: 'If you didn't have to make money, what would you do?'Identify 'play' for you that is 'work' for othersIdentify the thing you want to do but are too embarrassed to say out loud    "You basically come up with nine lives. So you say your first life, life one is the life you have now... The first rule is all the lives have to start from today... And the second rule is you have to be excited about all these lives."  Tactical:  List nine different lives/careers you would be excited to start todayIdentify which life gives you the most energyPull elements of those 'other lives' into your current life as side projects or hobbies

"I'd really start zoning in on roles where you might see if you don't have the functional experience, the industry experience. I think that would go a long way as how to help you differentiate from yes, what's probably more candidates, or more applications going into each role."  Tactical:  Target roles where your previous industry background provides a unique advantageAdd specific credentials and work products to your skills profile to provide evidence of capability

"Being a manager is not as much fun as being an IC. It's a lonely job. When your team goes out for drinks, they treat you differently when you're the manager than when you're one of the other ICs. It's more painful and less fun."  Tactical:  Consider the 'loneliness' factor before pursuing a management trackTreat the move to management as a 'two-way door' that you can reverse if it doesn't fit    "I think understanding that there's different ways to grow your impact and grow your career, other than getting promoted to people management... you can make a lot of money without getting that promotion title. If you're working at a small company, if you're working with other companies that isn't the highest paying company, you'll make a lot more money by switching companies than you will by getting promoted at your current company."  Tactical:  Use sites like levels.fyi to understand IC compensation benchmarksLook for high-impact IC roles in platform or partnership teams    "One mistake I see people make early in their career is they are trying to overdo it... A lot of times you've been assigned a problem where a huge creative solution is a bad idea. If you're in one of the situations, just do the simple thing, get it done really well. And that'll earn you the trust to be able to take on bigger things in the future."  Tactical:  Focus on doing the 'simple thing' exceptionally well for your first projectsAvoid over-engineering solutions for constrained problems

"Being a PM actually provides you with a lot of the skills and background to be a founder, to be a CEO. It gives you a lot of chance to work with a lot of the different teams and see a lot of the underpinnings of how business works."  Tactical:  Work closely with leadership in current roles to observe how business decisions are madeSurround yourself with advisors for different functional areas (legal, finance, etc.) to fill knowledge gaps when starting a company

"The framework I like is ladder versus map, and I think that you can be either person that any point in your life... Ladder is about moving up. It's more influence, more power, a higher title, things like this, whereas map is I just want to go wherever's interesting... I'm okay with discomfort because it's interesting."  Tactical:  Prioritize interesting problems and character-building experiences over linear title progression.Accept short-term discomfort or 'risky' moves if they lead to unique learnings and stories.

"making that initial transition is really hard. What I've seen is the path that we just talked about, join a startup and then from there go into different companies. And then the other path that is typical is being at a company and then switching product management, especially if you develop domain expertise and there's a need for a PM."  Tactical:  Join a startup as one of the first PMs to establish a track record.Leverage existing domain expertise to switch into a PM role within your current company.

"I do have an unusual background, but it doesn't surprise me that people who are interested in product are also interested in investing and vice versa. For me, I've always had three interests broadly and that's an interest in business, an interest in technology and an interest in markets. And I get to express those interests both in investing and in product, but just with different weights."  Tactical:  Identify the common threads between your current role and your target role (e.g., business, tech, and markets).Leverage high conviction in a specific product or company to facilitate a move from investing into an operating role.

And then the reason why I switched to research is because I realized, "Oh my God, Claude is getting better at front-end. Claude is getting better at coding. I think Claude can develop new apps.""  Tactical:  Monitor the capabilities of the models you are building with to see if they are beginning to automate your own core technical skills.

"I think it's so easy for a young person to go into their career and everyone is telling them... 'You need to get that manager title.'... I think sometimes people opt into this without knowing what they're actually signing up for. What are the trade-offs? And is that really what you want to do?"  Tactical:  Evaluate if a promotion to management aligns with your actual passions or just external pressure.Define your goals (e.g., 'deepening craft' vs. 'VP title') before committing to a new career path.

"I was fired from Slack three different times... I spent that year being fully out of integrity with myself. Never saying what I really wanted, how I really felt because it didn't feel safe. I was too scared. I kept it all inside. And it took me six months or a year even after that to really feel safe and okay again."  Tactical:  Articulate what success looks like early in a new roleListen to 'nos' from management as data points rather than personal attacksStay in integrity by expressing your true feelings and desires even when it feels risky

"I discourage people from going straight into product management. If they want to become product managers, you encourage them to start somewhere else first. Why is that? ... The people that should be doing that are the people who are building it. That's an engineer, that's a designer, that's a sales person or a support person."  Tactical:  Start as an engineer, designer, or salesperson to gain exposure to building and customer problems.Use these roles to develop a unique perspective before transitioning into a formal PM role.    "I land my first official, by title, PM job at a startup. I made it. I've arrived... the company is really struggling and so we go through a series of rolling layoffs and I'm round 4 something... my identity that has been completely crushed... I thought I was a product manager. This is evidence I am not."  Tactical:  Reflect on what was in your control versus what was a result of the business environment.Recognize that failing in one 'habitat' doesn't mean you lack the skills to flourish in another.

"Moments that stretch you or moments that you feel uncomfortable in or you find yourself saying, "Oh shit. I shouldn't be here," or, "I'm under qualified to be here," those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, "Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?" And that's a very ambiguous, in my opinion, way to ask this question. A much sharper way is like, "Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?""  Tactical:  Seek out roles or projects that make you feel uncomfortable or underqualified.Audit your last 6-24 months to count specific moments of significant stretching.

"I think breadth is incredibly important. It's so critical, especially if someone has an end goal of wanting to step into a product leadership role to have been able to have touched lots of different components, as opposed to specializing in one specific thing."  Tactical:  Rotate through different areas like platform, core product, growth, or monetization.Mix experience between early-stage entrepreneurial roles and established 'academy' companies.    "Logo collecting is never something that you want to be known for... but there's also something to be said about staying somewhere too long though. And I will say that. I think sometimes you find people that are almost loyal to a fault... I think sometimes in your career you do have to be a little bit more selfish and think about what's going to be best for you in the long haul."  Tactical:  Avoid 'jumping' patterns (less than a year) unless there is a clear, honest reason.Ensure you stay long enough to leave a 'fingerprint' or measurable impact that others can verify.    "Work backwards from a goal for sure, but don't allow titles or valuation bubbles or other things to derail something that feels good. If you're in a role and you feel like you're making an impact and you're learning and you're growing and are excited about the work you're doing, do not allow a title of some other company to make you feel like what you're doing isn't worthwhile."  Tactical:  If your goal is CEO, move from product into GM roles with P&L ownership.Ignore title-only 'step ups' if the current role offers better learning and impact.

"One inflection point that I've seen is, when you go from being a manager, a first line manager, to becoming a manager of managers, and if you're able to navigate that with very strong effectiveness, then you know... Because managing ICs is so different from managing managers, because then you now need to create a structure. You need to be able to determine how much you delegate. How do you coach? How do coach your managers to do the right thing?"  Tactical:  Focus on building scalable structures rather than managing individual tasks.Develop a coaching framework to help your direct reports become better managers themselves.

"You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do... At a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things."  Tactical:  Perform a self-assessment to identify gaps between project management and true product management.Take agency to move from being a 'backlog administrator' to a 'creator' within your current company.

"It's why as an early career product manager, or it's why frankly at any stage of your career when you want to learn, you should join a winning team... I want to hear what they learned from being part of a winning team. And that's sort of one of my go to heuristics when I'm looking at candidate profiles."  Tactical:  Prioritize joining 'winning' teams where you can observe success patterns firsthand.Look for companies in 'crazy growth mode' to accelerate your career learning.

"The best thing you can do is find companies that are growing fast because it compounds your learning at a much faster interval."  Tactical:  Prioritize high-growth companies over established ones early in your career.Look for 'category-defining' companies where you have to solve problems for the first time in history.    "Do not optimize for compensation, especially early in your career. If you're truly on a track to become an executive someday... you will make 90% of your compensation in the last five years of your career."  Tactical:  Choose roles based on learning potential and superpower alignment rather than a 10-20% salary bump.Decide early if you want the C-suite path, as it requires different sacrifices and decision-making.    "Early career you want to be in intensely talents dense areas... For general tech, there's no better place than West coast of the US."  Tactical:  If possible, start your career in a high-talent-density hub like the US West Coast, Dubai (for crypto), or Bangalore.

"The way a lot of people do careers is a set of stairs. Just walk up the stairs and you'll get promoted every two years. But that is boring. The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs and you do fall, but then you climb out way beyond where the stairs could ever get you."  Tactical:  Embrace being a 'professional idiot' for the first 6-9 months of a new, challenging role.Distinguish between financial fear (which requires math and a 'burn rate' calculation) and the fear of failure (which is often a green light for growth).Ask 'dumb' questions in meetings to accelerate learning in unfamiliar domains.

"They were extremely careful about only making people PMs who had first proven themselves out as forward deployed engineers. You basically could not become a PM any other way... the reason for that's pretty simple, it's going to be someone who understand how customers work and has that customer empathy."  Tactical:  Look for PM candidates who have successfully managed field deployments or direct customer problem-solving.Prioritize internal promotions from technical field roles into product management.

"It's your job when you're in the interview process to figure out what that burning problem is. So, put on your discovery hat and go figure out what is the actual job to be done of the hiring manager when they're bringing on a new PM onto their team? And if you can do that and then make a good case that you are the person to solve that problem, then hiring you becomes a binary choice."  Tactical:  Ask the hiring manager about their specific OKRs and how a new hire can help achieve them.Position yourself as the specific solution to their burning problem rather than a generalist candidate.    "Just act like you already worked there. What would you do? ... During the interview loop... you can ask, 'Hey, can you put me in touch with an engineering manager who's working on the same problem?' And if no one else is asking, again, you're going to have an extra piece of feedback."  Tactical:  Request to speak with cross-functional peers (like Eng Managers) to understand the team's challenges.Ask deep, specific questions that demonstrate you are already thinking about the work.

"I think getting into startups as a product manager is a pretty awesome way to get into product because it's just a lot of problem-solving. The problem with that is you don't have anyone to teach you the right way, but the product will teach you the right and wrong way if you're with a team that is moving quickly."  Tactical:  Look for roles in smaller products or companies to get hands-on experience with all functionsUse the product's market performance as a feedback loop in the absence of formal mentorship

So if they're in a moment where they're trying to decide between another job, if they're trying to decide to leave, if they're having sort of an alert at work, I call them 911 calls. I take a few 911 calls every week and from a relatively large group of people. So I find those are the most substantive times to help people, is when they're in moments of dilemma or forks in the road"  Tactical:  Seek external perspectives during '911' moments of career dilemmaFocus on the long-term arc rather than just the immediate next step

"A three month sabbatical is much more attainable than people think. Companies are desperate to keep people and are much more open to things like this these days. And the way I frame it is if you're assuming you're going to work continuously in adulthood, that's about 500 months. Try to find three months of that where you can create space and reconnect with yourself, explore things, just see what emerges, see how you feel."  Tactical:  Aim for a three-month block to allow for proper unwindingFrame the request to employers as a way to stay with the company long-term    "I've found it takes six to eight weeks just to unwind."  Tactical:  Budget at least 6-8 weeks of 'unwinding' time before expecting creative breakthroughs    "I always tell people you need a boomer compatible story for what you're up to, as just give them something. Just say, 'I'm an entrepreneur,' or, 'I'm a business owner.'"  Tactical:  Adopt 'legible' titles like 'entrepreneur' or 'business owner' to explain your path to family and friends    "I call it ship, quit, and learn, which is what is the quickest way I can ship something designed to quit, but as soon as I ship it, I learn about what to do next?"  Tactical:  Design small experiments (like a 5-episode podcast) with a pre-set 'quit' date to lower the stakes of trying something new

So the question is how do you step there?"  Tactical:  Identify if your goal role is currently out of reach based on market conditions.Consider taking an individual contributor (IC) role at a top-tier company to reset your trajectory.Look for internal promotion opportunities from a role you are currently a fit for.

"I had a ton to learn about marketing, with what I knew really well... I spent my life in engineering, and in any product, it's not the go to market side, even. I was never part of the go to market, or I have never heard of a lead in my life. I did not know the word "pipeline.""  Tactical:  Follow 'good people' rather than a rigid career plan.Identify the 'heat' in the organization—the area where the most critical bottleneck exists—and move toward it.    "I do feel like an imposter, and I know there's always those statistics about many people feeling that way. So I think, maybe just, "Let's embrace it. I feel like an imposter, you feel like an imposter, everybody feels like an imposter," It's kind of, maybe embrace it, but don't let that stop you from making a decision."  Tactical:  Don't wait for confidence to take on a new role; be okay with the possibility of failing while attempting it.

"The advantage a smaller company has really is in latency. You can have an idea one day, you can test it the next day, and as a result you can have this really short cycle time between an assumption or a hypothesis and being able to validate that hypothesis. That's just not true at larger companies where there's a lot more momentum."  Tactical:  When moving to a startup, shift focus from high-velocity execution to reducing the time between hypothesis and validation.Boil down ambitious plans into smaller, iterative pieces that provide data every few days or weeks.    "I think it's important to plug into an early stage network as soon as possible... the people sort of really build their lifestyles and their careers around a particular stage. And there are some people that like to move between stages, but the majority of people don't."  Tactical:  Join communities like Indie Hackers or Everything Marketplaces to connect with early-stage builders.Connect with angel investors to understand current technology trends and early-stage challenges.Look for 'generalist' talent rather than specialists when hiring for the earliest stages.

Shreyas Doshi 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"For about a year, I was doing the product job without having the title and I was also the engineer. So I was in this great state where I'd figure out what needed to be built and I would just build it myself. So, that's how I started. And at some point during that one year, I realized that while I was a good engineer, I was perhaps a top 20% engineer. I realized that I would never be a great engineer, that I would never be a top 10% engineer because I saw those engineers, the fortune of working with them, and I just could tell that I couldn't be that."  Tactical:  Look for opportunities to attend customer meetings as an engineer to understand user needs.Start building solutions for customer problems independently to demonstrate product thinking.    "I have to abandon the traditional path, that like, 'Oh, after this level, I'm supposed to do this, and then I'm supposed to do this, and then this is what society expects... Identify your superpowers, because if you identify your superpowers and work in accordance with them, you will do the best work of your life.'"  Tactical:  Identify whether your 'happy place' is at the Impact, Execution, or Optics level.Be willing to move to earlier-stage products or smaller teams if you find 'optics' work (common in large orgs) frustrating.Make career decisions based on self-truth rather than envy or external expectations.

"My career has been a little bit like a bingo card. I've always been looking to fill in boxes I didn't have filled because I felt like that would make me a better professional. It's like if I didn't know anything about that specific type of sales model or that type of marketing or that type of product management... well, if I learn about that thing, I will become more versatile."  Tactical:  Identify 'empty boxes' on your professional experience card (e.g., consumer vs. B2B, sales vs. product) and seek roles that fill them.    "It's to constantly be choosing things that are either outside that, not totally outside the lines. Don't jump out of a plane if you've never parachuted before. Obviously you want them to be in some way and adjacency, that you want them to have something in common with what you know, but you want them to stretch you and change you."  Tactical:  Look for roles that share one commonality with your current experience but introduce two or three new variables.

"My advice is if you're coming from design and research background, then you pick data or tech. If you're coming from a data or tech background, then you pick design and research, and that gives you the maximum leverage because that's a skill that you will necessarily not have developed over the years."  Tactical:  Identify your 'opposite' skill set (e.g., Tech if you are from Design) and prioritize learning itLeverage your existing strengths while aggressively filling gaps in unfamiliar domains    "It also makes a big difference if you are transitioning when you are slightly younger in your career. If you are already senior in a function and then you are transitioning, sometimes it can take a lot of time in transitioning and picking up those skills."  Tactical:  Be prepared to 'go slow' during a transition to build a foundation for faster growth laterSeek a strong product leader to mentor you through the skill-shaping phase of a transition

"I think that it's, first of all, a really great empathy building exercise of understanding that point of view, and also pushing yourself to push on the product from a different angle. Because I think as a PM, you're in the center facilitating all these different trade offs, and when you go into design, you have to ignore some of those other aspects to really be insistent on pushing on the best experience possible."

And if it was green, it gave me energy and I felt excited and I wanted to keep working on that."

Tactical:  Choose roles based on where you will learn the fastestBalance the 'art' of intuition with the 'science' of data early in your career    "You got to figure out what are you optimizing for, what goes well with you. I've seen many successful leaders who will get choked up in a big company environment, and I've seen many big company successful executives who want to choke up in a very startup environment."

"I never had a five-year plan... follow people. You learn the most from people. I don't look for domains... you follow people who are the best at what they do.

Tactical:  Identify the best practitioners in your field and seek opportunities to work with them.Join companies where there is a 'nexus' of great people to build a lasting network.    "Take a job where if you hire people, it's going to make their careers... you want to make sure that it's going to be a good place for them and that they're going to learn and they're going to grow. And so you want to do right by them. And you really earnestly want to say you can make your career by coming here."  Tactical:  Avoid 'turnaround' jobs if they don't offer a clear path for your team's growth.Prioritize learning opportunities over unpredictable financial returns when choosing a role.
