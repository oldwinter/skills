Analyzing User Feedback  User feedback is everywhere: support tickets, sales calls, Reddit, social media, and surveys. The challenge is synthesizing it into actionable insights without losing critical nuance. Treat every escalation as a gift, use AI to process large volumes, and balance quantitative data with direct qualitative observation.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 56 experts.

1 Centralize and aggregate all feedback sources  Valuable product insights are often trapped in silos like Salesforce, support tickets, and sales call transcripts. Use tools like Dovetail or AI-driven analysis to aggregate and synthesize feedback from all sources into a queryable database that prevents redundant research.

Featured guest perspectives

"The first product we launched is called Reforge Insights, which acts like your AI product researcher, aggregates all the feedback from all the sources, uses AI to analyze it, helps you explore it, but also will start to identify what are the gaps, the things that you don't have in your feedback today."

— Brian Balfour    "It's also about aggregating all the interviews or customer research that's been done so people can query it and start to see what do we already know so we're not going out there and duplicating a bunch of research."

— Melissa Perri + Denise Tilles        2 Cluster feedback into behavioral pathways, not demographics  Don't just look for themes; cluster feedback into 'pathways' that reveal the different reasons users hire or fire your product. Look for conflicts where one user group wants speed while another wants thoroughness. Use LLMs to bucket user intent from unstructured conversational data.

Featured guest perspectives

"And then what we do is instead of trying to look for themes across all of them, we actually do something, instead of segmenting them, we cluster them, we find the pathways because what you start to realize is it's not one reason why people do it, it's sets of reasons."

— Bob Moesta        3 Treat every support ticket and escalation as a product failure  Customer support interactions are signals of product friction. Treat every escalation as a gift that enables deep root cause analysis. Track 'customer confusion' tickets as a primary metric and share every negative review with the relevant tech lead, PM, and designer monthly.

Featured guest perspectives

"The first principle there was saying, 'Well, every support ticket is a failure of our product.' We literally have that as a quote just posted on all those channels. It's a failure."

— Geoff Charles    "There's no greater gift to me as a product executive than receiving an escalation from a customer... Escalations are a gift... it's people who are just particularly skilled at pistol whipping other people in the company to get to real root causes."

— Matt MacInnis        4 Monitor unfiltered community platforms like Reddit  Reddit and similar platforms provide higher-signal feedback on product flaws and 'real' user sentiment than polished social platforms or direct surveys. Use Reddit's upvoting mechanics to prioritize which user pain points to address first.

Featured guest perspectives

"A few of us are constantly on Reddit. There's praise up there and there's a lot of complaints... Reddit is a little more negative but real actually. So I've started increasingly paying attention to how people are talking about using Codex on Reddit actually... you get good signal on what matters and what other people think."

— Alexander Embiricos        5 Create a 'bad day' chart to track friction  If you're unsure what to measure, emit a log line every time a user hits a 404, delay, or decline. Create a stacked bar chart of 'bad day' reasons to identify the most frequent pain points. This creates a prioritized backlog of quality improvements.

Featured guest perspectives

"If you are unsure what to measure... just make a user having a bad day chart, emit a log line and count it as a bar chart... It's like, oh, I'm working on making this chart go up and it feels good to just say the name out loud."

— Jeff Weinstein

✗ Common Mistakes

Over-relying on dashboards at the expense of qualitative understandingFiltering feedback through intermediaries and losing critical nuanceTaking user requests at face value instead of understanding the underlying needDismissing research insights as 'obvious' due to hindsight bias     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

You have a centralized, queryable database of customer feedbackProduct decisions are informed by both quantitative data and qualitative contextYou regularly uncover 'knowledge gaps'things customers aren't telling youNegative feedback trends decrease over time as you address root causes

"You cannot practically sit and evaluate all the traces. You need some indication to understand what are the things that I should look at. And this is where production monitoring helps. And once you get this kind of traces, you need to examine what are the failure patterns that you're seeing in these different types of interactions."  Tactical:  Use production monitoring to flag problematic traces for deeper review.Identify recurring failure patterns in user interactions to inform the creation of new evaluation datasets.

"We did case studies throughout the process. We got feedback on logos. We got feedback on brand and designs, and there were plenty of people who were like, 'Oh, I like RealtimeBoard. It's straightforward.' They loved their product, but ultimately, we kept many of them informed and we really involved them in the process to the degree of not slowing us down but still getting feedback."  Tactical:  Run case studies and feedback sessions on new logos and designs with existing usersKeep early advocates informed of major changes to maintain their sense of ownership

"The synthesis of both this qualitative and quantitative data as a theme that I saw arising across our customer base... bringing all of these different inputs that would traditionally be handled by product manager... to the surface when they're going through their product development lifecycle planning."  Tactical:  Aggregate qualitative feedback from sales and success with quantitative usage dataSurface synthesized feedback themes specifically during the product development lifecycle planning phase    "We brought those folks in a room together... our head of professional services team at one point was like, 'Whoa, this could truly impact what we do from an onboarding perspective and now we have this data.'... The PM got risk data, high-priority deals, feedback from our feedback product. What are we hearing from prospects versus paying customers."  Tactical:  Bring revenue, success, and product teams together to review feedback collectivelySegment feedback by customer type, such as prospects versus paying customers, to identify high-priority deals at risk

"We implemented Intercom back in the early days... Dylan would jump in, an engineer would jump in. And he'd open up a chat with people and they'd actually debug the product with us live. They'd be like, "I have this bug," and this engineer would be like, "Let me QA it right now.""  Tactical:  Have the entire team, including engineers and founders, participate in early customer supportDebug issues live with users to demonstrate extreme care and responsiveness    "We decided a couple years ago, we had this idea where we were like, oh, what if we package all of those quality updates up into one thing and launch them together and we could even show the tweet or the forum request that spurred us to do this. And that was where our idea of little big updates came."  Tactical:  Run 'quality weeks' where engineers fix small, high-annoyance bugsPublicly credit the specific user requests or tweets that inspired the updates

"The first step in conquering data like this is just to write notes... You sample your data and just take a look, and it's surprising how much you learn when you do this."  Tactical:  Sample production traces and manually annotate themPerform 'open coding' by writing down the first thing seen that is wrong    "Keep looking at traces until you feel like you're not learning anything new... theoretical saturation."  Tactical:  Aim for 'theoretical saturation' where no new error categories emergeReview at least 50-100 traces to build a representative taxonomy of errors

"If you look at what people do on Spotify's homepage... it is almost 90% what we call recall... When we tested the design... we switched it from 90/10 to 10/90. 10% recall, 90% discovery. And while people want discovery, they probably don't want 90% discovery, instead of 90% recall."  Tactical:  Distinguish between 'recall' intent and 'discovery' intent in usage dataCompare new user cohorts (who have no old habits) against long-term users to identify if feedback is about habit-breaking or bad design

"It is the founder's job to interpret that because a lot of feedback you get is this is the old way, they're responding this way because it's the old way of working... 80% noise, 20% had I not asked this question, I wouldn't have gotten that gold in terms of where they are today."  Tactical:  Apply the 80/20 rule to feedback: 80% is noise based on legacy habits, 20% is the 'gold' that guides the future product.

Nicole Forsgren 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Data from people and data from systems are really important compliments because we can get certain insights from people that we'll never get from systems. Let's look at lead time from changes, for example, from commit to deploy. The speed might be fine, but people might tell you it's taking absolute heroics. It's some ridiculous Rube Goldberg machine. The system will never tell you that."  Tactical:  Survey developers at least once a year to uncover insights that automated systems cannot capture.Look for disagreements between system data and user surveys; the surveys are often the more accurate reflection of reality.

"You have to be great at pulling feedback, listening to it. You have to triangulate it from people that don't see you all the time, that do see you all the time, your peers. But you have to create an environment of safety where people feel like there is no worry about retaliation or concern"  Tactical:  Repeat feedback back to the provider better than they articulated it to show internalizationPublicly share and credit constructive feedback you've received to encourage a feedback cultureLook at the 'discard pile' of feedback—anomalies you previously dismissed—to find hidden development areas

Oji Udezue 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Customer listening is different. It's not really discovery. It is the scarfing up of customer signals that are happening constantly anyway. So people are talking on social, people are talking on app stores and G2 crowd. If you have a instrumented churn survey, people are talking. If you have NPS, people are not only giving you the scores where they're putting in the verbatims."  Tactical:  Triage signals from Zendesk, Salesforce (closed-won/lost notes), and app store reviews to see frequency distributions.Organize a system where PMs and designers have customer signals automatically surfaced to them to reduce the friction of 'listening'.

"There's a great concept in the literature on rating systems called the sound of silence, which is this idea that there's a lot of information in ratings that are not left... this was much more predictive of downstream performance of a seller. So there's a lot of information in that lack of a response."  Tactical:  Incorporate 'non-responses' into your quality metrics to get a more accurate picture of participant performance.

"We call it build with writers, build with readers... do it in a way where we bring writers along... We actually have now we've set up something called the Product Lab... an invite only little group of a hundred or so writers that we know are interested in being on the bleeding edge."  Tactical:  Run small pilots with a subset of users to test high-risk or fundamental changes.Use direct feedback from these groups to iterate on the feature's design before it hits the broader dashboard.

Sean Ellis 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"One of my favorite questions is... 'What is the primary benefit that you get?' And then I use that initially as an open-ended question to kind of crowdsource different benefits people are getting. But then I run another survey where I turn it into a multiple choice question, force them to pick one of four distinctive benefit statements. And then the question that follows on that next survey is, 'Why is that benefit important to you?'"  Tactical:  Crowdsource benefits with open-ended questions first.Use multiple-choice follow-ups to force prioritization of benefits.Ask 'Why is this important to you?' to understand the user's context and pain points.    "Why don't we just ask them why they signed up and didn't download the software? ... we just asked, 'Hey, notice you haven't had a chance to use the product yet. It looked like it was coming from customer support. What happened?' And the answer we got back... was, 'Oh, this seemed too good to be true. I didn't believe this was free.'"  Tactical:  Send personal-looking emails from 'customer support' to users who drop off at specific funnel steps.Ask open-ended questions about why they didn't complete a specific action (e.g., downloading or installing).

Shaun Clowes 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"He used to call this concept a Feedback River, and he basically said that really smart product managers are constantly swimming at a Feedback River. They set out to surround themselves by Feedback River and I really deeply believe in that."  Tactical:  Set up automated streams of user interview data, NPS, and competitor info to 'wash over' you daily.    "We use LLMs to take in those asks to summarize what they're about, to find other asks that are like that one, really in a compelling way, a real way, like a semantic way, not other words, exactly the same, are these the same concept? So that we can look across all of the inbound demand on us and say, 'Well, the most popular idea is this one and is getting more popular.'"  Tactical:  Use LLMs to perform semantic clustering on inbound customer requests to identify true trends in demand.

"The human brain is trained to, or the human drivers are sort of in subconsciously, they slow down when they go downhill in those slopes. The autonomous vehicle doesn't necessarily have to do that if it's safe... But we learned that this is a more natural driving experience and this is what our riders would also expect in terms of the experience. So that's something that we then modify the behavior on."  Tactical:  Identify gaps where technically 'correct' behavior feels 'unnatural' to users.Modify system behavior to align with the subconscious habits and expectations of users.

"we were worried about certain sellers not being able to meet the demand that they were seeing.

Tactical:  Interview users who churned or failed to complete registration to find the 'why' behind the failure.

"We created this new channel, private channel called Concerning Tweets, and it just, we're this small group of us that Dylan can drop us in. And these are tweets that aren't going viral, by any means. They're just things that you see is with one like, sometimes zero likes, but he feels there's an essence of truth to them and we make sure that we look at what's going on there and see if there isn't something much bigger that we should be focusing on."

"I definitely look everywhere trying to constantly ingest information about Figma, and it's not just Twitter/X, whatever that's called now, but anywhere on the internet, support channels, et cetera. And I'm always trying to understand. I also ask a lot of questions and I try to get to root problems and understand where people are coming from and what are they actually trying to solve. Sometimes people are saying, 'Hey, I need X', but they really want Y or Z."  Tactical:  Monitor non-traditional channels like social media and support forums to ingest broad feedbackAsk follow-up questions to uncover the 'Y or Z' problem behind a user's request for 'X'

"Membership... we need to have a deep, genuine, ongoing relationship with them. And on day one, that may be air quote, 'customer success.' ... On day 37, that might be, 'I have a bug.' ... And on day 58, that may be, 'Hey, we're shipping the mobile app soon. What do you want from mobile?' Other companies view that as different orgs and disciplines. We view that as, there are a bunch of people at the other end of this that we are serving"  Tactical:  Own the user relationship 'full stack' from first touch to long-term retentionUse the same team for bug reports and feature discovery to maintain context

"First of all, I mentioned we had that survey and so we had really rich feedback.

Tactical:  Focus on the 'why' behind CSAT or NPS ratings to find actionable usability gapsShare visceral customer feedback (videos or quotes) with the team to build emotional investment in quality improvementsConnect usability improvements to business metrics like acquisition and expansion

"One of the mistakes that I see a lot of product managers make is they over index on people who are going to be unhappy with the products they're launching... design it for the bigger number of people who are going to be using it tomorrow. If you have to redo the UI and the Who Moved My Cheese, people will be unhappy, but all the new people are going to be like, 'This is so much easier.'"  Tactical:  Be transparent and authentic when explaining why a change was made, rather than using 'marketing speak'.Give users a choice or a transition period when sunsetting features to make them feel heard.
