Problem Definition  Problem definition is the most foundational product skill. Getting this wrong means building the wrong thing, no matter how well you execute. Great problem definition requires deep customer empathy, resisting the urge to jump to solutions, and the discipline to distinguish between business problems and genuine customer pain points.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 91 experts.

1 Start with the struggling moment, not the solution  Demand is created by specific moments where customers struggle. Your job is to find these moments and understand the context that makes seemingly irrational behavior rational. Don't start with technology capabilities or features you want to build. Start by documenting the exact situations where customers feel stuck.

Featured guest perspectives

"But the real thing that if you start to study causality is that a struggling moment causes demand. And you start to realize that in some cases that struggling moment exists and can exist for a long time and nobody solved it."

— Bob Moesta    "Problems create categories, and you either have to A, solve a new problem, or B, reframe, name and claim an existing problem in a... very different way. And if you reframe the existing problem such that people see it in a different way, that's when they'll be open to a new solution."

— Christopher Lochhead    "Spend more time on the problem than the solution."

— Christopher Lochhead        2 Distinguish customer problems from business problems  Not all problems are created equal. A 'business problem' (we need more revenue) is different from a 'customer problem' (I can't find what I need). Always qualify what type of problem you're solving. If you start with a business problem, ask 'why' repeatedly until you find the underlying customer problem causing it.

Featured guest perspectives

"I don't know that we even talk about problems without a qualifier. Are we talking about a business problem? Are we talking about a customer problem? Are we talking about an efficiency problem? Describe the nature of the problem and parse it out."

— Christopher Miller    "The best founders early on trust their engineering teams and product development teams to solve problems and more clearly present a problem to them... Why should we build an iOS app, while the actual problem to solve is we want to increase the percentage of people using a service to five times a week versus two times a week."

— Gokul Rajaram        3 Go watch customers, don't just ask them  Customers often can't articulate their real problems because they're too close to see them. Watch them work. Have them share their screen. Look for manual workarounds, repetitive tasks, and moments of frustration. The best problems to solve are the ones users don't even know they have because they've normalized the pain.

Featured guest perspectives

"You can't actually ask them how difficult is it to do X, y, z because they won't even know that it's that difficult to them. So the best thing I've learned about how to discover the pain is to watch people, have them screen share, have them walk you through their daily workflow."

— Gustaf Alstromer    "I said, there's nothing better in learning how to solve a problem than trying to solve the problem. You will get all the answers, the research, the failure, the mistakes, all the evidence. You know the difference between what people say, this is what they do."

— Christian Idiodi        4 Define the problem with quantified specificity  A vague problem statement leads to vague solutions. Get specific about who has the problem, how often they encounter it, and how painful it is. Quantify where possible. A problem that affects 10% of users 10 times per day is very different from one that affects 80% of users once a month.

Featured guest perspectives

"The first two things are the things that are hardest to define, like who's the customer? ... Then what is the specific problem you were solving? Ideally, you would some way have quantify that problem or there's some data or customer insights that have led you to understand that problem, to know that it is a meaningful and big problem."

— Bill Carr    "You can't stop until you get to the end... so much value is lost when the person in the execution role isn't really in command of all the details... you can't avoid the details, you just have to get into them."

— Ayo Omojola        5 Use Jobs to Be Done to understand the full context  The Jobs to Be Done framework forces you to think about the customer's entire life context, not just the moment they're in your product. What were they doing before? What are they trying to achieve in the larger sense? What emotional needs does the solution satisfy? This prevents building features that technically work but don't fit the customer's actual job.

Featured guest perspectives

"The canonical version of it encourages you to think about the context in which the user's operating or the other things outside of your product that they might be going through."

— Brian Tolkin    "If you think about the higher level job to be done, I was like, 'No, the real issue is that it's super hard to find my stuff, organize my stuff, share my stuff, and secure my stuff.' In the beginning that was like my stuff was my files... Now, the stuff is tabs in my browser, and cloud tools."

— Drew Houston        6 Solve before you scale  In zero-to-one work, resist the temptation to think about scale before you've actually solved the problem. Be comfortable with chaos and wide pivots during the discovery phase. Attempting to scale prematurely locks you into a local maximum. Focus on finding the right problem first, then figure out how to scale the solution.

Featured guest perspectives

"I've repeatedly learned that when you're doing something new, zero-to-one, the temptation is to kind of think about... go to scale before solve. So I've always said to my teams solve before scale."

— Aparna Chennapragada    "The hard part now is, now it's easy to build the thing. Now it's, 'What the hell should we build? Can we clearly articulate what it is we want to build?' And then, 'Can we just have the taste to know, is this right, is this correct?'"

— Eric Simons

✗ Common Mistakes

Starting with a technology or feature in mind and searching for a problem to justify itAccepting a vague problem statement like 'users want X feature' without digging into the underlying needConfusing business problems (we need more revenue) with customer problems (I can't find what I need)Asking customers what they want instead of observing what they actually doTrying to scale a solution before validating that you're solving the right problem     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

You can describe the specific struggling moment that creates demand for your productCross-functional teams are aligned on the problem before discussing solutionsCustomer research reveals insights that surprise the team rather than just confirming assumptionsYour problem statement is specific enough that you can measure whether you've solved itUsers describe their pain in terms that match your problem definition

"I went from wanting to curse Rick out for making me drive 15 minutes to come pick him up to feeling like, all right, no, no, no, there's real value I'm providing you in driving him just two minutes. But I recognized that wasn't embedded in the structure of paying."  Tactical:  Engage in 'dogfooding' in the real world (e.g., driving for the service) to understand the friction points of your users.Look for cases where the product provides value but the business model fails to capture or compensate for it.    "For me, it's a person who is just on the cusp of taking the action you want to take... I like to go to the worst. It shows me everything that's wrong, but the marginal user thinking helps you prioritize what thing to do next."  Tactical:  Identify the 'worst-case' user (e.g., low-end device, poor connection) to see all product flaws simultaneously.Prioritize fixes for the marginal user by removing barriers that are within your immediate control to resolve.

Aishwarya Naresh Reganti + Kiriti Badam 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"In all this advancements of the AI... one easy, slippery slope is to keep thinking about complexities of the solution and forget the problem that you're trying to solve. When you're trying to start at a smaller scale of autonomy, you start to really think about what is the problem that I'm trying to solve and how do I break it down into levels of autonomy that I can build later?"  Tactical:  Break down complex problems into progressive levels of autonomy.Resist the urge to build high-complexity solutions before the problem is fully understood.    "80% of so called AI engineers, AIPMs spend their time actually understanding their workflows very well. They're actually in the weeds understanding their customer's behavior and data. And whenever a software engineer who's never done AI before, here's the term, look at your data. I think it's a huge revelation to them, but it's always been the case."  Tactical:  Spend significant time 'in the weeds' analyzing existing customer workflows and data before building.Map out hierarchical taxonomies and edge cases in enterprise data that might confuse an agent.

"I asked RPM at Replit, Aman Mathur who's a fan of the show to tell me what PMs like to build. And so he came up with a prompt. He kind of really crafted a great prompt... basically, what we're asking for is we want to build a web application... for product managers to track feature requests on a public dashboard."  Tactical:  Define the specific tech stack (e.g., Node.js).List core features clearly (e.g., voting system, status tracking).Specify user personas (e.g., public dashboard for community, admin controls for PMs).

"Don't think about agentic user. Let's say Lenny, 30 years old, doing A, B, C things... His relationship with this category of food delivery is X. These are the things that he has done in the last month. In the last three days, there were the needs, desires, aspirations, fears, frustrations, et cetera, et cetera. We say, 'Okay. It's 11:00. What's happened? Why is this user open, or what triggered this particular app, and then what happened?'"  Tactical:  Plot out the user's emotional state during 'waiting' periods (e.g., the 30 minutes after ordering food).Create a 'wall' that shows the entire end-to-end journey including marketing triggers and every pixel of the UI.

"We have a meeting called OPA, which stands for opportunity/problem, assessment. And so, what this is, it's a meeting where basically PMs... debate and discuss with each other and spar around either areas and problems that they want to go investigate or after they've gotten data back or research back from evaluating an opportunity."  Tactical:  Create a safe space for PMs to debate problems without senior leadership judgment.Use OPA meetings to decide whether to move from investigation to solution development.

"Explaining exactly what you expect and what you're not getting is even more important with AI than with the humans. So I'm going into hooking up more of the actual functionality, but first I'll actually show you something. What's the fastest way to change what went wrong, it's created buttons that say book now and I want them to say, 'Buy now.'"  Tactical:  Avoid vague feedback like 'it doesn't work'Clearly define the delta between expected and actual results    "The big learning is that you have to start with how is this product working end-to-end and then add AI or think where should we add AI? So that was a big learning for me that you really want to see what does the big picture of the user, what's the big picture of how do you think the user experience should be?"  Tactical:  Define the end-to-end user experience before selecting AI toolsAvoid 'novelty' AI features that don't solve a core user pain point

Aparna Chennapragada 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I've repeatedly learned that when you're doing something new, zero-to-one, the temptation is to kind of think about... go to scale before solve. So I've always said to my teams solve before scale. So what that does mean is there's a different posture and different mode when you're trying to solve a problem versus scaling something that's either post-product market fit or even at least in roughly in the ballpark."  Tactical:  Adopt a 'solve before scale' mindset for new productsBe comfortable with wide pivots and 'chaos' during the discovery phaseAvoid prematurely fixing on a 'local hill' or specific solution before the problem is solved

"You can't stop until you get to the end... so much value is lost when the person in the execution role isn't really in command of all the details... you can't avoid the details, you just have to get into them."  Tactical:  Ask 'tedious' questions about data fields and database null values to find hidden optimizations.Re-measure and re-instrument metrics from scratch when starting an optimization project.Challenge 'expert' advice by asking for the specific contractual or regulatory consequence of a decision.

"PPS framework that I talk about a lot, which is problem, people and system. So, whenever there's a challenge that comes up... I like to first say what's the problem? Who are the people involved and what system does it impact? Usually because people just jump straight to the system."  Tactical:  When a request for a tool comes in, pause and ask 'What is the discrete issue you are trying to solve?'Identify all people impacted by a potential system change before implementing it.

Bangaly Kaba 1 quote

"First you have to really understand from first principles what is actually going on. So understand, identify, execute. So when we talk about understand work, there's a few ways to think about it. One is, it is an intentional affordance in your execution to do the work that helps you to de-risk a project and to learn what's going on."  Tactical:  Create parallel paths in every sprint: execution for high-conviction items and 'understand work' for de-risking future items.Include cross-functional partners (marketing, GTM, data science) in 'understand work' to identify hidden gaps.

"I try to encourage the product managers to what's the problem with the thing? And then let us solve it. Don't jump to it and tell us... Don't tell us this is just exactly what we're supposed to do."  Tactical:  Avoid drawing specific UI solutions for designers; instead, define the 'basketball court' of constraints they should operate within.

"We connect people with complex conditions... with their own health advocate... we want to close the gap between patients and the healthcare system. There's this critical layer of the system that's missing, I think, people are navigating life-threatening or debilitating conditions largely with Google."  Tactical:  Identify where users feel 'alone' or 'isolated' despite interacting with a professional system.Look for systemic gaps where practitioners are overworked and cannot provide the advocacy users need.

Tactical:  Identify the specific context that makes a user's seemingly irrational behavior rational.Focus on 'context and outcomes' rather than just 'pain and gain'.    "And so that's what we mean when we're customer-centric is that we're studying the struggling moments they have and people like Intercom and Basecamp, they look at struggling moments and that becomes their roadmap."  Tactical:  Use struggling moments as the primary input for the product roadmap.

Ideally, you would some way have quantify that problem or there's some data or customer insights that have led you to understand that problem, to know that it is a meaningful and big problem."  Tactical:  Define the specific customer segment (e.g., which types of restaurants in which cities)Quantify the problem to ensure it is meaningful enough for customers to pay for a solution    "I would argue this is a case where we made the mistake of what we had a technology solution in mind, which was 3D effects. And then we took that solution and we're then in search of a problem. I don't think it solved any meaningful problems for customers."  Tactical:  Audit failed products by asking: 'What specific customer problem did this solve?'

"The canonical version of it encourages you to think about the context in which the user's operating or the other things outside of your product that they might be going through."  Tactical:  Define the problem within the broader context of the user's life (e.g., moving houses, not just getting an offer)Distinguish between business goals (getting an offer) and true customer jobs (price discovery)    "Product is finding the kernel of truth in a sea of ambiguity and signals... what is noise? What is a good idea, what is a suggestion and what is back to the jobs to be done for what is really going to move the customer forward?"  Tactical:  Filter feedback through the lens of 'what will move the customer forward'Be comfortable saying no to good ideas that aren't the 'kernel' of the problem

Tactical:  Ask 'why should a customer give this the time of day?' compared to the non-digital alternativeAvoid 'me-too' products that just copy existing digital incumbents    "The original framing was one click comment... we needed a one-click comment. That's where the concept came from."  Tactical:  Define the core friction point (e.g., 'one-word comments') before designing the solution    "Competing Against Luck, which was the book that produced Jobs to be Done, which is a framework I really believe in."

Tactical:  Reframe an existing problem to make people open to a new solution.Focus on the problem set before defining the solution set.    "Spend more time on the problem than the solution."  Tactical:  Listen to customers to hear their perspective on the problem rather than just pitching your solution.

"Usually a successful pivot gets warmer instead of colder from what you're an expert at and somehow builds on what you learned on the prior idea. Right? ... A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you're an expert at."  Tactical:  When pivoting, look for problems that leverage your existing expertise or lessons from the previous failed ideaAvoid pivoting into 'fashionable' spaces where you have no unique insight

"This idea of getting unstuck and turning maybe some abstract ideas or some concepts that you've been discussing, turning that into a concrete prototype, something that you can look at and you can click around and you can actually try. It works in a lot of different contexts."  Tactical:  Convert abstract discussions into a clickable prototype to gain clarity.Use prototypes to find out if you are on the right track before spending months on development.    "The first phase, the basics, as I mentioned, that's identifying who's your customer, what problem are you solving for the customer?"  Tactical:  Identify the most important customer first.Define the specific problem the customer is facing that the product intends to solve.    "I think that problem can be really interesting because when teams sit down and think about it, it is often less clear than they thought what the actual problem is."  Tactical:  Have each team member write down the problem independently to reveal misalignments.

"I look at the underlying incentives of the customer. And the underlying incentives of customers are not always financial. Sometimes it's ego, sometimes it's career growth. If you're selling enterprise software to someone, there's an executive sponsor as an example, that person needs to trust that you're going to do a good job for them."  Tactical:  Identify the executive sponsor's personal incentives (e.g., career growth, trust)Align the product's value proposition with the buyer's internal urgency    "We ordered just a bunch of food from these places, and we got a restaurant supplier to give us a base catalog, and we just matched up how much does the ham weigh? How much does the cheese weigh? How much does the bread weigh?... we tried to actually just compose our own independent view of what's the ingredients cost versus what's the labor cost?"  Tactical:  Perform 'bottom-up' research to understand customer unit economics (e.g., weighing ingredients)Compare independent data against customer claims to find hidden insights

"Understanding and defining what problem matters is the most important skill that I think I've taken away, and it applies to so many things. It can apply to a specific product we're building. It can apply to what a company's mission is. I think I've found it really effective because it affects pretty much everything."  Tactical:  Ask 'what problem are we solving?' to resolve debates between different product features or technical abstractions.Use the problem definition to guide business model decisions (e.g., free vs. paid based on the target user's constraints).

"Go and see. Right? So to look at the thing and then walk all the way to ground and talk with the engineer who's writing the code on the thing. Because inevitably this top-level communication is insufficient to get to the detail of what matters and doesn't matter."  Tactical:  Talk directly to the engineers writing the code to understand the reality of the projectDon't rely solely on top-level status updates which often miss critical details    "The person with the product thing has to get into those same weeds first to really understand it... what's the point of writing a document if you don't know what you're talking about?"  Tactical:  Study the 'textbooks' or primary regulations of your domain personallySpend at least half your time becoming a world expert in the product's specific details

"we're going to be focused on users and people in the real world and their problems. And the first step is to understand their problems and then understand if there's an opportunity here as opposed to, 'Hey, you want to build X thing for Y person.' So that's the biggest mistake that you really have to unteach and retrain thinking around."  Tactical:  Focus on users and real-world problems before thinking about implementationIdentify the opportunity space before committing to a specific startup or feature ideaUntrain the instinct to lead with 'I want to build X'

"There is something called the shiny object trap, and I'm always telling people, "Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI." Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way."  Tactical:  Identify the problem and high-level solution before determining the implementation technology.Focus on the 'why' before the 'how' when integrating AI.    "It helps me create user segments in a fantastic way. It will think of user segments that your mind wouldn't even go there, it just wouldn't go there. And it will provide the motivations, it will provide the pinpoints and you just come up with ideas as you read it."  Tactical:  Use ChatGPT to generate a list of potential user segments for a specific product category.Ask AI for the specific motivations and pain points of niche user groups to spark product ideas.    "I usually say that the generalist PM helps their team and their company build and ship the right product. But the AI PM helps their team or company solve the right problem."  Tactical:  Shift focus from 'shipping features' to 'solving problems' when working with data scientists.Evaluate if a problem has enough data behind user behavior to be improved with AI.

"People don't buy the problem, they buy your solution. Obviously they don't buy it if it's not solving something they care about, but there are many products that are solving what they care about. The real question is, do you solve it better than everybody else so that they buy you? And that's where you need to take time. So this is more like the coaching I give the teams. I tell them, "Look, be careful. If you need to spend a little time on the problem, fine, but don't spend a lot of time because you need to save as much time as possible to come up with the winning solution.""  Tactical:  Limit time spent on problem validation if the problem is already well-understoodAllocate the majority of discovery time to finding a winning solution    "In a real product team, first of all, instead of being given a roadmap of prioritized features, they're given problems to solve. So it might be a customer problem. It could be a company problem, it's all fair, but they're problems to solve."  Tactical:  Request problems to solve from leadership instead of feature listsFocus on customer or company problems as the starting point for team work    "And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given a roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve."  Tactical:  Shift from delivering a roadmap of output to solving a roadmap of problems.Measure success by whether the problem is solved, not whether the feature is shipped.

"How extreme can you take it? You're designing a product. You're trying to come up with a solution. What's the most outrageous version of this along some trait? ... The biggest risk is you didn't see the right choice to begin with. You have these three choices and none of them were right. It's this fourth one that was over in this corner, but you didn't look in that corner."  Tactical:  Temporarily throw away constraints like cost or practicality to see beyond default solutions.Build and test extreme versions (e.g., 'safest' vs. 'fastest') to find the ideal middle ground.    "You have to look at things from an angle that other people might not have seen and for me, and for us, it's the angle of where are the emotional hooks that you're experiencing as you go through your work day... Paul Graham has a word for this. He calls it schlep blindness."  Tactical:  Observe the rhythm of a user's feelings throughout the day to find hidden friction points.Look for manual workarounds (like custom spreadsheets) as signals for product opportunities.

Even at executive levels, teams will have gone off for several months, and they're tackling something, and they'll come back with uncertainty, and they'll say like, "Well, you told me to improve developer experience.""  Tactical:  Define exactly what you mean by broad terms like 'developer experience' (e.g., culture vs. friction in toolchains) before starting work.Ensure executives and teams are aligned on the specific direction to avoid months of wasted effort.

"The problem space and the solutions to the problems space is still a big driver of success in building software companies. What problem are you really solving? And if you believe that the problem space is key, so what problems will predict success?"  Tactical:  Segment the market by department breadth (niche vs. everyone) and workflow frequency (daily vs. monthly).Focus on 'High NI' (High frequency niche) workflows as they are highly profitable and easier to enter than 'everyone' workflows.    "Pick a problem that is materially felt by your customers, pain points that steal their time, their energy, their money, their focus, the inability to afford their leisure. If you can solve those kinds of problems... it's a huge tailwind."  Tactical:  Draw the current average workflow for a customer and compare it to the workflow after using your software; look for 2X to 3X compression.Look for the 'whites of their eyes'—physical signs of excitement or pupils dilating when describing the problem solution.

What exactly are we," like, In the details, right? Not in describing a big problem, in a high level, big potential approach to solving it, but what exactly are we doing here?"  Tactical:  Use the phrase 'I don't understand' to force the team to move from high-level problem statements to specific technical details.Ensure the team is 'not confused' even if they might be 'wrong' about the direction.

"The first thing is we are not going to start something unless we can see the end from the beginning. We’re not going to take a big concept and then say, 'What’s the estimate for this thing?'"  Tactical:  Ensure the team can visualize the completed feature before committing resources.Avoid starting with 'fuzzy' concepts that haven't been sharpened into concrete ideas.    "We narrowed it down to we understand that for our specific customers who are requesting this again and again, it’s more about I need to see empty spaces and in the existing agenda view, I can only see things that are already scheduled and I can’t see free spaces where I could book something. So, we got to that point of what we’re trying to solve here is the empty spaces. So, that’s a good frame."  Tactical:  Narrow a broad feature request (like 'a calendar') down to the specific user struggle (like 'seeing empty spaces').Set boundaries on the problem to prevent scope creep during the shaping phase.    "The PM moves upstream... less busy with, 'How do I get this project to not be in a bad state when it’s getting built?' And they’re way more in, 'How do I understand the business context? How do I narrow down the problem? How do I negotiate back and forth with maybe the CPO who brought this to me to understand where the core of it is?'"  Tactical:  Focus on the 'demand-side'—understanding the customer's struggling moment.Negotiate with stakeholders to find the most valuable 'slice' of a problem to solve.

"If people could get over the idea of reducing friction as a number of goal or reducing the number of clicks or taps to do something, and instead focus on how can I make this simple? How do I prevent people from having to think in order to use my software?"  Tactical:  Prioritize 'Don't Make Me Think' as a design mantraFocus on creating comprehension of 'what is this' and 'what do I do next' over friction reduction    "If your software stops me a second and asks me to make a decision and I don't really understand it, you make me feel stupid. ... if you're causing people to think, in the best case, it's unnecessary use of their biological resources, and in the worst case you've now made them feel bad, emotionally bad."

"I hate Jobs-to-be-Done, I think it is a terrible framework, I think no successful company has ever been built on top of JTBD and if you pick JTBD, you're probably doomed"  Tactical:  Avoid using JTBD for complex products with multiple user types and competing incentives.Focus on systems thinking rather than isolated user 'jobs'.    "The problem with that is it's just too idealistic. And most frameworks are, but this one just takes it up a notch where it's like it's almost meant for people who are so naive about product building and especially product building at scale."  Tactical:  Use JTBD only for early-stage hypothesis testing, not for V2 or V3 scaling decisions.

"I think that the heart of good product is really getting comfortable in the problem space or the opportunity space, really taking the time to frame a problem well, and to really get into what's needed before we jump to solutions."  Tactical:  Distinguish between the problem space and the solution spaceAvoid writing opportunities as solutionsUse an experience map to structure the opportunity space based on the customer journey    "As you move vertically down the tree, your opportunities are getting smaller and smaller, which is really key to helping us unlock a continuous cadence... we can deconstruct it. Maybe I can't find something to watch because I don't know if this show's any good... Now we're getting into an opportunity that we can actually solve."  Tactical:  Break down big problems into smaller sub-opportunitiesFrame opportunities specifically (e.g., 'hard to enter password with remote') rather than vaguely ('easier to use')

"Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love with the problem, and then actually what you're trying to do is engage everyone else to fall in love with the same problem, to go into this journey, into this path and follow your leadership there."  Tactical:  Identify a big problem where the world becomes better if solved.Ensure you aren't the only person with the problem before building.    "When you fall in love with the problem, then what happened is that the problem is going to serve as the North Star of your journey, and when you have a North Star, you're going to make less deviation from the course and you are way more likely to become successful."  Tactical:  Use the problem as a North Star to maintain focus.    "And what I really encourage people is first of all, go and validate the problem, speak with people, understand their perception of the problem. And only then start to think about the solution... when you focus on the problem, then the problem is going to serve as the north star of your journey. And when you have a north star, you're going to make less deviation from the course and increase the likelihood of being successful."  Tactical:  Validate the problem by speaking with people before designing any part of the solution.Look for 'emotional engagement'—if a potential customer says 'I hate that' about a problem, you have found a valid starting point.

And I think that it's not pure art, but if you lose the art and you're just solving the problem, it's totally utilitarian and it lacks soul."

"You have to derive it from first principles. You have to say, 'How would we solve this problem given every fundamental building block that we have available right now?'... everything that you encounter, that every solution, every product, everything that exists is path-dependent, highly, highly, highly path-dependent, and often path-dependent based on having to make compromises, based on things that were true at the time a decision was made but are no longer true."  Tactical:  Identify which assumptions in an existing solution are no longer trueDerive solutions from the fundamental building blocks available todayAvoid 'skipping the exercise' by simply copying how others solve a problem    "The amazing thing about software is we can actually just overtake this piece of complexity. We know what the taxes are everywhere and we are just doing it for you. You don't have to think about taxes. In this case we have someone encountered something that stunned them, that stopped them in their tracks... lowering complexity, making good UX, creating software that just autopilots taxes or payments or any of these kinds of things, fraud, actually causes more entrepreneurship."
