Launch Marketing  Launch marketing determines whether your product gets noticed or dies in obscurity. The best launches create momentum through strategic timing, compelling narratives, and coordinated efforts across channels—treating each launch as a campaign rather than a single announcement.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 26 experts.

1 Build anticipation before the launch  Great launches don't start on launch day—they start weeks or months earlier. Create a waitlist, tease features, and build an audience that's primed and waiting. The goal is to have thousands of people ready to act the moment you go live, rather than starting from zero on launch day.

Featured guest perspectives

"Build an audience first, then release your product to that audience... I've had a lot of success where the product launches to the existing email list, to the existing social following."

— Sahil Bloom    "We didn't launch on Day 1. We spent more like six, seven months building up demand... before we even had a product to sell."

— Wes Kao        2 Tell a story, not list features  Your launch narrative should focus on the transformation you enable, not the features you built. Lead with the problem you solve and the outcome users achieve. Features are forgettable; stories about real human impact spread and stick.

Featured guest perspectives

"A pitch is just a story... I always, always want to start with insight. Why do I need to pay attention to this? A good pitch has a point of view."

— April Dunford    "Build the narrative around the announcement before anything else... Have a conversation with the user. Anticipate their questions. Treat it like a dialogue."

— Lulu Cheng Meservey        3 Coordinate launch across multiple channels simultaneously  A single blog post isn't a launch—it's a whisper. Effective launches hit multiple channels at once: Product Hunt, press outreach, social media, email, and community posts. This creates the perception of being 'everywhere' and generates compounding momentum.

Featured guest perspectives

"Launches are actually not just one thing, they're really a campaign... multiple things happening at the same time."

— Anthony Pierri    "They're executing across every single channel consistently... they kept launching small things every single day... they made it feel like they're everywhere."

— Hiten Shah        4 Nail Product Hunt with community and timing  Product Hunt can drive significant early traffic if executed well. Hunt on Tuesday through Thursday, rally your community to upvote and comment authentically, and have founders actively engage in the comments. A top-5 finish opens doors to press, investors, and early adopters.

Featured guest perspectives

"Tap into an existing audience... Coordinate with known personalities in your space... Make sure you have a really good answer to 'What makes us different?'"

— Amanda Natividad    "Something happens every time we hit Product Hunt, a lot of people see it and we have two weeks of extra people coming to the site."

— David Thacker        5 Treat launch as a repeatable motion, not a one-time event  The best companies launch constantly—new features, milestones, integrations, and customer stories all become launch opportunities. Each launch compounds on the last, building brand awareness and giving you regular practice at the launch motion.

Featured guest perspectives

"Make it a motion, the companies that are really good are the ones that are constantly launching... it compounds over time."

— Anthony Pierri    "Always be launching. If you aren't releasing something new or talking about something new every month, you're already behind."

— Joanna Lord

✗ Common Mistakes

Launching without an existing audience and expecting organic discoveryTreating launch as a single announcement rather than a coordinated campaignLeading with features instead of the problem you solveWaiting for the 'perfect' moment instead of launching and iterating     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

You have a waitlist or audience primed before launch dayMultiple channels show activity simultaneously during launchPeople can articulate why your product matters in one sentenceEach launch generates more momentum than the last

Arielle Jackson 3 quotes

"For early stage startups, we're almost always running the launch announcement as an exclusive, which means you give the news to a single outlet. And they're the only ones who get to write about it."  Tactical:  Identify a single target outlet that covers companies at your specific stagePrepare the website for traffic before the launch announcement    "Don't do a straight funding announcement. A lot of founders raise money and they're like, cool, let's announce. It's like, no, we'll use that funding announcement as a news hook to tell a larger story and a larger story might be your products available. You have reference customers, you have momentum."  Tactical:  Combine funding news with a product launch or partnership announcementFocus on making the story interesting to the outlet's readers, not just the company    "Don't sleep on local press. If you have a local business or a local story or local customers... We turned all of our customers into heroes and went after local press."  Tactical:  Pitch local outlets by highlighting how the business helps local heroes or customersTie the company story to local trends like hiring or economic shifts

"I'm a big believer in comms. ... I think that there are very few and far between incredible megaphones for what it is that you or your company is doing where you get to reach such a breadth of people with that stamp of credibility and notice. How do you get somebody to say, 'Hey, this is really something you should pay attention to.'?"  Tactical:  Maintain straightforward, accessible relationships with the pressLeverage credible journalists to provide a third-party endorsement of your product's value

"With satellite imagery, it honestly wasn't the most important part of Google Maps, but it was the sizzle to the steak and it created... a viral moment."  Tactical:  Identify a 'sizzle' feature that generates buzz even if it isn't the primary use case    "Biz [Stone] was really focused on getting celebrities and public figures onto Twitter... we were exclusively focused on polishing the product... we totally lost for no reason related to product at all."  Tactical:  Prioritize distribution and 'people worth following' over pure product polish in social/networked products    "I think because product-led growth became very popular... if PLG means that you aren't actually engaging with the buyer of your software, you're not going to grow."  Tactical:  Use direct sales when the buyer (e.g., Finance) is different from the user (e.g., Employee)Use developer-led GTM for platform products where engineers have purchasing latitude

Christine Itwaru 2 quotes

"There's the knowing something's coming and then there's the knowing what to do with it. You can use just some status keeping thing to say, 'This is coming in Q4'... but it's what to do with it and how to position it and how to talk about it and all the things that was missing from it."  Tactical:  Move beyond simple status updates to provide 'readiness' guidance for internal teamsEnsure every major launch includes specific instructions on how to position the new value to customers    "Treating content is a part of the development lifecycle process. You really want to treat it as a part of definition of done. When you think about product-led growth... it's all about creating that experience and keeps people in and helps them upgrade."  Tactical:  Include the creation of in-app guides or educational content in the feature development checklistWork with product marketing to develop playbooks for driving engagement through in-app content

Chris Hutchins 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"launching with two or three episodes, either all at once or in a week is a really valuable strategy... the ranking charts are all driven by different variables than you would imagine. They're driven a lot by momentum of new subscribers."  Tactical:  Launch with multiple pieces of content simultaneously to build early momentumFocus on driving a high volume of new subscribers in a short window to spike rankings

Christopher Lochhead 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"What if you did that as a software company? What if you launched a thing... the way Hollywood launches a movie? ... the idea of a lightning strike is, if you are in our target audience for that day or that two days, we are going to be all over you. ... I'd rather matter for one week a year than be irrelevant for the rest of the year."  Tactical:  Execute 1-2 massive 'lightning strike' events per year to create undeniable presence.Focus all marketing efforts on being unavoidable to your target audience for a short window.

Claire Butler 2 quotes

"The way I think about it now is this bottoms-up motion, that really is focused on ICs... they love you so much that they're willing to put their social capital and themselves in the line and spread the product throughout whatever their communities are. And the one that's connected the most to revenue is companies."  Tactical:  Focus initial adoption efforts on practitioners (ICs) rather than executive buyersEnable users to leverage their social capital to spread the product internally    "We wanted to see was that designers were excited when they saw the tool... I remember they would take the laptop out of Dylan's hands when he would start showing it because they wanted to play with it. And to me, when I started seeing designers do that... that kind of emotion, no reaction of wanting to play with it in these demos was really what gave me confidence that we were ready to launch."  Tactical:  Look for 'pull' signals where users physically want to interact with the product during demosLaunch when you have enough features to sustain full-time use for at least a small group

"We're already seeing some really exciting use cases, virtual production for movies... robotic simulation... a psychologist team called us to use Marble to do psychology research. It turned out some of the psychiatric patients they study, they need to understand how their brain respond to different immersive things... Marble is a really almost instantaneous way of getting so many of these experimental environments into their hands."  Tactical:  Release early versions to see how different industries (VFX, healthcare, gaming) adapt the tool.Look for 'delightful' features (like visualization dots) that help users understand and connect with the technology.

Emilie Gerber 3 quotes

"When we pitch a funding story, we make it very clear, 'Hey, we're reaching out with a startup launch or funding. We're offering this to you as an exclusive, meaning we're not going to pitch anyone else if you take the story. Here's the amount that's raised, here's the space that... Here's the space they're in and here are the investors.'"  Tactical:  Offer the story as an exclusive to one reporter at a timeInclude the amount raised, the industry space, and the lead investors in the initial pitch    "I highly recommend not having a firm date that you think you need to announce something and going instead with when a reporter is able to cover your story... if you can optimize for the reporter over the timing, you're going to see such a better outcome."  Tactical:  Prioritize reporter availability over internal launch deadlinesAvoid issuing press releases on a rigid date if no coverage is secured    "I would say before an announcement happens, you probably want to kick off six weeks in advance. So when we start with the company, it's like we're working on the blog, we're doing a media training, we're doing the media outreach, we're getting quotes from investors."  Tactical:  Start PR prep 6 weeks before the target announcement dateCoordinate investor quotes and media training early in the process

Emily Kramer 1 quote

"This is a marketing brief that I recommend you do before you make anything big in marketing or do any big projects. And it's just what are the goals? What's the audience? What's the creative or unique end goal? What's this thing? I guess what's going to make it different and stand out from other companies? The second C is the channels or how this is going to be distributed. How are you going to get the word out about this? Deep thinking there. And then the last few are the stakeholders."  Tactical:  Complete a GACCS brief for every major launch or campaign.Share the brief with product stakeholders early to get buy-in on messaging and distribution channels.

Geoffrey Moore 2 quotes

"The Crossing the Chasm model is, 'Can you create a viable repeatable business?' And in order to do that, you need to have an ecosystem of partners work with you in order to consolidate your position. Well, why would an ecosystem work with some startup that nobody's ever heard of? The answer would be if you had consolidated a market segment where you were number one."  Tactical:  Focus on a single beachhead segment to become the 'big fish' that partners want to support.Prioritize market share in a niche over broad, shallow adoption.    "In the early market, you know you're there because first of all, the story is the technology... In the bowling alley one then the playbook is, 'No, where's the problem?'... In the tornado... this is when you do want sales coverage, and you do want to go broad."  Tactical:  Use a 'project model' for visionaries and a 'solution model' for pragmatists.Shift to horizontal sales coverage only once the market enters the 'tornado' phase.

"We found that just translating it with AI was able to get performance almost as good as the original, in the original language. So this is going to fly to the entire market."  Tactical:  Use AI to localize ad creative into multiple languages for global GTM without rebuilding from scratch.Iterate on dozens of AI-generated ad variations to find the highest-performing creative through performance channels.Monitor user comments on AI ads to gauge when the technology has reached 'believability' thresholds for the general public.

Janna Bastow 1 quote

"But one of the other things that you can be doing for your marketing and sales teams is separating your hard launch from your soft launch. So what you should be doing is basically saying your developers are able to launch something on a particular date and it's the date that's convenient for them... When this new thing comes out, that's a soft launch. As soon as that soft launch is out, great, let's kick off this launch meeting with launch steps."  Tactical:  Perform a soft launch first to gather functional videos and testimonials from early usersUse the period between soft and hard launch to plan a high-impact marketing campaign based on the final product

Jason Feifer 1 quote

"Sometimes the point of it is not to reach the people who are reading it at all... Maybe what it really is is to tweet it and then put some money behind promoting that tweet because then you can target that you got coverage to the people who you want to notice you got coverage. And I see a lot of people do that. They'll take articles that we ran on Entrepreneur and they'll basically turn them into advertisements."  Tactical:  Use 'As seen in' logos on your website to build immediate social cachet and validation.Put marketing spend behind social media posts featuring your press coverage to ensure it reaches your specific target audience.

"We were in this private beta stage for almost a year... We invited people based on... We invited more smaller companies using the tools we currently supported. And then also I was trying to see who is more interested versus just, I don't know, I just want to try it out type of people."  Tactical:  Use a waitlist survey to filter for high-intent users in your target segment.Onboard users in small cohorts to avoid being overwhelmed by duplicate feedback on the same bugs.    "With our announcement, we wrote it more direct or authentic to us like, 'This is what we're going to do and this is why, and these are some of the things we're going to do.' On a Twitter, we did the same thing. All of us founders, we wrote our own reasons why we're doing this, and I think it was just much more... I think people like us could resonate more with it."  Tactical:  Have each founder share their personal 'why' for building the company during the launch.Target the initial announcement at the specific community where your early adopters spend time (e.g., Twitter/X).

"We tried to get it all at once. It was a new blockchain. It was a basket of currencies originally. It was integration into WhatsApp and Messenger... I think the whole world kind of went like, 'Oh my God, that's a lot of change at once.' ... introduced the change a little bit more gently, maybe still gotten to that same outcome, but fewer new things at once."  Tactical:  Avoid launching multiple 'new-to-the-world' concepts in a single releaseIntroduce changes one at a time to build user and regulator trust

Lulu Cheng Meservey 2 quotes

"If you want to spread something you go out in concentric circles starting from your own desk. So you need to get first really clear with yourself about what your message is and just get really crisp with it... And then the next circle is going to be your co-founders, your executives, your employees, your investors, you go to your power users, and you go out from there, and it has to be in that sequence."  Tactical:  List and rank target audiences (limit to 5-6) by their ability to influence success.Map where each audience 'resides intellectually' (podcasts, subreddits, newsletters).Ensure the inner circle (employees) is fully aligned before moving to the next circle to maintain credibility.    "Give it away for free to the right people. If you can choose the people who are going to love it, look at the Venn diagram of people who are going to be obsessed with this product. And people who have a large following among the other people that you want to get to, whoever falls into that sliver of the Venn diagram shower them with free product."  Tactical:  Identify influencers who fall into the intersection of 'obsessed with the product' and 'followed by the target audience'.Shower this specific 'sliver' of the Venn diagram with free product to generate organic evangelism.

"I'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy."  Tactical:  Test multiple marketing tactics simultaneouslyIdentify which specific action 'sticks' or goes viralDouble down on the winning tactic to form your core strategy    "We hired a bunch of actors. They were doing this event in San Francisco... we got some picket signs at Home Depot and made some signs that said, 'The end of software is near,'... We were running a protest outside of Siebel... we hit a button, and we have other actors in a van who come out, and they are staging themselves as news crew. So they are like KNMS, K No More Software, and we're like... They're interviewing the protesters."  Tactical:  Use 'protest' or counter-narrative messaging to differentiate from incumbentsCreate staged media moments to increase the perceived scale of a movementFocus on being 'remarkable' so people have something to talk about    "I have Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson who are two friends of mine helping me. So they said, 'We'll cut ads for you.'... I'm running aggressive marketing against Microsoft because they have really a terrible product, Copilot, that I have to position against and market against."  Tactical:  Leverage celebrity partnerships for high-visibility ad campaignsDirectly name and position against competitors' weaknessesUse social media (e.g., Twitter) to gather immediate feedback on ad concepts

"Product ops will take on a lot of the coordination of those types of things... making sure that go-to-market process is consistent across the organization so that it's not like... everybody's reinventing the wheel and somebody on a go-to-market team has to figure out how to go-to-market differently with a different product team."  Tactical:  Create standardized GTM templates for product managers to fill outEstablish a consistent cadence for cross-functional GTM reviews

"I think that hype as well is really tied to emotion. So to the extent that a person using a product can feel like, 'Oh, this thing that is built in the product was built for me not to advance the company's goals or anything like that, but to make me feel special, to make me feel happy.'"  Tactical:  Use Easter egg hunts or 'birthday presents' in-product to drive engagement during milestonesAlign hype strategies with the specific brand personality of the product (e.g., 'cheeky' for FigJam)Leverage internal company forums like Sales Kickoffs to build momentum before external launches

Nan Yu 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"With marketing and communication with customers, you basically have a limited amount of opportunities to do so... If you miss one of those opportunities, you don't get it back again. You can't time travel back and say like, 'Okay, actually, let's redo first quarter and say this message that we wish we could have gotten into the field.'"  Tactical:  Respect the rhythm of the calendar (weeks, months, quarters) for major communications.Treat launch dates as critical windows for reaching your audience.

Nikita Bier 1 quote

"I think a lot of founders separate marketing and product growth... but they're both the same. They both should be treated as the same. If you're targeting a community... you need to build marketing that shows imagery of that community... then when you get in the app, you have to be able to join that community."  Tactical:  Align ad creative imagery with the specific communities users will find inside the appEnsure the invitation and onboarding flow mentions the specific community the user is joining

"I would say at least 10 different ad creatives will be ideal per week and the more the better."  Tactical:  Aim to test at least 10 new creatives per week to find what resonates.Use tools like CapCut to generate high volumes of content quickly.    "A broader targeting approach is actually recommended at the very early stage... I can see for the first two years in the business... they want to do a very small niche targeting on the platform because you're limiting yourself."  Tactical:  Avoid niche targeting or heavy remarketing in the first month of a campaign.Allow at least one month for the platform to 'learn' and optimize.

Ryan Hoover 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Launch sometimes doesn't help with that, but there are many other reasons why you might wanna launch. So, customer acquisition one, to get the word out. Another can be recruiting. So, by, you know, sharing your story, getting people excited, it might make it easier to recruit and get people excited about, you know, what you're building. Another is fundraising. Sometimes it can create momentum, you know, as- as other investors, they do read the news and they know that, you know, when this company is more public, they're might be more heat around it- a particular deal. Feedback is one. Um, the feedback from users, feedback just serendipitously and- and sort of another one is partnership."  Tactical:  Use launches to build recruiting momentum and excitement for potential hires.Leverage the public nature of a launch to create 'heat' for fundraising rounds.View launches as a team-building moment to celebrate accomplishments and boost morale.    "Some of the things that I've noticed that make a big difference is we've already talked about the tagline copy, that goes to, not only the post, but also the maker. Usually people tend to add like some introduction, some context. Uh, generally a lot of people will, they- they manufacture PR speak there too, and so speaking like a human, I think, is important. Also keeping it a little brief... another big one is the gallery is- is often the first thing that someone is gonna see once they land on the page. And so, just naturally our eyes gravitate towards visuals. And some of the most interesting presentations I've seen is people use the gallery almost like a slideshow, um, like telling a story, where each slide is- is communicating like a different- well, a story of some sort."  Tactical:  Write the introduction and tagline as a human, not a PR professional.Keep the maker's introduction brief to respect the user's time.Use the image gallery as a narrative slideshow to show 'before and after' or product evolution.

"PR is not going to get you leads or users... What it is good for is credibility... hiring or maybe improving the response rate for your cold outbound. Those are the two that I think make the most sense, because in both cases they have a different distribution mechanism."  Tactical:  Include PR coverage in recruiting emails to increase candidate interestUse press mentions in cold sales outbound to establish trustDon't rely on PR for direct user acquisition    "Instead you can have not just one big launch but a series of launches that allow you to stay top of mind, to create momentum with your users, and to show up in lots of different places because audiences respond to novelty."  Tactical:  Plan a series of launches every few months to stay top of mindUse novelty to re-engage existing communitiesFocus on momentum rather than just one-time press coverage
