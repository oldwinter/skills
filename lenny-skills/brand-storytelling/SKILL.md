Brand Storytelling  Brand storytelling connects your product to a mission larger than features. Stories are memorable in a way that facts and features are not; they inspire teams, build customer loyalty, and create emotional resonance that drives word-of-mouth. The best stories center on transformation, not success, and make the listener feel something.

Read Guide

The Guide  5 key steps synthesized from 30 experts.

1 Start with the story, not the product  Define the product story before finalizing the product itself. A story creates cohesion and helps customers understand the value. When you're working on a launch, figure out the narrative first because the story will often dictate the product.

Featured guest perspectives

"When we're working on a launch, one of the first things we'll do is start figuring out what the story is. And the story will often dictate the product. Because ultimately you have to tell the story to people. But a story also is a really helpful way to develop a cohesive product."

— Brian Chesky        2 Center stories on a moment of transformation  Every effective story is centered on a brief moment of internal change or realization. Identify the 'five-second moment' where a transformation occurs. 98% of the story provides context to make that moment clear. Problem-solving stories beat success stories because they're relatable and actionable.

Featured guest perspectives

"Every story is about a singular moment. I call it five seconds. It's a moment of either transformation, meaning I'm telling you a story about how I once used to be one kind of person and now I'm a new kind of person. Or more common is realization."

— Matthew Dicks    "Success stories are not interesting. They're not interesting to anybody. It's not useful for you to hear that someone else succeeded. What's useful is for you to hear how someone else faced challenges that you faced."

— Jason Feifer        3 Hook the audience immediately with stakes  Stories must establish stakes at the beginning to capture attention. Plant an 'elephant' (a clear problem or goal) in the first sentence. Start with specific location and immediate action to ground the audience. Avoid opening with unattributed dialogue or sound effects.

Featured guest perspectives

"I always say you should have, what I call an elephant at the beginning of the story... We have to immediately know that something is at stakes. We have to be worried about something."

— Matthew Dicks    "Every pitch should start in the middle of the action, like a thriller or like a drama, like Mission Impossible movies always start with Tom cruise doing some crazy shit in the middle of the job right before the job that the actual movie is about because it gets your attention."

— Merci Grace        4 Make stories memorable and repeatable  The goal is to make people want to retell your story. Turn ideas into repeatable jokes, colorful mental images, or concrete anecdotes that people can share at a dinner table. Replace subjective adjectives with specific stories that provide social currency to the teller.

Featured guest perspectives

"The overall principle is you have to make it memorable and you have to make people want to say it of their own volition... You can make it into a joke... You can use an analogy... You can create a mental image that is very colorful... use a story, use an anecdote instead of using adjectives."

— Lulu Cheng Meservey        5 Build your brand into the product itself  Brand storytelling should be embedded directly into the product UI and interactions, not just external marketing. Prioritize 'love marks' and unique micro-interactions that communicate the brand's personality. The emotional feel of the software differentiates in a crowded utility market.

Featured guest perspectives

"I talk to my designer all the time, how can we add more love marks into the product? How can we prioritize more unique interactions? The little elements that make up that feeling of this product is speaking to me... we put all of the brand work actually into our product."

— Elena Verna    "I think for us, we invested a lot in our brand across multiple areas. And I think one specific area that I think is really important is that you create consistency across all customer touchpoints. And so branding is not just cool logo, cool advertising, fun imagery, but it's really about the impression that a customer or user has with your product."

— Kevin Aluwi

✗ Common Mistakes

Telling success stories instead of problem-solving storiesStarting stories with a company intro rather than in the middle of the actionUsing adjectives instead of concrete, retellable anecdotesTreating brand as an afterthought separate from product     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Customers and employees describe the mission in emotionally resonant termsYour brand stories get retold by others in their own wordsThe product experience feels emotionally cohesive with the external marketingTeam members feel connected to a larger purpose through the narrative

"This structure really is about defining a movement, and that's very different from, 'Hey, I'm going to solve your problem.'"  Tactical:  Frame your brand as the leader of a movement toward a new way of winning.    "The third piece is what I call naming the object of the new game... I find that what's the object of the new game really boils it down as kind of the rallying cry of the movement. So the example with Zuora, the object for a while was turn customers into subscribers."  Tactical:  Create a 'buyer mission statement' or rallying cry (e.g., Airbnb's 'Belong Anywhere').Try framing the object of the game as a question to engage the prospect.

"what we want to do then is, okay, we've got this positioning, now let's put it together into a sales narrative that we can then take and test with qualified prospects and make sure it works, but we've also got something that the sales team can pitch and oh, by the way, everybody else knows how to tell the story too."

I like to think of it as we exist to blank."  Tactical:  Draft a purpose statement starting with 'We exist to...'List cultural tensions in the world to find a relevant purposeEnsure the purpose is independent of financial gain    "Strong brand spike in two of the five [dimensions]... sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication, and ruggedness... you want to write them as statements that say we are X, but not Y, where Y is taking X too far.

Tactical:  Select two of the five dimensions of brand personality to focus onCreate five 'X but not Y' personality attributes to create healthy tensionUse these attributes to guide ad copy and illustration styles

"This actually comes from Pixar. The way Pixar actually does its films is it has to come back with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, statements around it... It's this notion of once upon a time... every day... one day... because of that... until finally... and ever since that day."  Tactical:  Structure your career summary using the 'Once upon a time...

"painting an emotional picture of the vision that he was really going after and being able to convey the emotional quality of the mission to the people he talked to.

Emilie Gerber 2 quotes

Tactical:  Identify the 'nugget' of the story that is most interesting to the general publicTie product news to current events or industry-wide problems    "Having something pretty controversial to say... we really push our clients to have something unique and different and bold to say.

Tactical:  Take a stance that opposes a popular trend if it's strategically soundPitch 'gaps' in current coverage by offering a different perspective

Grant Lee 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"I think part of founder-led marketing is going through this yourself. I think a lot of founders are trying to be more active on social media. And I think if you can overcome the initial cringe factor of seeing yourself and postings like, oh, this doesn't feel authentic, if you can overcome that initial feeling, you start investing into like, okay, how do I become a better copywriter? How do I articulate something that is clear, not just clever?"  Tactical:  Practice copywriting to ensure communication is clear rather than just clever.Bank 'goodwill' by sharing valuable content for a long time before asking for anything in return.Keep a log of unintuitive lessons and observations to turn into content.

Gustaf Alstromer 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"Finally, what I would say is the skill that's really attributed to great founders is excellent communication skills. So the ability to communicate really complicated ideas clearly... I would say communication or storytelling is part of the same arc, right? And those are part of the same thing that actually motivates people around you."  Tactical:  Practice communicating complicated technical ideas in clear, simple narratives

Jason Feifer 2 quotes

Listen to episode →

"Success stories are not interesting. They're not interesting to anybody. It's not useful for you to hear that someone else succeeded. What's useful is for you to hear how someone else faced challenges that you faced. And got through them so that you can see. Aha, that's an interesting strategy to use for me. I hate success stories. I love problem solving stories."  Tactical:  Frame your brand story around a specific problem you faced and the counterintuitive way you solved it.Be open about challenges and vulnerabilities during interviews to build a more compelling 'hero's journey' narrative.    "Sometimes you are not the story, but you can be part of the story. Sometimes that means if Fred stumbled into it, but I get plenty of people who've reach out and maybe they have a real estate startup and there's something really interesting happening in the real estate space and they reach out and they tell me about this really interesting thing that's happening in the real estate space and the role that they happen to play in it."  Tactical:  Identify a 'gigantic scam' or industry-wide problem your company is caught up in and pitch that larger story to journalists.Use your company's internal data to create reports (like the 'Corcoran Report') that establish you as an authority on industry trends.

Jonathan Becker 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"In a pitch situation you want to tell a story, it's important, and that story has to have a beginning, middle, and end... be brave and tell them what they need rather than just conforming to what they're asking for because sometimes inadvertently that leads you down the wrong path."  Tactical:  Structure pitches with a clear beginning, middle, and endIdentify the underlying need of the stakeholder rather than just answering their explicit questions

Karri Saarinen 1 quote

Listen to episode →

"To me, I think the brand should be always authentic and it should, I think even if people can't articulate it, if people start to feel like something is off... you create it over time by the things you do, the things you say, how you say them and how do you approach things, how do you treat customers, how do you build the website or the product?"  Tactical:  Ensure the brand voice is consistent across the product, marketing, and support interactions.Focus on authenticity rather than emulating the brand styles of other successful companies.

Kevin Aluwi 3 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I'm a very big believer that the two most important things in a consumer business are product and brand in that order. And I don't think I need to sell the idea, especially to your audience. That product is absolutely critical and probably the most important. But brand as an afterthought is definitely one of the areas where I think there's a giant missed opportunity for consumer tech businesses."  Tactical:  Prioritize brand as a core pillar alongside product rather than an afterthoughtAim to create associations that transcend transactional relationships to become part of a user's identity    "I think for us, we invested a lot in our brand across multiple areas. And I think one specific area that I think is really important is that you create consistency across all customer touchpoints. And so branding is not just cool logo, cool advertising, fun imagery, but it's really about the impression that a customer or user has with your product and with your business."  Tactical:  Ensure consistency across all customer touchpoints, including in-app copy and advertisingThink of branding as the total impression a user has of the business, not just visual assets    "The jackets and helmets piece I think is really, really important for two reasons. One, the more obvious reason, which is that because they were just all over the streets of many cities in Indonesia, people were familiar with the imagery and the names, but I think it's also really important that people saw what was happening... it was like this beautiful combination of one just having that imagery and having that visual everywhere as a reminder of the brand. But more importantly, it was also a physical reminder of the service of what we do and of how we can help you."  Tactical:  Use physical branding (like uniforms or equipment) to provide a constant visual reminder of the serviceLook for opportunities where branding can physically reinforce the value proposition (e.g., seeing a driver bypass traffic)

"I now reflect back on just how powerful our storytelling was at Airbnb to get people pumped up. I mean, even for some of the smallest features that we would build, Lenny, they would kick off with the most powerful storytelling. I mean, we were changing lives. And again, it makes you wake up every day going, 'Fuck, yeah, I want to work on this.'"  Tactical:  Kick off feature launches with stories that highlight the human impact of the work.Ensure the narrative of 'changing lives' is felt throughout the entire organization.

"Every story is about a singular moment. I call it five seconds. It's a moment of either transformation, meaning I'm telling you a story about how I once used to be one kind of person and now I'm a new kind of person. Or more common is realization. Which is I used to think something and then some stuff happened and now I think a new thing."  Tactical:  Identify the 'five-second moment' where a transformation or realization occurs.Ensure 98% of the story provides the necessary context to make that moment clear.    "The dinner test is the idea that when you're telling a story in a formal way... the story that you're telling should be very closely related to the story you would tell someone if you were having dinner. So there should be no performance art included within your story."  Tactical:  Avoid opening with unattributed dialogue or sound effects (e.g., 'Bang!').Speak in a slightly elevated version of your natural dinner-table voice.    "I always say you should have, what I call an elephant at the beginning of the story... We have to immediately know that something is at stakes. We have to be worried about something."  Tactical:  Plant an 'elephant' (a clear problem or goal) at the very beginning.Use a 'backpack'—tell the audience your plan so they can worry when it goes wrong.Use 'breadcrumbs' to drop hints about future developments.Use an 'hourglass' to slow down time during the most critical moments.Use a 'crystal ball' to predict a false or frightening future to increase tension.    "I just decided every day before I go to bed, I'm going to look back on the day and find one moment that would've been worth telling as a story. Even if it wasn't really worth telling, I was going to write it down. Now I don't write the whole thing down. That's crazy. It's not doable. What I do is I took an Excel spreadsheet, two columns, the date, and then I stretched the B column across."  Tactical:  Spend five minutes every night recording one story-worthy moment from the day.Use a simple spreadsheet with the date and a one-sentence description of the moment.Look for moments of emotional resonance, even if they seem small.    "Start every story you ever tell for the rest of your life with those two things. So you start with location, where are you? Location activates imagination... and you start with action, meaning something needs to be happening right away."  Tactical:  Begin the story by stating exactly where you are.Ensure the first sentence involves an action to create momentum.

Merci Grace 3 quotes

Listen to episode →

"I think one of the things that is quite obvious from the get-go... is how different really great CEOs and startup leaders are at storytelling, at coming up with a pithy answer, at owning the room. The fundamentals of their businesses might not even look a lot better, but when you're in that room, you feel so differently about it."  Tactical:  Focus on owning the room and delivering pithy, memorable answers during pitches.    "Every pitch should start in the middle of the action, like a thriller or like a drama, like Mission Impossible movies always start with Tom cruise doing some crazy shit in the middle of the job right before the job that the actual movie is about because it gets your attention."  Tactical:  Start your pitch or presentation in the middle of the action to capture immediate attention.Avoid starting with boring market slides; backfill context later.    "If you are going to say that you're the only founder that could start this company, or you have this really unique insight, start there. Even though it feels like you haven't built up to it yet, or anything like that, you don't have to, you'll backfill all of that later."  Tactical:  Lead with your unique founder insight immediately in the deck.

"The storytelling primitive ends up working spectacularly well for startups, right? We need to describe the world that is, we need to describe the world that could be... your job as the founder is to be Obi-Wan, not Luke."  Tactical:  Describe the 'world that is' (the current pain/status quo)Describe the 'world that could be' (the transformed future)Position your product as the 'lightsaber' or tool the hero needs to succeedToggle back and forth between the current state and the future state to create tension    "A movement is a way to crystallize the choice... The people who followed Martin Luther King bought into the aesthetically better future that his movement promised."  Tactical:  Leverage a grievance of a minority against the 'tyranny' of a majorityAnimate the story so early believers feel emotionally committed to moving to the new future

"First of all, people that's starting, often they are getting a better storytelling journey. Often totally underestimate how many time actually great storytellers are investing in creating the stories and making sure they can share the story in nice ways and formats. So that's maybe the first tip, you have to plan to put in a lot of work to create your story."  Tactical:  Dedicate specific time (e.g., 1-2 hours daily for two weeks) to craft major strategy storiesUse language that speaks to both hearts and mindsRemove business lingo and three-letter abbreviations to avoid 'banner blindness'    "I use this hero's journey a lot where I think about, should I put the team in the heart of the story? Because if it's a story that should help me to motivate the team or to inspire the team to actions or something like that, then maybe it's nice if I put them in the center of the story and make them the heroes and talk about the demons and monsters they have to fight to once arrived at this brighter future."  Tactical:  Cast the team or the user as the hero of the narrativeDefine the 'call to adventure' and the 'bright future' clearlyPrepare the story in three lengths: 75 seconds, 6 minutes, and 18 minutes

"I often talk about memification, which is this idea that I found this out most at Uber, I feel, where there's certain insights, data insights, research insights that were memmified to the point where someone like Travis or Dara would just cite this insight in the middle of a meeting, and you know that you've really done your job as, maybe, a researcher or a data scientist or product manager if people are able to do that and draw from that in that way."  Tactical:  Synthesize disparate observations into a cohesive thesisUse real-world metaphors to explain complex conceptsAim for 'memification' where insights are catchy enough for execs to cite in meetings

"The incredible power of a simple idea to bring people together. One of the reasons why VaccinateCA was so powerful and got so many people to help is everybody immediately understood why it would be useful and how they specifically could be making a difference... 'Pick up phone, help save lives.'"  Tactical:  Distill the mission into a simple, actionable phraseConnect the individual's specific actions directly to the larger impact    "Having more of a point of view than just about your product, you can try and say, like, 'We are part of something bigger. Here's the broader circle or movement that we are a part of.' It makes it feel more inevitable and more like you're not just self servingly talking about your tiny corner of the world."  Tactical:  Develop a point of view that extends beyond the product's featuresConnect the company's mission to broader industry or societal trends

"the storytelling team is about people we don't have the privilege of serving yet... That could be an investor, air quote, 'investor relations.' That could be members of the press, air quote, 'PR.' That could be just people out in the world, air quote, 'marketing'... It's telling our story to people and thinking about that holistically in full stack."  Tactical:  Hire multidisciplinary storytellers (e.g., former reporters, filmmakers) rather than traditional marketersFocus on 'radical trust building' by showing the human side of the company
