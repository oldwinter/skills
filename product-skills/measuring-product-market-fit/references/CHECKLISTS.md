# Checklists (Quality Gate)

Use this checklist before finalizing a PMF Measurement Pack.

## A) Scope + decision clarity
- [ ] The decision this work informs is explicit (scale spend / launch / narrow ICP / reposition / pricing / pause growth).
- [ ] Stage and business model are stated (B2B/B2C/marketplace side).
- [ ] Key segments are defined (not “everyone”).

## B) Definitions are rigorous
- [ ] “Active user” is defined with an inclusion rule.
- [ ] “Core value moment” is defined and matches the product’s value proposition.
- [ ] Activation and retention are clearly separated.

## C) Survey quality (Sean Ellis)
- [ ] Survey population is appropriate (active users; segment coverage is intentional).
- [ ] Results include **counts (n)** and are split by segment where possible.
- [ ] Bias risks are called out (survivorship, channel bias, enterprise gating, incentives).
- [ ] The “primary benefit” responses are synthesized into themes.

## D) Behavioral evidence quality
- [ ] Retention is computed from a clear cohort start and a clear retention event.
- [ ] Retention curve interpretation matches the product’s natural cadence (daily/weekly/monthly).
- [ ] Confounders are identified (seasonality, instrumentation changes, cohort mix shifts).
- [ ] Instrumentation gaps are listed with a plan to fix them (if needed).

## E) Advocacy / reference evidence quality
- [ ] Reference evidence is current and maps to the intended segments.
- [ ] Evidence type is explicit (testimonial/case study/reference call/review).
- [ ] Gaps are identified (which segments lack advocates and why).

## F) Diagnosis + actionability
- [ ] PMF status is stated **by segment** (No / Partial / Strong / At-risk) with confidence.
- [ ] Every major claim is supported by at least one signal (survey/behavior/references) or labeled as a hypothesis.
- [ ] Action plan contains 3–5 prioritized actions with metrics and timeboxes.

## G) Required closing section
- [ ] The pack includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, and **Next steps**.
