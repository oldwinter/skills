# Pricing Strategy — Workflow Notes

This file expands the SKILL workflow with practical guidance and common defaults.

## Workflow at a glance (7 steps)
1) Intake + decision framing
2) Segment map + value narrative
3) Pricing architecture (value metric + packaging + self-serve vs sales-led boundary)
4) WTP plan (treat price as a measure of value)
5) Conversion mechanics (sampling + friction reduction) + experiments
6) Recommendation + rollout/migration + review cadence
7) Quality gate + finalize (checklist + rubric + risks/questions/next steps)

## Default assumptions (use only if missing)
- Prefer a **simple packaging story** (3 plans max) unless there’s a clear need for complexity.
- Prefer **one primary value metric** with clear upgrade drivers.
- Treat pricing as an **iterative product surface**: default review cadence every **6–12 months**.
- If self-serve contracts routinely exceed ~**$10k–$15k**, expect you may need sales-led processes (invoicing, procurement, trust review).

## Guidance by step

### 1) Intake + decision framing
- Define the decision precisely: new pricing, repricing, packaging changes, trial changes, discount policy.
- Identify the “blast radius”: existing customers, contracts, migrations, support/sales readiness.
- Write down constraints early: billing limitations, contract terms, regional pricing, tax/VAT, app store rules.

### 2) Segment map + value narrative
- Separate **buyer** from **user**; pricing usually follows buyer WTP, but activation follows user value.
- Define value in customer language: outcomes, time saved, revenue generated, risks avoided.
- Capture “who should NOT buy this”: prevents pricing from trying to satisfy every segment.

### 3) Pricing architecture (value metric + packaging)
- Pick a value metric customers can predict and control.
- Ensure each plan has:
  - who it’s for
  - what is included
  - what drives upgrades
  - limits that align with value (not arbitrary)
- Explicitly call out when self-serve breaks: security requirements, invoicing, procurement, credit card limits, or spending authority.

### 4) WTP plan
- Use triangulation: customer interviews + observed behavior + competitive context (public info only).
- Prefer learning **ranges** first; don’t overfit to a single “right number”.
- Treat price as a “value meter”: if customers won’t pay, investigate value/positioning/segment fit (not just the number).

### 5) Conversion mechanics + experiments
- Make premium value visible early:
  - sample premium features inside the free workflow
  - reverse trial (auto-enable premium briefly, then downgrade)
  - capped trial (limited premium actions/day)
- Reduce monetary friction where it increases learning and adoption (e.g., longer trials, starter discounts), but define:
  - abuse controls
  - eligibility rules
  - success metrics beyond short-term conversion (retention, expansion, GMV, LTV)

### 6) Recommendation + rollout/migration + review cadence
- Provide 2–3 coherent options, then recommend one.
- Include a migration plan for existing customers:
  - who is grandfathered
  - what changes when
  - communications and support plan
  - rollback criteria and how to execute rollback
- Define the review cadence and triggers (new value shipped, conversion drift, competitive shift).

### 7) Quality gate + finalize
- Run the checklist and rubric.
- Ensure the pack includes: Risks, Open questions, Next steps, and a validation plan.
