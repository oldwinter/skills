# Rubric (1–5)

Score the Dogfooding Pack and outcomes. A “ship-ready” dogfooding cycle is typically **≥ 20/25** with no category below 3.

## 1) Workflow realism (1–5)
- **1:** Scenarios are vague or feature-based; no end-to-end “done”.
- **3:** Scenarios are end-to-end but miss day-0 or creator reality.
- **5:** Scenarios reflect real user goals (incl. day-0 + edge cases) with measurable done criteria.

## 2) Participation + intensity (1–5)
- **1:** Optional; inconsistent; no cadence.
- **3:** Regular sessions exist but not sustained or role-appropriate.
- **5:** Clear cadence and “creator commitments” where relevant; daily use produces stable signal.

## 3) Evidence quality (1–5)
- **1:** Mostly opinions; missing repro steps/evidence.
- **3:** Mixed quality; some issues lack expected vs actual.
- **5:** Issues are reproducible artifacts with evidence, severity, and scenario linkage.

## 4) Decision + follow-through (1–5)
- **1:** No triage; no owners; no dispositions.
- **3:** Some decisions, but weak linkage to scenario completion and ship gate.
- **5:** Triage produces clear dispositions, owners, and verified scenario-based improvements.

## 5) Safety + bias control (1–5)
- **1:** Uses real customer data unsafely; internal persona mismatch ignored.
- **3:** Some guardrails exist but aren’t enforced.
- **5:** Environment/data rules are clear; dogfooding limits are acknowledged; external feedback is planned to complement.
