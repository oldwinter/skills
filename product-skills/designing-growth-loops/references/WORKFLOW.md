# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with additional guidance, heuristics, and common pitfalls.

## Step 1 — Intake + goal framing
Anchor on a decision (what you’ll do differently), not curiosity.

Common decisions:
- Invest in **new loops** vs optimize existing channels
- Choose the **top 1–2 loops** for the next quarter
- Decide whether **paid acquisition** is viable (unit economics gate)

Pitfall: “We need growth” without a metric/timebox yields a generic brainstorming doc.

## Step 2 — Baseline the current growth system
Even if you’re “pre-loops,” you still have a system:
- a channel that brings users in
- a value moment
- some retention (even if poor)

Baseline should include:
- Acquisition: where users come from + rough volume
- Activation: what % hits the value moment
- Retention: a proxy (D7/D30, WAU/MAU, repeat purchase)
- Referral/share: any organic sharing/invites today

Pitfall: designing loops without knowing where the real bottleneck is (activation vs retention vs distribution).

## Step 3 — Generate loop candidates (micro + macro)
Treat loop design as hypothesis generation.

Loop categories (choose what fits your product):
- Viral/referral loop (invites, sharing, collaboration)
- Content/UGC loop (users create content that acquires users)
- SEO loop (content → search traffic → more content)
- Partner/integration loop (distribution via ecosystems)
- Sales loop (champions → expansion → internal referrals)
- Paid loop (spend → acquisition → revenue → reinvest)

Heuristic: in fast-moving categories, allocate meaningful effort to “bigger bet” loop innovation, not just incremental tuning.

Pitfall: listing tactics (“do TikTok”) without specifying the feedback mechanism (how outputs become future inputs).

## Step 4 — Model loops qualitatively (shared understanding)
You want a model that is:
- simple enough to explain
- explicit about assumptions
- clear about bottlenecks

Represent loops using:
- a table (input → action → output → feedback)
- and optionally a diagram (e.g., Mermaid) if your environment supports it

Pitfall: “funnel thinking” only—loops require a feedback path and cycle time.

## Step 5 — Quantify + prioritize (scorecard + gates)
Use best-available numbers to approximate throughput.

Simple loop math (example):
`new_users_per_week ≈ active_users × share_rate × invite_accept_rate`

Prioritization dimensions:
- Impact (if it works, how big)
- Confidence (evidence, precedent, prerequisites)
- Effort (engineering, content ops, sales ops)
- Cycle time (how fast you’ll learn / compound)
- Risk (policy, brand, trust)

Gates:
- **Paid loop gate:** if LTV/margins can’t support CAC/payback, do not recommend scaling paid; recommend fixing retention/monetization first.
- **Channel fit triad:** customer need × business goal × medium strength must align (don’t force audio if your product needs visuals).

Pitfall: choosing a loop that looks exciting but has a 6–12 month cycle time when you need learning in 2–4 weeks.

## Step 6 — Measurement plan (metrics + instrumentation)
A loop is only real if it’s measurable.

Define:
- Loop KPI (one headline measure per loop)
- Leading indicators (early signals)
- Required instrumentation (events + properties)
- Attribution assumptions (what you can/can’t infer)

Pitfall: shipping experiments without event definitions; you can’t learn and the loop “dies in analytics.”

## Step 7 — Experiment plan + quality gate
Translate loops into a practical plan:
- 30 days: de-risk prerequisites + first tests
- 60 days: iterate toward a working version
- 90 days: scale the winners + cut losers

Quality gate reminders:
- Run [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md)
- Score with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md)
- Always include **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**
