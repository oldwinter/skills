# Checklists

## A) Input readiness checklist
- Platform type (internal/external/hybrid) and owner are stated.
- Primary users and top jobs-to-be-done are explicit.
- Current state and the biggest pains are described with at least 2 concrete examples.
- Constraints (security/privacy/compliance, SLOs, budget, timeline) are captured.
- Decisions on the table are named (what needs a yes/no, by when, by whom).

## B) Platform-as-product checklist
- Platform Product Charter exists and includes a user promise, non-goals, and assumptions.
- A PM/owner (or clear ownership plan) is identified for internal platforms.
- Success metrics include at least one developer productivity metric (cycle time, time-to-debug, deploy frequency, integration success).

## C) Surface area + boundary checklist
- Surface inventory lists key capabilities, owners, consumers, and interfaces.
- “Paved road” defaults are explicitly documented (what decisions consumers no longer make).
- Boundary contract is clear (platform vs domain ownership) and avoids surprise responsibilities.

## D) Lifecycle + ecosystem checklist
- Lifecycle stage is chosen and justified with evidence.
- Open/close decisions are explicit for *this quarter*, not aspirational.
- Moat hypotheses are stated (1–3) and linked to assets or distribution.
- At least one compounding loop is defined as a causal chain with measurable leading indicators.
- Seeding plan exists and includes “investment gates” (signals to scale investment).

## E) Governance checklist
- What is open now vs later is stated (and why).
- Policies exist for access control, quotas/abuse, versioning/deprecation, and parity rules.
- Sustainability is addressed: docs, support, incident response, and compatibility commitments.

## F) AI system checklist (if applicable)
- Context is treated as a first-class asset (sources, freshness, permissions, audit).
- Multiple AI experiences are intentionally unified or intentionally separated (with rationale).
- Guardrails include least privilege + logging + evaluation/monitoring (not “guardrails will catch everything”).

## G) Roadmap + decision-readiness checklist
- 12‑month roadmap uses Now/Next/Later and is consistent with resourcing.
- Dependencies and sequencing are explicit.
- Includes rollback/exit paths where choices are risky or irreversible.
- Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** with owners or proposed owners.
