# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → Executable Skill)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/shipping-products/SKILL.md`

The original skill is insight-heavy (quotes + takeaways). This pack converts those insights into an **execution contract** (inputs/outputs/workflow + templates + checklists).

## What was preserved

1) **High speed as a competence signal (Nan Yu)**
- Preserved as: a focus on building a repeatable shipping system (small batches, clear ownership, clean rollback) rather than “rushing”.

2) **Ship fast to accelerate feedback (Dylan Field)**
- Preserved as: defaulting to staged rollouts and shipping earlier slices to get real-world learnings.

3) **Product Quality List / factory inspection (Matt MacInnis)**
- Preserved as: `references/CHECKLISTS.md` Stop-ship PQL + a “living checklist” process (update after escapes).

4) **Maximally accelerated principle (Nick Turley)**
- Preserved as: Workflow Step 3 forcing function (“If we had to ship tomorrow…”) to reveal critical path and cut non-essentials.

5) **Speed and stability move together (Nicole Forsgren)**
- Preserved as: guidance to ship smaller, more frequent changes and to invest in monitoring/rollback so stability improves with velocity.

## What was missing from the source
- The “Deep Dive” referenced `references/guest-insights.md`, but it was not present in the source folder.
- The source did not define concrete artifacts, templates, or quality gates; those are added here to make the skill agent-executable.
