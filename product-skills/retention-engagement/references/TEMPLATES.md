# TEMPLATES (Retention & Engagement)

Copy/paste templates for the **Retention & Engagement Improvement Pack**.

## 1) Retention & Engagement Improvement Pack (master template)

### 1) Context snapshot
- Product:
- ICP / primary user:
- Segments in scope:
- Stage:
- Goal (metric, baseline → target, date):
- Constraints (timebox, capacity, channels, privacy/brand):

### 2) Metric definitions + guardrails

| Metric | Definition (behavior) | Segment | Window | Baseline | Target | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Retention |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Engagement |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Activation |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Guardrails**
- Revenue / conversion:
- User trust (complaints, unsubscribes, refunds):
- Performance / reliability:

### 3) Diagnosis (what’s broken, where, and why)

**3.1 Cohort/curve snapshot (by segment)**
| Segment | Activation rate | D1 | D7 | D30 | WAU/MAU | Primary failure mode | Evidence |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**3.2 Onboarding drop-offs (if applicable)**
| Step | % reach | % complete | Biggest drop reason (hypothesis) | Instrumented? |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

**3.3 Primary diagnosis**
- Primary failure mode: Activation failure / Engagement decay / Monetization churn
- Biggest leak (segment × step × timeframe):
- Top 3 root-cause hypotheses (ranked):
  1)
  2)
  3)

### 4) Activation / “aha moment” definition (data-backed)

**Candidate behaviors**
| Candidate “aha” behavior | Threshold window | Why it represents value | Expected link to retention | Data available? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

**Chosen activation definition (v1)**
- Definition:
- Segment:
- Window:
- Leading indicator(s):

**Validation plan**
- How you’ll validate (correlation, survival, holdout, etc.):
- Decision rule (what would make you revise the definition):

### 5) Lever hypotheses map (convert insights → tests)

| Failure mode | Lever | Hypothesis | Leading indicator | Experiment ideas |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Activation failure | Onboarding/time-to-value |  |  |  |
| Engagement decay | Habit/daily return |  |  |  |
| Engagement decay | Accruing value |  |  |  |
| Any | Re-engagement |  |  |  |

### 6) Experiment backlog (prioritized)

**Prioritization**
| Experiment | Segment | Hypothesis | Impact | Confidence | Effort | Score | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Experiment cards (top 3–6)**

### 7) Measurement + instrumentation plan

**Key events**
| Event name | Description | Required properties | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

**Dashboards to create**
| Dashboard | Audience | Metrics | Refresh |
|---|---|---|---|

|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0–30 days |  |  |  |  |
| 31–60 days |  |  |  |  |
| 61–90 days |  |  |  |  |

### 9) Risks / Open questions / Next steps (required)
