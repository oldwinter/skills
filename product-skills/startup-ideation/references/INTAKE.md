# Intake (question bank)

Ask up to **5** questions at a time. If the user can’t answer, proceed with explicit assumptions and list **Open questions**.

## Decision + constraints
1) What decision are we making right now (generate ideas vs pick 1 vs design validation plan), and by when?
2) What constraints are hard constraints (time, budget, team size, runway, regulatory/privacy)?
3) What “success” looks like for the next 2–6 weeks (validated demand signal, LOIs, prototype feedback, revenue, etc.)?

## Founder/team advantage (off-the-beaten-path signals)
4) What domains/workflows have you lived in (jobs, side projects, communities)? Any recurring pain you personally experienced?
5) Any unfair advantages: distribution access, proprietary data, partnerships, credibility, unique tech, or speed?

## Customer + market shape
6) Prefer B2B or B2C? Any segments/industries you want to focus on or avoid?
7) Are you aiming for a specific business model (SaaS, usage-based, marketplace, services+software)?
8) What are you uniquely willing to do that others won’t (sales motion, enterprise, regulated, high-touch, hardware, etc.)?

## Idea starting point (optional)
9) What ideas are already on the table? What triggered them (customer quote, trend, competitor, personal pain)?
10) Any “no-go” areas (crypto, ads, healthcare, government, kids, etc.)?

## If the user is stuck (quick prompts)
- “Describe the last 3 times you felt: ‘This is a dumb process; why is it like this?’”
- “What spreadsheets/Slack workflows did your team rely on?”
- “What do you have to explain to newcomers repeatedly?”
- “What’s getting cheaper/faster/more capable that changes what’s possible now?”
