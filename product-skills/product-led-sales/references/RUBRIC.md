# Product-Led Sales — Scoring Rubric

Score each item **0/1/2**:
- 0 = missing / unusable
- 1 = present but incomplete
- 2 = clear, executable, reusable

Suggested passing bar: **>= 16/20**.

## 1) Discovery + triggering (0–2)
- Description and “When to use” include realistic triggers (PQL/PQA, signals, routing, sales assist)

## 2) Boundaries + readiness (0–2)
- Clear “When NOT to use” and a readiness/prerequisites gate

## 3) Input contract (0–2)
- Minimal required inputs listed; missing-info strategy followed (ask max 5 questions, then assume)

## 4) Output contract (0–2)
- Deliverables are explicit, checkable, and ordered

## 5) Workflow clarity (0–2)
- 5–9 steps, each with inputs → actions → outputs → checks

## 6) Signal quality (0–2)
- Signals are intent/value-aligned, measurable, and include false-positive controls

## 7) Routing + SLA feasibility (0–2)
- Routing rules match sales capacity; SLAs and dispositions are defined and usable

## 8) Outreach kit quality (0–2)
- Templates are helpful, compliant, and avoid creepy personalization; one clear ask per message

## 9) Measurement + pilot design (0–2)
- Pilot is bounded with leading/lagging metrics, guardrails, and iteration cadence

## 10) Safety + robustness (0–2)
- No secrets requested; no manipulative tactics; clear escalation to experts for legal/privacy/implementation
