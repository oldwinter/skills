# Intake (Designing Surveys)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**. If answers are missing, proceed with clearly labeled assumptions and list remaining unknowns under **Open questions**.

## A) Decision + goal (required)
1) What decision will this survey inform (and by when)?
2) What is the primary learning goal: satisfaction, drivers of friction, segmentation/profiling, PMF, churn reasons, concept feedback, messaging validation?
3) What action will you take if the results are “good”, “bad”, or “mixed”?

## B) Audience + sampling (required)
4) Who exactly should answer? (segment, role, plan, region, tenure, usage level)
5) What recency window matters? (e.g., “signed up 3–6 months ago” for accurate recall of the ‘before’ state)
6) What sample size is realistic and how will you reach them? (email list size, in-app MAU, CSM-managed accounts)
7) Are there sub-segments you must compare? (buyer vs user, admin vs member, power user vs novice)

## C) Channel + constraints (required)
8) Distribution channel(s): in-product modal, email, chat widget, CSM outreach, community, etc.?
9) Max completion time target? (default: 3–6 minutes)
10) Any constraints: languages, regions, incentives, cadence, or “no surveys this quarter” rules?

## D) Data + privacy/compliance (required)
11) What user attributes can you use for targeting/segmentation (if any)?
12) Any sensitive topics or restricted data (PII, employee data, health/financial info)?
13) Any internal requirements: legal review, consent, retention policy, opt-out?

## E) Analysis + reporting (recommended)
14) What are the must-have cuts? (e.g., plan tier, platform, tenure, use case)
15) Do you need trendability over time (baseline now, repeat monthly/quarterly)?
16) Who will consume the results and what format do they need (exec memo, dashboard, backlog)?

## Default assumptions (use if missing)
- Audience: active users in the last 30 days (plus a small “new user” cohort if onboarding-related)
- Metric: CSAT (1–7) + 1 open-ended “why” + 1 forced-choice diagnostic
- Length: ≤ 10 questions / ≤ 3–6 minutes
- Launch: pilot with 10–20 respondents, then full launch with 1 reminder
