# Templates

Use these templates to produce the Taste Calibration Pack.

## 1) Taste Calibration Brief (template)

### Context
- **Taste domain:** (e.g., onboarding)
- **Target user + job:** (who / what they’re trying to do)
- **Decision this informs:** (redesign direction, quality bar, experiment backlog, etc.)
- **Time box:** (e.g., 90 minutes; or 4-week practice plan)
- **Constraints:** (platform, accessibility, compliance, brand voice, technical constraints)

### “Good” decision criteria (6–10)
- Criteria list (observable, not vibes)

### Tradeoffs / non-goals
- What you will intentionally sacrifice or deprioritize

## 2) Benchmark Set (table)

| Benchmark | Why it’s relevant | What to study | Notes / links |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

## 3) Product Study Notes (1 page per benchmark)

### Benchmark
- Name + platform + user persona used

### Quick summary
- What this product does well in this domain (1–2 sentences)

### Moments (capture “what happened”)
| Moment | What I did | What happened | Emotion / friction | Why it might work (hypothesis) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

### Pattern candidates
- Potential rules (draft): DO / DO NOT

### Copy/pasteable artifacts
- Key microcopy, interaction details, defaults, empty states, error handling, etc.

## 4) Taste Rules + Anti-Patterns

### Taste rules (DO / DO NOT)
| Rule | Rationale | Evidence (benchmarks/moments) | Applies to | Exceptions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DO:  |  |  |  |  |
| DO NOT: |  |  |  |  |

### Anti-patterns (“slop filters”)
| Anti-pattern | How it shows up | Why it’s harmful | Replacement rule |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

## 5) Intuition → Hypothesis Log

| Intuition statement (“it feels…”) | Hypothesis (testable) | Predicted signal | Counter-signal | Smallest viable test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

## 6) Validation Plan (smallest viable checks)

### Hypotheses to validate (top 3–7)
- Link to rows in the hypothesis log

### Tests
| Hypothesis | Method | Sample | Success metric | Decision rule | Owner | When |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Instrumentation / tracking notes
- Events, funnels, qualitative tags, logging plan

## 7) Practice Plan (2–4 weeks)

### Cadence
- **Exposure hours:** (# sessions/week × minutes/session)
- **Weekly synthesis:** (time + output)
- **Peer calibration:** (optional: 1 session/week)

### Weekly plan
| Week | Focus | Benchmarks | Output |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Baseline + criteria |  | Taste brief + benchmark set |
| 2 | Deep studies |  | Study notes + rule drafts |
| 3 | Hypotheses + tests |  | Hypothesis log + validation |
| 4 | Consolidate |  | Final rules + next steps |
