# Rubric (1–5)

Score the Taste Calibration Pack. A “ship-ready” pack is typically **≥ 24/35** with no category below 3.

## 1) Domain focus (1–5)
- **1:** Vague (“improve product taste”) with no specific domain or moment.
- **3:** Domain is named; scope is mostly clear.
- **5:** Domain + moment + target user/job are crisp and clearly bounded.

## 2) Criteria + tradeoffs (1–5)
- **1:** Generic adjectives; no tradeoffs.
- **3:** Criteria are mostly observable; tradeoffs exist but are thin.
- **5:** Criteria are concrete, prioritized, and include explicit tradeoffs/non-goals.

## 3) Benchmark set quality (1–5)
- **1:** Random list; no rationale; no outside-category references.
- **3:** Reasonable set with some rationale.
- **5:** Curated set with clear “what to study” per benchmark and diversity across categories.

## 4) Observation depth (1–5)
- **1:** Opinions without moments.
- **3:** Some concrete moments captured; inconsistent structure.
- **5:** Consistent, moment-based notes across benchmarks with precise details and pattern candidates.

## 5) Rules + anti-patterns (1–5)
- **1:** Rules are vague or ungrounded.
- **3:** Rules exist but lack applicability guidance or evidence.
- **5:** DO/DO NOT rules are evidence-backed, scoped, and immediately reusable in product work.

## 6) Hypotheses + validation (1–5)
- **1:** Intuition remains subjective; no falsification.
- **3:** Some hypotheses and tests; decision rules missing.
- **5:** Hypotheses are testable with predicted/counter-signals and realistic smallest-viable validation steps.

## 7) Practice loop (1–5)
- **1:** One-off critique with no habit plan.
- **3:** A cadence is described but not operational.
- **5:** A 2–4 week plan with exposure hours + weekly synthesis + optional peer calibration is ready to execute.
