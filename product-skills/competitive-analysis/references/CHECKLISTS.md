# Checklists

Use these to validate the Competitive Analysis Pack before finalizing.

## A) Scope + decision checklist
- [ ] The pack states the **decision** it supports and the **deadline**
- [ ] ICP, use case, and constraints (geo/compliance/price band) are explicit
- [ ] The analysis is scoped to a **focus set** (top 5–10), not an infinite list

## B) Competitive alternatives checklist (no “logo garden”)
- [ ] Includes **status quo** and **workarounds/internal build**
- [ ] Includes at least one **analog/traditional** or non-obvious alternative (when relevant)
- [ ] Identifies the likely **true alternative in the deal**
- [ ] Separates direct vs indirect competitors clearly

## C) Evidence checklist
- [ ] Each competitor entry has evidence links/quotes or is labeled low-confidence
- [ ] Claims avoid speculation and clearly label unknowns
- [ ] No confidential or non-public information is requested or implied

## D) Customer POV checklist
- [ ] Decision criteria are expressed as customer outcomes/risks (not feature lists)
- [ ] The comparison matrix reflects what customers actually value in the decision
- [ ] The pack explains “why they win” from the market/customer perspective

## E) Positioning + differentiation checklist
- [ ] 2–3 positioning hypotheses are stated **against a named alternative**
- [ ] Each hypothesis includes proof points and explicit tradeoffs/non-goals
- [ ] Win themes and loss risks are consistent with the matrix and evidence

## F) Battlecards checklist (usable in practice)
- [ ] Battlecards include do/don’t talk tracks, landmines, and objection handling
- [ ] Battlecards cite evidence and avoid “trash talk”
- [ ] Battlecards are tailored to the intended audience (sales/PM/exec)

## G) Actionability + monitoring checklist
- [ ] Recommendations are concrete and tied to win themes/loss risks
- [ ] Monitoring plan includes signals, cadence, owners, and update triggers
- [ ] Includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, and **Next steps**
