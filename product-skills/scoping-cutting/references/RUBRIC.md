Score each category 0/1/2:
- 0 = missing / unclear
- 1 = present but incomplete
- 2 = clear, executable, decision-ready

Suggested passing bar: **>= 12/16**.

## 1) Decision + appetite clarity (0–2)
- Decision (ship/defer/stop) and DRI are explicit
- Appetite/time budget and constraints are explicit

## 2) Outcome + hypothesis quality (0–2)
- Outcome is user-centric and specific
- Hypotheses are testable with success/failure criteria

## 3) Metrics + guardrails (0–2)
- Success metrics are measurable and unambiguous
- Guardrails protect trust/quality/cost and are not easily gamed

## 4) Minimum Lovable Slice coherence (0–2)
- Slice is end-to-end and delivers core value
- Must-haves are minimal; non-goals are explicit

## 5) Cut list rigor (0–2)
- Cuts/deferrals have explicit rationale
- “Revisit when…” triggers prevent forgotten scope

## 6) Validation plan strength (0–2)
- Targets the top unknowns
- Runs without building the full system; criteria are defined up front

## 7) Delivery plan realism (0–2)
- Milestones fit the appetite and show a path to “done”
- Dependencies/owners are explicit enough to execute

## 8) Scope-change guardrails (0–2)
- “Trade, don’t add” policy is clear and enforceable
