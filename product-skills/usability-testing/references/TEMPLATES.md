# Templates (Usability Testing)

Copy/paste templates for the **Usability Test Pack** deliverables.

## 1) Usability Test Pack (outline)

### A) Context snapshot
- Decision to inform (by date):
- What is being tested (flow/feature):
- Target participant:
- Platform/environment:
- Session format (moderated/unmoderated; remote/in-person):
- Constraints (n, time, incentives, recording/privacy):
- Existing evidence (analytics, tickets, prior research):

### B) Test plan
- Goal (1 sentence):
- Research questions (3–5):
- Hypotheses (optional):
- Method choice (why usability testing vs alternatives):
- Stimulus/prototype strategy (live vs prototype vs fake door vs Wizard of Oz):
- Key success criteria / observables:
- Risks + mitigations (privacy, prototype limitations, scheduling):

### C) Participant plan
- Inclusion criteria (behavior/context):
- Exclusion criteria:
- Sample size + mix (core + edge cases):
- Recruiting channels + outreach copy:
- Schedule plan + backups:

### D) Moderator guide + task script
**Intro (2–3 min):**
- Thank you + purpose:
- “We’re testing the product, not you.”
- Consent + recording statement:
- Think-aloud request:

**Warm-up (2–3 min):**
- “Tell me about the last time you <related goal>…”

**Tasks (5–8):**
For each task:
- Task prompt:
- Starting state:
- Success criteria:
- Probes:
  - “What are you expecting?”
  - “What made you choose that?”
  - “What would you do next?”

**Wrap-up (3–5 min):**
- Biggest confusion/friction?
- What would you change first?
- If you had a magic wand…?
- Any final notes?

### E) Note-taking template (per session)
- Participant (segment notes):
- Task-by-task notes:
  - Task:
  - Outcome (completed / partial / failed):
  - Errors/confusions:
  - Verbatim quote(s):
  - Timestamp/screenshot ref:
  - Severity (draft):
- Top 3 highlights:
- Top 3 follow-ups for next sessions:

### F) Issue log (copy/paste table)

| ID | Issue | Evidence (quote/screenshot) | Severity | Frequency | Impacted metric/step | Likely cause | Recommendation | Effort | Owner |
|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Severity guidance (pick one and keep consistent):
- 4 = blocking (can’t complete)
- 3 = major (completes with struggle/workaround)
- 2 = minor (noticeable friction)
- 1 = cosmetic/confusion but no impact

### G) Synthesis readout
- Executive summary (5 bullets max):
- What we tested + who we tested with:
- Top findings (themes) with evidence:
- Prioritized issues (top 5–10):
- Recommendations (quick wins vs structural fixes):
- What we did **not** test (scope boundary):
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps:

## 2) Wizard of Oz / Fake door plan (copy/paste)

- What the user will see (frontstage):
- What is simulated (backstage):
- Who performs the backstage work:
- Latency/response expectations:
- Safety/ethics notes (disclosure, data handling):
- How you’ll capture outcomes (success criteria + evidence):

---

## 3) “Reality check” observation template (optional)

- Where/what you observed:
- Who you observed (approx, anonymized):
- What happened (step-by-step):
- Where people got stuck (moments of friction):
- Implications/hypotheses for our product:
