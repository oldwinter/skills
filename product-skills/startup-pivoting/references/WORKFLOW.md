# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra heuristics and decision traps to avoid.

## Step 1 — Frame the decision (and the clock)
Common failure mode: “We’re considering a pivot” without a decision date.

Good framing examples:
- “In 6 weeks we will decide: pivot to ICP B vs persevere with ICP A.”
- “In 4 weeks we will decide: shut down vs pivot thesis X.”

## Step 2 — Diagnose what’s stuck
Separate “demand” from “execution”:
- **Demand/value problem signals:** strong onboarding but low retention, weak willingness to pay, customers don’t care, no repeatable use case.
- **Execution/distribution problem signals:** retention is strong for a subset but you can’t acquire, onboarding is broken, pricing/packaging mismatch, wrong channel.

Heuristic: If a small cohort loves it (high retention, strong pull), you may have an **ICP/positioning/channel** problem, not a product-value problem.

## Step 3 — Exhaustion check (“have you exhausted the possibilities?”)
Operationalize “exhausted” as: you have made credible attempts at the most likely non-pivot levers given your stage.

Typical non-pivot levers to consider:
- ICP refinement (narrower, more acute pain)
- Positioning/promise rewrite (same product, clearer value)
- Pricing/packaging changes
- Onboarding and time-to-value improvements
- Distribution/channel experiments
- Reliability/quality fixes (if trust is the blocker)

Time-box rule: If you think a non-pivot lever could work, time-box it (e.g., 2–3 weeks) with a measurable target. If it fails, you stop arguing and move on.

## Step 4 — Generate pivot options (10% vs 200%)
Common founder trap: a “10% pivot” that preserves the current identity but doesn’t change the outcome.

This pack forces at least one **200% pivot** option:
- A bet that changes at least **two** of: problem, persona, product, positioning/package.
- It should feel uncomfortable (because it breaks attachment), but still plausible given strengths and runway.

## Step 5 — Pivot thesis + metrics + kill criteria
A good pivot thesis is falsifiable:
- “We believe <persona> has <problem> and will pay <price> for <promise> because <reason/evidence>.”

Kill criteria examples:
- “If we cannot get 10 qualified design partners in 3 weeks, we stop.”
- “If D7 retention is <X after improving onboarding, the core value is not there.”
- “If <metric> doesn’t move by <date> despite executing the plan, we reassess.”

## Step 6 — Validation + execution plan (pivot sprint)
Validation should include at least one “hard truth” test that could disconfirm the thesis:
- Pre-sell / LOIs (B2B), paid waitlist (consumer), concierge pilot, partner channel commitment, etc.

Execution should include a cut list:
- What you will stop building/maintaining to make room for the pivot.

## Step 7 — Quality gate
The output should be shareable as a memo:
- What we learned
- Why pivot vs persevere
- What we will do next
- How we’ll know
- What could go wrong
