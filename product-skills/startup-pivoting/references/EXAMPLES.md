# Examples

**Example 1 (B2B SaaS stuck pre-PMF):** “We built an AI support copilot for SMBs. Trials convert, but retention is poor and sales cycles are long. We have 6 months of runway. Should we pivot, and if so how?”  
Expected: a Pivot Decision & Execution Pack with an exhaustion check (pricing/onboarding/ICP), 4–8 pivot options including at least one 200% pivot, a chosen thesis with metrics/kill criteria, and a 4–6 week pivot sprint plan.

**Example 2 (Consumer plateau):** “Our language learning app growth stalled and D30 retention is low. We suspect our promise is wrong. Create a pivot options map and a validation plan.”  
Expected: a 4P pivot grid that includes positioning/package changes and at least one new persona/problem angle, plus a time-boxed validation plan with decision gates.

**Boundary example:** “Just tell us what to pivot to—no metrics, no customers, no constraints.”  
Response: explain that pivoting without evidence is guesswork; ask 3–5 intake questions, propose a discovery/validation sprint, and only then produce a pivot thesis and plan.
