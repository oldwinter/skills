# Examples

## Example 1 — B2B SaaS (homepage + sales)
**Prompt:** “Use `positioning-messaging`. Product: an audit-ready AI assistant for SOC2 evidence collection. ICP: security leaders at 200–2,000 employee SaaS companies. Alternative: spreadsheets + GRC consultants. Proof: ‘cut audit prep time by 40%’ + 3 case studies. Surfaces: homepage hero + sales talk track. Output: a Positioning & Messaging Pack.”

**What good looks like:**
- Explicit “against spreadsheets + consultants”
- Category frame that’s easy to repeat
- 3 pillars with proof points mapped to outcomes (time, risk, trust)
- Copy set includes hero options + talk track + “say this / not that”

## Example 2 — Creator product (taglines + pattern match)
**Prompt:** “We’re a subscription community platform for finance creators. Reposition to premium creators and draft 10 taglines + 5 hero options. Include a press pattern match.”

**What good looks like:**
- Clear ICP shift reflected in category frame
- Taglines avoid generic creator buzzwords; highlight concrete outcomes (retention, revenue, workflow)
- Press pattern match is simple and paired with an honest “but unlike”

## Boundary example — No ICP / no alternative
**Prompt:** “Write our positioning.”

**What to do instead:**
- Ask 5 questions from [INTAKE.md](INTAKE.md) (ICP, use case, alternative, proof, surface)
- If unanswered, make explicit assumptions and provide 2–3 positioning directions with risks/unknowns
