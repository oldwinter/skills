# Rubric (1–5)

Score the Positioning & Messaging Pack. A “ship-ready” pack is typically **≥ 22/30** with no category below 3.

## 1) Audience + use-case fit (1–5)
- **1:** ICP/use case are vague; could be for anyone.
- **3:** ICP/use case are stated; some tailoring exists.
- **5:** ICP/use case are specific; language clearly matches the audience’s context and constraints.

## 2) Category frame + “against” alternative (1–5)
- **1:** No clear category; no comparative alternative.
- **3:** Category is stated; alternative is implied.
- **5:** Category is crisp and the “against” alternative is explicit and credible.

## 3) Differentiation + tradeoffs (1–5)
- **1:** Generic claims; no tradeoffs.
- **3:** Some differentiation, but still could apply to many products.
- **5:** Differentiation is specific, includes tradeoffs/non-goals, and is tied to the alternative.

## 4) Proof + credibility (1–5)
- **1:** Claims are unsupported; feels like marketing fluff.
- **3:** Some proof exists but doesn’t map cleanly to key claims.
- **5:** Proof points clearly support differentiators; unknowns are labeled and queued for validation.

## 5) Messaging hierarchy quality (1–5)
- **1:** Pillars overlap; core message is long or unclear.
- **3:** Core message and pillars exist; some redundancy remains.
- **5:** Core message is memorable; pillars are distinct, parallel, and outcome-oriented with clarifiers.

## 6) Copy usability + testability (1–5)
- **1:** Copy is slogans-only; no validation plan.
- **3:** Copy set is usable; validation plan is generic.
- **5:** Copy set is ready for deployment on named surfaces, and validation plan has clear questions + decision rule.
