## Preserved insights → rules/checks

### 1) Weak positioning creates funnel friction (April Dunford)
- **Rule:** Every output must include an explicit category frame and an “against” alternative.
- **Check:** Can a prospect understand “what it is” and “why better than the alternative” in < 10 seconds?

### 2) Communication is defined by listener understanding + recall (Gina Gotthilf)
- **Rule:** Include a validation plan that tests comprehension and recall, not just preference.
- **Check:** Do ≥70% of test participants correctly restate what it is + who it’s for, and recall at least one pillar later?

### 3) Positioning comes first + consistency matters (Arielle Jackson)
- **Rule:** Positioning brief precedes copywriting; include internal enablement assets for consistency.
- **Check:** Two internal stakeholders independently describe the product using the same category frame and core message.

### 4) Be direct + use pattern matching for press (Emilie Gerber)
- **Rule:** Prefer direct language and simple pattern matching over trend-story complexity.
- **Check:** Hero/pitch copy uses concrete nouns/verbs and avoids multi-paragraph setups.

### 5) Brand assets set expectations (Jessica Hische)
- **Rule:** Ensure copy promises match the product experience and implied brand tone.
- **Check:** Do the chosen words/tone set accurate expectations and avoid “promise–delivery” mismatch?
