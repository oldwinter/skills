# Checklists

Use these to validate the Positioning & Messaging Pack before finalizing.

## A) Scope + audience checklist
- [ ] ICP (buyer/user) and primary use case are explicit
- [ ] The pack names the primary surface(s) (homepage, sales, press, etc.)
- [ ] The pack defines what success looks like (comprehension, conversion, pipeline speed, recall)

## B) Positioning clarity checklist (“against” alternative)
- [ ] The “against” alternative is explicit (status quo/workaround/competitor)
- [ ] Category frame is understandable in one sentence (no jargon dependency)
- [ ] Tradeoffs/non-goals are stated (what you’re not / who you’re not for)

## C) Specificity + proof checklist (no vague claims)
- [ ] Differentiators are concrete (not “best-in-class”, “revolutionary”, “world-class”)
- [ ] Each key claim has proof or is labeled “to validate”
- [ ] Objections are anticipated with short, honest responses

## D) Messaging hierarchy checklist (listener-first)
- [ ] Core message fits in one sentence and is easy to repeat
- [ ] 3 pillars are distinct, parallel, and map to real customer outcomes
- [ ] “What we mean / what we don’t mean” prevents common misinterpretations

## E) Copy quality checklist (direct + memorable)
- [ ] Copy uses concrete nouns/verbs; avoids abstract trend-story throat-clearing
- [ ] Homepage hero options include headline + subhead + CTA (not just slogans)
- [ ] Taglines/headlines reflect the chosen category frame and differentiation

## F) Consistency checklist (internal + external)
- [ ] “Say this / not that” removes ambiguity and aligns teams
- [ ] Internal script can be used by sales/support without edits
- [ ] If sales is involved: includes a short “reset” explanation for confused prospects

## G) Validation checklist (understanding + recall)
- [ ] Validation plan tests comprehension (“what is it?”) and recall (“what do you remember?”)
- [ ] Decision rule is stated (keep vs revise)
- [ ] Next iteration loop is feasible given time/resources

## H) Finalization checklist
- [ ] Includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**
- [ ] Assumptions and unknowns are labeled
- [ ] Output is shareable as-is (minimal editing required)
