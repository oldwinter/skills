# Positioning & Messaging

## Scope

**Covers**
- Positioning (category, ICP, differentiation, “against what alternative”)
- Messaging hierarchy (core message + pillars + proof)
- Value proposition + copy primitives (one-liner, tagline, headline/subhead, elevator pitch)
- Channel adaptation (website, sales, press pattern-matching)
- Lightweight message validation plan

**When to use**
- “We need clearer positioning and messaging.”
- “Rewrite our value prop / one-liner / tagline / homepage hero.”
- “People don’t ‘get it’—pipeline is sluggish and sales keeps re-explaining.”
- “Create a messaging hierarchy and proof points for <ICP>.”
- “Give me 5 headline/tagline options that fit our positioning.”

**When NOT to use**
- You need to decide *what to build* (use a problem definition / strategy workflow first)
- You need a full brand identity system (visual identity guidelines, logo, UI kit)
- You need only copyediting/tone-polish of existing copy with no positioning change
- You don’t have (or refuse to assume) an ICP/use case and “alternative” to position against

## Inputs

**Minimum required**
- Product: what it is + what it does (1–3 sentences)
- Target audience (ICP/persona) and primary use case / job-to-be-done
- Primary alternative(s): status quo, competitor, internal build, agency, manual workaround
- Differentiators + proof (features, results, customer quotes, credibility signals)
- Primary surface(s): website hero, sales pitch, deck, ads, press, app onboarding
- Constraints: tone/voice, compliance/claims, taboo words, time box

**Missing-info strategy**
- Ask up to 5 questions from [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md).
- If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns. Provide 2–3 alternate positioning directions if uncertainty is high.

## Outputs (deliverables)

Produce a **Positioning & Messaging Pack** in Markdown (in-chat; or as files if requested):

1) **Context snapshot** (decision, ICP, use case, surfaces, constraints)
2) **Positioning brief** (category + “against” alternative + differentiation + proof + tradeoffs)
3) **Messaging hierarchy** (core message + 3 pillars + proof points + objections)
4) **Copy set** (one-liner, elevator pitch, tagline options, homepage hero headline/subhead, CTA suggestions)
5) **Consistency enablement** (“say this / not that”, internal script, sales talk track)
6) **Validation plan** (how to test for understanding + recall; next iteration loop)
7) **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** (always included)

## Workflow (8 steps)

### 1) Intake + success definition
- **Inputs:** User context; [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md).
- **Actions:** Clarify ICP, use case, primary surface(s), and what “better” means (pipeline response, conversion, comprehension, recall).
- **Outputs:** Context snapshot.
- **Checks:** A stakeholder can answer: “Who is this for, and what will this messaging change?”

### 2) Choose the “against” alternative + category frame
- **Inputs:** Known competitors/status quo; market context.
- **Actions:** Identify the real alternative in the decision (status quo/workaround/competitor). Choose a category frame and a simple pattern match (“<category> for <audience>”).
- **Outputs:** “Against” alternative + category statement options.
- **Checks:** The category is understandable without a glossary; the “against” alternative is explicit.

### 3) Write the positioning brief (specific, with tradeoffs)
- **Inputs:** Differentiators + proof.
- **Actions:** Draft a positioning statement and supporting brief: value, differentiation, proof, and what you *don’t* do (tradeoffs/non-goals).
- **Outputs:** Positioning brief.
- **Checks:** The positioning could not plausibly fit 3 different competitors; proof is concrete or labeled “to validate”.

### 4) Build a messaging hierarchy (listener-first)
- **Inputs:** Positioning brief; audience pains/goals; objections.
- **Actions:** Create: core message → 3 pillars → proof points. Add “what we mean / what we don’t mean” to prevent confusion.
- **Outputs:** Messaging hierarchy + proof bank.
- **Checks:** A first-time reader can restate the value in one sentence; message is memorable (see checklist).

### 5) Generate copy primitives (tight + pattern-matched)
- **Inputs:** Messaging hierarchy; target surfaces.
- **Actions:** Draft one-liner, elevator pitch, tagline options, and hero headline/subhead. Keep it direct; use pattern matching when helpful (especially for press).
- **Outputs:** Copy set (v1).
- **Checks:** Copy is concrete (specific nouns/verbs), avoids vague superlatives, and matches the category frame.

### 6) Create consistency + enablement assets
- **Inputs:** Copy set; internal stakeholders; sales/support needs.
- **Actions:** Produce “say this / not that”, internal description script, and a short sales talk track + “reset” explanation for confused prospects.
- **Outputs:** Consistency enablement section.
- **Checks:** Two different team members would describe the product the same way.

### 7) Draft a validation plan (understanding + recall)
- **Inputs:** Channels + time box; access to customers/prospects.
- **Actions:** Propose a lightweight test plan: comprehension (“what is it?”), relevance (“is this for you?”), and recall (“what do you remember tomorrow?”). Include 5–8 test questions and a decision rule.
- **Outputs:** Validation plan + iteration loop.
- **Checks:** Plan is feasible given constraints; includes a clear “revise/keep” rule.

### 8) Quality gate + finalize
- **Inputs:** Draft pack.
- **Actions:** Run [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and score with [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md). Add Risks/Open questions/Next steps.
- **Outputs:** Final Positioning & Messaging Pack.
- **Checks:** The pack is usable as-is by marketing + sales + founders; assumptions are explicit.

## Quality gate (required)
- Use [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md).
- Always include: **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**.

## Examples

**Example 1 (B2B SaaS):** “We’re an AI QA tool for customer support teams. Create positioning + messaging and 5 homepage hero options.”  
Expected: positioning brief (against ‘manual QA + spreadsheets’), messaging pillars with proof, one-liner/taglines, hero headline/subhead set, and validation questions.

**Example 2 (Marketplace):** “We’re moving upmarket. Reposition for IT managers and draft an elevator pitch + sales talk track.”  
Expected: revised category frame and “against” alternative, updated messaging hierarchy for the new buyer, pitch + talk track, and a short enablement section.

**Boundary example:** “Write me a logo and brand identity.”  
Response: decline visual identity work; offer to produce positioning/messaging and a brief for a brand designer.
