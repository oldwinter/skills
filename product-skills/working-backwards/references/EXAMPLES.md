# Examples

These are intentionally short; treat them as starting points, not “perfect answers”.

## Example 1 (B2B SaaS): “Role-based dashboards”

**Context snapshot (excerpt)**
- Product: B2B analytics platform
- Target user: Enterprise admins + department leads
- Problem today: admins can’t tailor dashboards by role; teams see irrelevant data and adoption stalls
- Why now: enterprise expansion requires governance and least-privilege views
- Target launch: beta in 8 weeks

**PR option idea (one-liner)**
- Option A: role-based default dashboards (admin curated)
- Option B: dashboard “packs” by department with templates
- Option C: permissioned saved views with sharing

Expected output: 2–3 PR options, selected PR/FAQ, and a backcasting plan that includes security review, permissions model, analytics, docs, and support enablement.

## Example 2 (Consumer): “Saved routes”

Expected output: divergent PRs (e.g., “commute routine” vs “multi-stop planning”), a selected PR/FAQ, and metrics/guardrails (repeat usage, retention; privacy, battery, safety).

## Boundary example: “Use AI”

Prompt: “Write a PR/FAQ for using AI in our product.”

Expected response: refuse to fabricate customer clarity; ask the minimum intake questions and/or redirect to `problem-definition`.
