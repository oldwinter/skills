# Checklists

Use these before you circulate a Working Backwards Pack.

## PR (future press release) checklist
- Problem-first: “Problem today” is clear before any solution language
- Customer language: no internal jargon, acronyms, or org names
- Clear value: headline + summary state who benefits and how
- Concrete “how it works”: 3–6 bullets; not a vague feature list
- Boundaries: “who it’s for / not for” is explicit
- Credible quotes: customer quote reflects a real pain + outcome
- Rollout assumptions are stated (tier/date/eligibility) or flagged as open questions

## FAQ checklist
- Addresses: why now, alternatives, out of scope, risks, success metrics
- Includes internal “machinery” questions (support, docs, analytics, approvals)
- Open questions are labeled with an owner + decision date (not buried)
- No hand-waving: uncertain answers include options (A/B/C) and a proposed path to decide

## Backcasting plan checklist
- Launch tier(s) are defined (internal/beta/GA) with a target date/timebox
- Each milestone has an owner and clear “done” criteria
- Dependencies and sign-offs are listed (security/legal/compliance when relevant)
- Instrumentation and monitoring are included as milestones (not afterthoughts)
- Rollout + rollback triggers are defined

## Common failure modes (use as a red-flag scan)
- Solution-first doc: the “problem” reads like a justification for a predetermined build
- Options are superficial: A/B/C differ only in wording, not in approach
- Missing “machinery”: no owners, dependencies, or plan beyond the PR text
- Undefined success: metrics/guardrails are missing or not computable
- Risks are generic: no specific failure modes or mitigations
