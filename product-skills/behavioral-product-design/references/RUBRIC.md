# Rubric (score 1–5)

Score the pack, then improve the lowest sections before finalizing.

## 1) Problem + behavior clarity
**1** Vague goal (“engagement”), no specific behavior or baseline.  
**3** Behavior and baseline exist but context/guardrails are weak.  
**5** Clear behavior spec, baseline, success + guardrails, and user benefit.

## 2) Diagnosis quality
**1** Generic bias list with no link to the user journey.  
**3** Some moments/barriers mapped, evidence is partial.  
**5** Clear moment-by-moment diagnosis with evidence and labeled hypotheses.

## 3) Intervention–mechanism fit
**1** UI ideas without mechanisms; “add reminders” everywhere.  
**3** Some mechanism alignment; gaps in feasibility or coverage.  
**5** Interventions clearly map to mechanisms and cover friction/uncertainty/motivation.

## 4) Ethics + user trust
**1** Manipulative/dark patterns or missing user control.  
**3** Mentions ethics but lacks concrete mitigations and controls.  
**5** Explicit transparency, opt-out, harm mitigations, and safeguards for sensitive contexts.

## 5) Experimentation + measurement
**1** No instrumentation or decision rule.  
**3** Metrics exist but unclear evaluation plan.  
**5** Feasible experiment design, events defined, guardrails + rollout/rollback included.

## 6) Execution readiness
**1** Not actionable; no build-ready specs.  
**3** Some specs but missing states/edge cases.  
**5** 1–3 intervention specs are implementable in 1–2 sprints with clear checks.
