# Source summary (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/behavioral-product-design/SKILL.md`

The source skill is a short stub referencing two product leaders and two core ideas:

1) **Loss aversion + retention thresholds (Jackson Shuttleworth)**  
Quote fragment: “Once you hit seven days, loss aversion kicks in, and you retain.”  
Interpreted as: once users accumulate meaningful progress (e.g., a streak), they become motivated to avoid losing it. This skill pack turns that insight into concrete patterns (progress ownership, milestones) and guardrails (avoid coercion, add resilience).

2) **Applying behavioral science to real product problems (Kristen Berman)**  
Quote fragment: behavioral science/design applies psychology to real-world problems.  
Interpreted as: use mechanisms (e.g., present bias, status quo effect, uncertainty aversion) intentionally to drive desired actions. This skill pack operationalizes that into a diagnosis → intervention → experiment workflow.

Notes:
- The source text is incomplete/truncated, so this skill pack fills missing “actions + artifacts” with standard behavioral design practice (mechanism-first design, ethical constraints, experimentability).
