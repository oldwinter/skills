# Examples (expanded)

These examples are longer than the ones in `../SKILL.md` and are meant as copy/paste starting points.

## Example 1 — Reduce uncertainty during checkout (B2C)

**Context:** Users abandon checkout at shipping. Support tickets mention “not sure when it arrives” and “returns are unclear”.  
**Target behavior:** Complete checkout within 10 minutes of adding to cart.  
**Likely barriers:** uncertainty aversion + perceived risk; friction from extra steps.

**Interventions (sample):**
- Delivery promise + date range shown earlier (reduce uncertainty)
- Clear returns guarantee copy + link (reduce perceived risk)
- Save cart + “resume later” (reduce ability/friction)

**Experiment:** A/B test “promise + guarantee” vs control; primary metric checkout completion; guardrails refunds/CS tickets.

## Example 2 — Build a 7-day habit loop (consumer app)

**Context:** Daily check-in feature. D1 is fine; D3 falls hard.  
**Target behavior:** Complete a daily check-in 4+ days in the first week.  
**Mechanisms:** present bias; loss aversion/progress ownership; forgetting.

**Interventions (sample):**
- “Start small” 30-second check-in (reduce friction)
- Meaningful weekly “pause moment” celebration at day 7 (reinforcement)
- “Bend not break” grace day (resilience)
- User-controlled reminder schedule (prompts with control)

## Boundary example — “Make it addictive”

Reject deceptive/coercive patterns. Reframe toward:
- user benefit
- transparency
- opt-out controls
- guardrail metrics (complaints, opt-outs, regret)
