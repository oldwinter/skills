# Templates

Use these templates to produce the Behavioral Product Design Pack as Markdown (or as files).

## 1) Behavioral Product Design Pack (outline)

### 1. Context snapshot
- Product:
- Target user segment:
- Decision this supports:
- Constraints (platform/channels/brand/compliance):
- Baseline (funnel/retention):

### 2. Target behavior spec
- Primary target behavior (action + context + frequency):
- Success metric (primary):
- Guardrails (must not worsen):
- Who benefits (user value):
- Notes/assumptions:

### 3. Journey + moments that matter
- Journey steps (trigger → action → outcome):
- Drop-off points (top 3):
- Emotional moments (uncertainty/effort/waiting/completion):

### 4. Behavioral diagnosis (table)

| Moment | Observed issue | Likely barrier (motivation/ability/prompt/uncertainty) | Mechanism hypothesis (bias/principle) | Evidence or signal | Design implication |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

### 5. Intervention map (table)

| Idea | Moment in journey | Mechanism | User benefit | Metric impact hypothesis | Effort | Risk (trust/legal/brand) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | | |

### 6. Prioritized shortlist (top 1–3)
- Bet #1:
- Bet #2:
- Bet #3:

### 7. Behavioral design specs (1–3)
Use template #2.

### 8. Experiment + instrumentation plan
Use template #3 and #4.

### 9. Risks / Open questions / Next steps
- Risks:
- Open questions:
- Next steps:

## 2) Behavioral design spec (single intervention)

### Intervention name
- Target moment:
- Target behavior:
- Hypothesis (If we…, then…, because…):
- Behavioral mechanism(s):
- User benefit (1 sentence):

#### UX + copy
- Entry point:
- Core interaction:
- States (loading/empty/error/offline):
- Copy (draft):
- Accessibility considerations:

#### Reinforcement + resilience (if relevant)
- “Pause moment” (what/when/how often):
- “Bend not break” policy (grace/freeze/recovery/flex goal):

#### Controls + ethics
- Transparency (what’s explained to the user):
- User control (opt-out, settings, frequency):
- Potential harms + mitigations:

#### Measurement
- Primary success metric:
- Guardrails:
- Instrumentation/events needed:

#### Rollout / rollback
- Rollout plan (flags, %, cohorts):
- Stop-the-line triggers:
- Rollback plan:

## 3) Experiment plan card

- Experiment type (A/B, phased rollout, holdout, pre/post):
- Population/cohorts:
- Primary metric + expected direction:
- Guardrails:
- Duration / sample considerations:
- Risks/limitations:
- Decision rule (what means “ship”, “iterate”, “kill”):

## 4) Instrumentation spec (events)

| Event name | Trigger | Properties | Used for metric | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |
