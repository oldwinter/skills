# INTAKE (User Onboarding)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions (and label confidence).

## 1) Context
- What is the product, and what is the primary job-to-be-done?
- Who is the target user/ICP? Define 1–2 onboarding segments (e.g., “new self-serve admins”, “mobile creators”, “teams with 3–10 seats”).
- Stage: pre-PMF / early PMF / growth / mature?

## 2) Goal (make it measurable)
- What metric should improve (activation rate, signup completion, time-to-value, D1 retention)?
- What’s the baseline and target? By what date?
- Guardrails / non-goals (don’t increase drop-off, don’t increase support tickets, don’t add spammy nags, don’t degrade performance).

## 3) Current onboarding flow + biggest leak
- Where does first-time onboarding start (landing page, invite link, app store, deep link)?
- Describe the current steps/screens from entry → first value. Where do users drop the most?
- What are the top 3 user confusions/frictions you already suspect?

## 4) “Aha moment” (activation) hypotheses
- What does “success” look like for a new user in the first session/day/week?
- What behavior(s) do retained users do early (if known)?
- Any hard constraints (permissions required, data imports, integrations, teammate invites)?

## 5) Platform + UX constraints
- Web / iOS / Android / desktop? Any policy constraints (e.g., iOS permissions prompts)?
- What onboarding mechanics are allowed (guided setup, templates, checklists, demo data, progressive disclosure, lifecycle emails/push)?
- Anything you must avoid (non-native frameworks, heavy tours/carousels, incentives)?

## 6) Data & instrumentation (no secrets needed)
- What analytics stack do you use (Amplitude/Mixpanel/GA/warehouse)?
- Do you have stable user IDs across sessions/devices?
- Which events are already tracked for signup, key actions, activation, and early retention?

## 7) Capacity + timeline
- Timebox (days/weeks) and team capacity (design/eng/data)?
- Release cadence and rollout constraints (feature flags, A/B testing capability, localization)?
