# Intake (Product Vision)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and provide 2–3 options.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What is the product today, and who is the primary customer segment?** (B2B/B2C, personas, ICP, user vs buyer)
2) **What is the potent user problem / job-to-be-done?** One sentence: “<customer> struggles to ___ because ___.”
3) **What horizon should the vision target?** (default 5–10 years) and what “realistic” means in your context (regulation, market maturity, capital constraints).
4) **What is the mission / higher-level purpose?** If unclear, what’s the executive intent for why this product exists?
5) **What constraints must not break while pursuing the vision?** (trust/safety, compliance, margin, brand, performance, privacy, partner ecosystem)

## Helpful follow-ups (as needed)
- **Why now:** What changed (market/tech/behavior) that makes this vision timely?
- **Current pain:** What’s misaligned today (teams optimizing different things, roadmap churn, unclear “what good looks like”)?
- **Differentiation hypothesis:** Why will you win (unique insight, data, distribution, brand, network effects, workflow position)?
- **Strategic boundary:** What types of customers/use cases are *out of scope*?
- **Form factor:** What “product category” do users already understand? (e.g., productivity tool, CRM, marketplace, dashboard)
- **Stakeholders:** Who must agree (CEO/GM, Sales, Eng, Design, Legal, Ops)? Who will own the doc?
- **Decision tie-breakers:** Name 3 decisions the vision should settle (build vs buy, segment focus, platform vs features).

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A **Context snapshot** stating assumptions
- 2–3 **vision options** with different strategic bets
- A clear list of **open questions** that would materially change the vision
