# Checklists

Use these before you send or publish written communication.

## Universal checklist (any artifact)
- Audience is clear; the first screen answers “why am I reading this?”
- The ask is explicit (decision/action/feedback/FYI) and includes a deadline if needed
- The “how” is concrete: steps, owners, and dependencies are specified
- TL;DR exists and matches the body (no surprises)
- Scanability: headings, bullets, short paragraphs; no wall-of-text sections
- Terms, acronyms, and dates are unambiguous; key numbers are written down
- Single source of truth is linked (or created) for ongoing work
- Tone is direct and respectful; avoids blame; assumes good intent
- Safety: no secrets, credentials, or unnecessary sensitive/PII details

## Decision request checklist (email/memo)
- Options are stated (A/B/C) with your recommendation and rationale
- Tradeoffs are explicit (what you’re giving up, what you’re protecting)
- The cost of delay is stated (what happens if no decision)
- “If you disagree” path is clear (how to respond, by when)

## Status update checklist
- Status (G/Y/R) is justified with one sentence
- Asks are in a separate section with owner + date
- Blockers include what you’re doing about them (not just “blocked”)
- Next update date/cadence is stated

## Canonical doc checklist
- Owner and last updated are present
- Key links are complete and current
- Decisions are logged and easy to find
- Next steps have owners and dates
