# Intake (Question Bank)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**, then proceed. If answers remain missing, state assumptions explicitly and offer 2–3 options.

## Minimum set (use first)
1) What are we writing (email/memo/doc/status update) and where will it live (Slack, email, Notion, Google Doc)?
2) Who is the audience (roles/seniority) and what do they care about (time, risk, cost, quality, morale)?
3) What is the goal and the **ask** (inform/align/decide)? What should the reader do, by when?
4) What are the key facts that must be included (timeline, decision, constraints, numbers, links)? What must be avoided (sensitivities, legal/HR constraints, confidential info)?
5) Constraints: length, tone (direct vs warm), formatting, deadline, and any “must-include” sections.

## Helpful follow-ups (pick what’s relevant)

### If it’s a decision request
- What decision options are on the table (A/B/C) and what’s your recommendation?
- What tradeoffs matter (speed vs quality, cost vs scope, risk vs upside)?
- What happens if we don’t decide by the deadline?

### If it’s a status update
- What changed since last update (progress, metrics, decisions)?
- What’s blocked and what are you doing about it?
- What are the explicit asks (who, what, by when)?
- When is the next update, and where is the canonical doc?

### If it’s a rewrite/edit request
- What must be preserved (facts, tone, intent)? What should change (shorter, more direct, more persuasive)?
- Target reading time / length (e.g., “< 2 minutes”, “< 300 words”)?
- Any example you want to match (a prior email, style guide)?

### If it’s an ongoing project
- Do we have a **single source of truth** doc? If not, where should it live and who owns updates?
- What links must be included (PRD/spec, tracker, decision log, dashboard)?
