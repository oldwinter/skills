# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands `../SKILL.md` with extra heuristics for building the story, de-risking, and rehearsing.

## Step 1 — Lock the objective and the ask
Common failure mode: “update” talks with no outcome.

Heuristics:
- If the outcome is “inform”, still define what you want people to **do next** (even “be aware of X risk”).
- Make the ask binary when possible: approve / decide / pick / commit / schedule.

## Step 2 — Use contrast to make the story persuasive
Use “**what is** vs **what could be**” to create tension and a reason to care:
- What is: the current reality (constraints, costs, user pain, risks).
- What could be: the improved future (outcomes, benefits, avoided risks).

Checks:
- The “what is” is evidenced (a metric, a quote, a concrete example).
- The “what could be” is specific (not “better”, but “reduce X from A → B”).

## Step 3 — Map the narrative to a structure that fits time
Practical structure patterns:
- **Context → Tension → Proposal → Proof → Ask**
- **What is → What could be → What stands in the way → What we’ll do → Ask**
- **Story → Lesson → Data → Decision**

Time budgeting:
- Keep a buffer (10–20% of time) for questions and transitions.
- Prefer fewer slides with clean takeaways over dense decks.

## Step 4 — Make it sayable (talk track > prose)
Guidelines:
- Speaker notes should be **bullets**, not paragraphs.
- Slides carry the **takeaway**; you provide the nuance.
- If you find yourself reading, rewrite the slide to be a prompt, not a script.

## Step 5 — Role-play objections and build your Q&A bank
De-risk by impersonating your audience:
- Write the hardest questions as if asked by specific stakeholders (“CFO: why spend now?”).
- Draft a crisp answer + supporting proof + a fallback follow-up.

Checks:
- You can answer the top questions in 20–40 seconds each.
- You have a plan for unknowns (“I’ll confirm and follow up by DATE”).

## Step 6 — Pre-brief to avoid surprises (especially for decisions)
Pre-brief goals:
- Surface objections early
- Give decision-makers a chance to shape the ask before the meeting
- Reduce live-meeting drama

Checklist:
- Pre-brief the people most likely to say “no” first.
- Track changes: what you updated based on feedback (and what you didn’t).

## Step 7 — Rehearse: visualize, record, and iterate
Confidence comes from reps.

Rehearsal stack (in order):
1) **Visualization**: mentally walk through the room/Zoom flow, from start to finish.
2) **Timed run**: speak the talk out loud, end-to-end.
3) **Record + review**: listen/watch, fix pacing and filler words.
4) **Hard-mode Q&A**: role-play interruptions and skeptical questions.

Delivery cue (especially on Zoom):
- When thinking, **look up** (not down) to project confidence and avoid seeming distracted.

## Step 8 — Final quality gate + logistics
Final checks:
- Backups: local copy, PDF export, and offline access to key evidence
- Zoom: lighting, camera angle, mic, screen share permissions
- In-person: clicker, adapter, stage/room walk-through if possible

Run [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) + [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md) before finalizing.
