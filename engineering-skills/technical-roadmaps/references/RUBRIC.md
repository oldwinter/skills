# Rubric (Technical Roadmaps)

Score each dimension 1–5. A strong pack is **≥4** on most dimensions and **no 1s**.

## 1) Diagnosis quality
1: Vague (“we need to improve reliability”) with no evidence.  
3: Some evidence, but missing key constraints or “why now”.  
5: Specific constraints with clear evidence and urgency.

## 2) Guiding policy coherence
1: A list of slogans; doesn’t constrain choices.  
3: Some principles, but too many or inconsistent.  
5: 3–5 crisp principles that clearly drive decisions.

## 3) Actionability of coherent actions
1: Wishlist; no owners, deps, or milestones.  
3: Some execution detail, but sequencing unclear.  
5: Executable plan with owners, deps, milestones, and decision gates.

## 4) Alignment and stakeholder usefulness
1: Written for the wrong audience; no decision ask.  
3: Audience is implied; decisions unclear.  
5: Audience + decision are explicit; stakeholders can approve/critique async.

## 5) Feasibility and trade-offs
1: Ignores capacity/constraints; no trade-offs.  
3: Mentions constraints, but doesn’t change plan.  
5: Plan reflects constraints; non-goals/cut list is explicit.

## 6) Measurability and risk management
1: No success metrics; risks missing.  
3: Some metrics/risks, but shallow or unowned.  
5: Metrics (baseline → target) + risk register with owners and mitigations.

## Ship / no-ship guidance
- **Ship:** No 1s, and at least four dimensions are 4–5.
- **Revise:** Any 1, or more than two dimensions at 3 or below.
