# Rubric (Scoring)

Score each dimension **1–5**. A “ship-ready” pack is typically **≥ 22/30** with no dimension below **3**.

## 1) Scope clarity (1–5)
- 1: Vague scope; unclear audiences and boundaries.
- 3: Clear scope and audiences; some edge cases unresolved.
- 5: Crystal clear scope, boundaries, and when-not-to-use guidance.

## 2) Operational leverage (1–5)
- 1: No clear operational hook; unclear why the system will be adopted.
- 3: Hook is stated; first slice is defined but could be tighter.
- 5: Strong hook with a narrow, high-leverage first slice and clear success signals.

## 3) Token architecture (1–5)
- 1: Tokens are ad-hoc or missing; components hard-code values.
- 3: Token taxonomy exists; some state/theming/a11y gaps remain.
- 5: Robust taxonomy with semantic/state tokens (incl. elevation/depth where needed) and explicit a11y rules.

## 4) Component roadmap executability (1–5)
- 1: Wishlist; no milestones/owners/acceptance criteria.
- 3: Roadmap exists; milestones are reasonable but acceptance criteria are partial.
- 5: Incremental milestones with clear acceptance criteria and rollback/stop conditions.

## 5) Documentation usability (1–5)
- 1: Docs are abstract; no examples; hard for new users.
- 3: Docs cover basics; some gaps in recipes/guardrails.
- 5: Example-first docs with recipes/templates and guardrails that make correct usage easy.

## 6) Governance + adoption plan (1–5)
- 1: No owner; no contribution path; adoption is assumed.
- 3: Governance exists; adoption tactics are partial.
- 5: Clear decision rights + contribution workflow + champion plan + release cadence.
