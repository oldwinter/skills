# Intake (Question Bank)

Ask up to **5** questions at a time, then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Quick scope
1) What product is this for, and what platforms are in scope (web/iOS/Android/email/docs)?
2) Who are the primary users of the design system (designers, engineers, PMs, “non-designers”, external partners)?
3) Are we creating a new system or evolving an existing one? What’s the current maturity (tokens/components/docs/governance)?

## Current state + pain
4) Where does the system live today (Figma library, Storybook, code components, docs site)? What’s out of sync?
5) What are the top 3 UI consistency problems (spacing, typography, color, components, interaction patterns)?
6) What slows teams down most today (handoffs, review churn, custom UI, lack of patterns, accessibility bugs)?

## Goals + constraints
7) What is the “why now” (new product surface, redesign, scaling team, enterprise deals, rebrand)?
8) What does success look like in 4–8 weeks (adoption target, cycle-time improvement, bug reduction, fewer one-off styles)?
9) Constraints: timeline, staffing, who owns the system, and how much engineering support is available?

## Visual direction + future-proofing
10) Any constraints or goals for visual style (brand requirements, “more depth/texture/motion”, theming, dark mode)?
11) Accessibility requirements (WCAG level, reduced motion, contrast targets, keyboard support)?

## Adoption + governance
12) Who will make decisions and review contributions? Any known champions or teams who will adopt first?
13) Do you need enterprise features (theming, customization, multiple brands, white-labeling)? If yes, what’s the buyer/user pain?

## Safe defaults (if unknown)
- Assume: modern web app, Figma component library, engineering builds a component library, and the initial goal is consistency + faster shipping.
