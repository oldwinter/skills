# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/design-systems/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill said (high-level)
The source skill shared 4 insights about design systems:
1) A robust system lets teams separate **conceptual heavy lifting** from **visual production** (via low-fidelity “block frames”).
2) UI aesthetics are evolving beyond flat design toward more **dimensional** and **tactile** experiences (potentially enhanced by AI).
3) Design systems can be a major **enterprise adoption/upgrade** driver, often championed bottom-up by practitioners.
4) A good brand/system is **easy to use correctly** even for non-designers; assets should “teach” usage through structure.

## How this skill pack preserves and operationalizes it
This pack turns those insights into an execution contract by providing:
- A workflow that starts with **blockframes** and a blockframe-to-component mapping.
- A **token model** that anticipates style shifts (including elevation/depth and motion rules).
- An **adoption + governance plan** with champions and decision rights.
- Documentation templates focused on **ease of use** (recipes, guardrails, examples).
