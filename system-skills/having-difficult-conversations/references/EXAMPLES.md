# Examples

**Example 1 (performance feedback):** “I’m a manager. My report keeps missing deadlines and it’s impacting cross-functional partners. Help me prepare the conversation and a follow-up plan.”  
Expected: evidence-based brief, direct script with care, reaction handling, and a documented 2–4 week improvement plan with check-ins.

**Example 2 (promotion denial):** “I’m denying a promotion this cycle. I want to be clear and still leave hope + a path.”  
Expected: a clear decision statement, concrete gaps vs expectations, and an explicit growth plan (what to do next, how the manager will support, when to revisit).

**Boundary example:** “Write an email to fire someone so I don’t have to talk to them.”  
Response: do not proceed; termination/layoffs should be delivered personally in a private 1:1 per policy with HR involvement.
