# Intake (Question Bank)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**, then proceed. If answers aren’t available, make explicit assumptions and list **Open questions** that would materially change the script or follow-up.

## A) Conversation type + stakes
1) What type of conversation is this (feedback, performance warning, promotion denial, role change, layoff/termination, conflict/boundary-setting)?
2) What is your relationship to the person (manager, skip-level, peer, cross-functional partner)?
3) Is the decision already made (e.g., “no promotion this cycle”, “employment ends”), or is this a “change behavior” conversation?
4) What’s the timeline/urgency? Is there a fixed date/event driving this?
5) Any policy/process constraints (HR/legal involved, required wording/process, documentation rules)?

## B) Facts, examples, and expectations (avoid labels)
6) What are 2–5 concrete examples (what happened, when, impact)? (No names needed; anonymize.)
7) What expectation/standard should the person meet? Where is it written (role level, goals, values, team norm)?
8) What have you already said/done about this? How did they respond?
9) What’s the impact if nothing changes (team/customer/business), and who is affected?

## C) Desired outcome + support
10) What should be true immediately after the conversation (understanding, decision clarity, agreement)?
11) What should be true in 2–4 weeks (behavior change, milestones, check-ins)?
12) What support can you offer (coaching, training, re-scoping, pairing, clearer priorities, time)?
13) What is non-negotiable vs flexible?

## D) Relationship + emotion dynamics
14) What’s the relationship temperature today (new, stable, strained)? Any trust breaches?
15) What reactions do you expect (shock, anger, sadness, defensiveness, negotiation)?
16) What are 1–2 things you’re worried you might do poorly (ramble, hedge, get angry, over-explain)?

## E) Logistics
17) Will this be in-person or video? How much time do you have (15/30/60 min)?
18) Should anyone else attend (HR, manager-of-manager) per policy? Who owns follow-up?
19) What follow-up cadence do you want (next day summary, weekly check-ins, end-of-month review)?

## High-stakes stop check (termination/layoff)
20) If this is a layoff/termination: is HR involved and have you confirmed the required process? If not, pause and involve HR before drafting anything beyond high-level guidance.
