# Checklists (Quality Gates)

Use these checklists before finalizing a pack. If a “Stop” item is triggered, pause and request clarification or route to HR/legal.

## 1) Prep checklist (before the meeting)
- [ ] I can state the **type** of conversation and the **desired outcome** in one sentence.
- [ ] I have 2–5 **specific examples** (observable, time-bounded) and I can separate facts vs interpretations.
- [ ] I can state the **expectation/standard** clearly (what “good” looks like).
- [ ] The **non-negotiable** (if any) is explicit and consistent with policy.
- [ ] I know what **support** I can offer (and what I cannot).
- [ ] I chose a **private setting** with enough time and no interruptions.
- [ ] I have a follow-up plan (summary note + check-in cadence).

### Stop (policy/safety)
- [ ] STOP: This involves harassment/discrimination/threats/investigation → route to HR/legal process.
- [ ] STOP: This is termination/layoff and HR/process is not confirmed → involve HR before proceeding.

## 2) Script checklist (message quality)
- [ ] The key message is deliverable in **1–2 sentences** without hedging.
- [ ] The script is **direct and respectful** (care personally + challenge directly).
- [ ] Evidence is limited to 2–5 examples (no “kitchen-sinking”).
- [ ] I included **pauses** and I’m prepared to let silence happen.
- [ ] I avoided labels and attributions (“you are…” / “I feel you…”).
- [ ] For disappointing decisions (e.g., promotion denial), I included **hope + a path** (what changes, how support works, when revisit).
- [ ] Boundaries are clear (what is not up for debate).

## 3) Delivery checklist (during the meeting)
- [ ] I opened with intent and set a respectful tone.
- [ ] I delivered the key message early, then paused.
- [ ] I acknowledged emotion without walking back the core message.
- [ ] I stayed on facts and impact; I didn’t argue or litigate every point.
- [ ] I confirmed understanding (“What are you hearing me say?”).
- [ ] We ended with explicit next steps, owners, and dates.

## 4) Follow-up checklist (after the meeting)
- [ ] I sent a brief written recap within 24 hours (aligned with policy).
- [ ] Next check-in is scheduled (date/time).
- [ ] I documented agreements and metrics (if relevant) in an appropriate system.
- [ ] I identified follow-up risks and escalation paths.
