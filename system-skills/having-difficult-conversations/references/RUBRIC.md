# Rubric (Score the Pack)

Score each dimension 1–5. A “pass” is **≥ 4 average** with **no dimension below 3**, and **no triggered Stop items** in [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md).

## 1) Clarity + directness
1: Message is vague/hedged; the person won’t know what’s being asked/decided.  
3: Message is mostly clear but rambly or buried.  
5: Key message is explicit and early; boundaries and next steps are unmistakable.

## 2) Care + respect (dignity)
1: Dismissive, cold, or adversarial tone; ignores emotion.  
3: Polite but emotionally unaware or overly clinical.  
5: Respectful and humane; acknowledges emotion while staying firm on the core message.

## 3) Specificity + fairness
1: Uses labels/character judgments; no concrete examples.  
3: Some examples, but mixed with interpretation or excessive volume.  
5: 2–5 observable examples tied to impact and expectations; avoids “kitchen-sinking.”

## 4) Safety + policy alignment
1: Ignores HR/legal/process risk; includes unsafe advice.  
3: Mentions policy but lacks clear gates.  
5: Clear stop checks; routes high-risk items appropriately; avoids policy improvisation.

## 5) Emotion + objection handling
1: No plan for reactions; likely to escalate conflict.  
3: Generic empathy; doesn’t handle defensiveness well.  
5: Anticipates likely reactions; includes concrete response moves and anchor phrases.

## 6) Follow-up system
1: No next steps or accountability.  
3: Next steps exist but are vague or unscheduled.  
5: Written follow-up note + clear check-in cadence + measurable expectations (when relevant).

## Red flags (automatic revision required)
- The “ask/decision” is unclear or delayed until the end.
- Script contains labels (“lazy”, “not a leader”) instead of observable behaviors.
- Suggests delivering termination/layoff news via email/group message.
- Missing follow-up plan or dates.
