# Intake (Question Bank)

Ask up to 5 questions at a time. If answers are missing, proceed with explicit assumptions and label confidence.

## A) Goal + constraints (required)
1) What is the growth goal (metric + target + date)? (e.g., WAU, revenue, activated users)
2) Which segment(s) matter most right now (ICP, persona, geo, plan tier)?
3) What are the key constraints: budget, team capacity, brand risk, platform policies, legal/privacy, timebox?
4) Are we optimizing an existing loop, or do we need a new loop? (If unclear, default to a balanced plan.)

## B) Product + value moment (required)
5) What is the “core value moment” (the action that means the user got value)?
6) What is the primary user job-to-be-done / use case?
7) What are the top reasons users churn or don’t activate (if known)?

## C) Baseline growth system (best available)
8) What currently drives acquisition? (top 3 sources + rough volumes)
9) What does the funnel look like? (visit → signup → activation → retained)
10) What retention/engagement proxy do you have (e.g., D7/D30, WAU/MAU, repeat purchase)?
11) Do users share/invite today? If yes, how often and through what mechanism?

## D) Unit economics (needed for paid loops)
12) Rough LTV (or ARPA × gross margin × expected lifetime) and CAC today (if any)?
13) Any payback constraints? (e.g., 3 months, 12 months)
14) Gross margin and variable costs that affect paid viability?

## E) Channels + distribution context
15) Which channels have you tried and what happened?
16) Where does your audience already spend attention? (communities, platforms, search, partners)
17) Any channel-specific strengths/weaknesses? (e.g., strong content, strong product virality, strong sales motion)

## F) Measurement + tooling
18) What analytics tooling exists today (events, attribution, dashboards)?
19) Any known instrumentation gaps that make measurement hard?

## Data handling rules
- Do not request secrets (API keys, tokens).
- If the user data includes PII, ask for aggregated metrics or redacted excerpts.
