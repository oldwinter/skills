# SOURCE_SUMMARY (Retention & Engagement)

## Source
- `sources/refound/raw/retention-engagement/SKILL.md`

The downloaded source skill is insight-heavy and includes a short subset of guest insights. It references a deeper “guest insights” file that is not present in the local source folder.

## Preserved insights → executable rules

| Source insight | Rule (DO / DO NOT) | Check (how we know) | Where it appears |
|---|---|---|---|
| Retention is the primary driver (subscription businesses). | **DO** prioritize retention improvements before aggressive day-one monetization changes. | A retention hypothesis/experiment exists before major paywall optimization; guardrails include revenue + trust. | `../SKILL.md` Steps 1, 3, 6; [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md) (guardrails) |
| Products retain when they get better with use; “mounting loss.” | **DO** design accruing value (history, progress, personalization) and ethical switching costs; **DO NOT** use hostage tactics. | Users can articulate “what I’ve built here”; user control exists (export/visibility) where relevant. | `../SKILL.md` Step 5; [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) (accruing value); [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) (ethics) |
| Habit formation: daily return is a core problem. | **DO** design for “come back tomorrow” with cues, low friction, and clear next actions. | Leading indicators improve (next-day return, weekly frequency) alongside guardrails. | `../SKILL.md` Step 5; [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) (habit) |
| Onboarding is a high-leverage retention lever; get to aha fast. | **DO** reduce time-to-value and make the aha moment reliable. | Time-to-value decreases; activation rate increases; cohorts improve. | `../SKILL.md` Steps 3–6; [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) (onboarding) |
| Aha moment should be defined with data and thresholds. | **DO** define activation as a measurable behavior threshold correlated with retention. | Activation definition separates retained vs churned cohorts and is validated/revised based on data. | `../SKILL.md` Step 4; [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) (activation) |

## What this skill pack adds beyond the source
- A clear scope + boundary (“when to use / when not to use”).
- An input/output contract and an artifact-driven workflow.
- Templates for a Retention & Engagement Improvement Pack and experiment cards.
- Quality gates (checklists + rubric) and required “Risks / Open questions / Next steps.”
