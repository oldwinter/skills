## 1) Problem fit (0–2)
- Retention/engagement/activation scope is correct; boundaries are explicit.

## 2) Input contract (0–2)
- Minimal required inputs are listed; missing-info strategy follows “ask up to 5, then assume.”

## 3) Metric clarity (0–2)
- Retention/engagement/activation metrics are explicitly defined (behavior, segment, window).

## 4) Diagnosis quality (0–2)
- Primary failure mode + biggest leak are identified with evidence.

## 5) Activation/aha definition (0–2)
- Behavioral activation definition + validation plan are present.

## 6) Insight-to-action mapping (0–2)
- Hypotheses are converted into rules + checks and tied to failure modes.

## 7) Experiment design (0–2)
- Experiment cards have hypothesis, metrics, guardrails, instrumentation, rollout/rollback.

## 8) Prioritization (0–2)
- Backlog is prioritized with a transparent method and feasible top 3.

## 9) Execution plan (0–2)
- 30/60/90 plan is sequenced, dependency-aware, and measurable.

## 10) Safety + trust (0–2)
- Avoids dark patterns; respects privacy; includes user-control guardrails for “mounting loss.”
