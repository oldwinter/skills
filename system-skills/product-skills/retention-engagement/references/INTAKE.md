# INTAKE (Retention & Engagement)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions (and label confidence).

## 1) Context
- What is the product, and what is the primary job-to-be-done?
- Who is the target user/ICP? Define 1–2 key segments to analyze (e.g., “new self-serve SMB admins”, “paid subscribers”, “teams with 3–10 seats”).
- Stage: pre-PMF / early PMF / growth / mature?

## 2) The goal (make it measurable)
- What metric do you want to move (D1/D7/D30 retention, weekly retention, churn, WAU, DAU/MAU, activation rate)?
- By when (date) and by how much (baseline → target)?
- Any non-goals or guardrails (e.g., don’t reduce revenue, don’t increase support tickets, don’t spam users)?

## 3) Baseline metrics (best available)
Provide rough numbers if exact metrics aren’t available.
- Retention: D1/D7/D30 (or weekly cohort retention) by segment
- Engagement: DAU/WAU/MAU, WAU/MAU, sessions/week, key actions/week
- Activation: current activation rate + how you currently define activation (if defined)
- Time-to-value: median time/session count to first meaningful value
- Churn: voluntary vs involuntary (if subscription), churn timing distribution

## 4) The journey + drop-offs
- Describe the onboarding path (steps/screens) and where users drop.
- What is the “first value” moment today (even if informal)?
- Where does engagement decay (day 2, week 2, month 2)?

## 5) Qualitative signals (optional but helpful)
- Top 3 reasons users churn or disengage (support tickets, exit surveys, sales calls, reviews)?
- What do retained users say they love / rely on?

## 6) Constraints + channels
- What channels are available: in-product, email, push, SMS, sales/CS touches?
- Constraints: engineering/design capacity, release cadence, brand, legal/privacy, platform policies.
- Any “do not do” list (dark patterns, nags, incentives, pricing changes)?

## 7) Data access (no secrets needed)
- What analytics stack do you use (e.g., Amplitude/Mixpanel/GA + warehouse)?
- Do you have stable user IDs across devices/sessions?
- Are key events instrumented for activation and retention analysis?
