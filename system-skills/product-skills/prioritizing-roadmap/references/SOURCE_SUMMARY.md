Note: The Refound skill references `references/guest-insights.md`, but that file was not available in the repository. This skill pack preserves the “Top Insights” that are present and adds executable structure (contracts, workflow, templates, checklists).

## Preserved insights → rules/checks

### 1) Structure inputs by conviction level (truth vs hypotheses)
Source: Alex Hardimen
- **Rule:** Every roadmap input must be tagged as Known/Belief/Hypothesis with a short evidence summary.
- **Check:** Can stakeholders distinguish “what we know” from “what we’re betting on” in the opportunity inventory?

### 2) Use “seasons” to align teams in fast-changing contexts
Source: Asha Sharma
- **Rule:** Every prioritization cycle must include a season framing: why now, bets, and non-goals.
- **Check:** Can a stakeholder restate the season and what’s explicitly out of scope?

### 3) Maintain a rolling plan refreshed on a fixed cadence
Source: Brian Chesky
- **Rule:** Keep a rolling horizon plan (e.g., 12–24 months) and refresh it on a predictable cadence (e.g., every ~6 months).
- **Check:** Does the roadmap include a refresh cadence and triggers?

### 4) Use a “common currency” to compare cross-team projects
Source: Dan Hockenmaier
- **Rule:** Prioritization must define a common currency and an explicit model/assumption set to compare impacts across teams.
- **Check:** Can you compare two initiatives from different teams without changing the scoring logic?

### 5) Explicitly ask for “Think Bigger” ideas
Source: Eeke de Milliano
- **Rule:** Every roadmap pack must include a “Think Bigger” section that captures big-bet ideas separately from the committed plan.
- **Check:** Does the pack include 3–5 big-bet ideas with a concrete discovery next step?
