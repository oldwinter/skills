Product-Led Sales Strategy  Product-led sales (PLS) is a go-to-market motion that sits between pure product-led growth and traditional sales. It converts organic self-serve usage into sales opportunities by attaching salespeople to close larger contracts. This requires unique metrics (PQAs), different organizational accountability, and a new kind of sales motion.

Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 2 experts.

1 Convert self-serve usage into sales opportunities  Product-led sales doesn't replace self-serve - it builds on top of it. Your product generates usage and engagement, and PLS identifies which accounts show buying signals. The sales team then reaches out to help close larger deals, not to generate initial interest from scratch.

Featured guest perspectives

"Product-led sales converts the usage that you've generated via self-serve into a sales opportunity and it attaches a salesperson to close a much larger contract."

— Elena Verna        2 Use product signals to trigger sales outreach  Build systems that surface Product Qualified Accounts (PQAs) or Product Qualified Leads (PQLs) based on usage data. When an account shows specific behaviors - hitting feature limits, adding team members, exploring enterprise features - that's the trigger for sales to reach out with context about what they were doing.

Featured guest perspectives

"How the product led funnel work for us is... our sales team get that data signal, they may send an email and reach out and say, 'Hey, I saw you were checking it out. How can I help?'"

— Hila Qu        3 Make Product own the top of the funnel  Unlike traditional sales where marketing generates leads, in PLS the product team owns generating usage and engagement. Product is accountable for the quality and quantity of PQAs. Sales is accountable for conversion rates, not lead generation. This shift in accountability is fundamental to making PLS work.

✗ Common Mistakes

Treating PLS as traditional sales with a different nameHaving sales reach out too early before users have experienced valueNot building the infrastructure to surface product-qualified signalsKeeping traditional sales metrics instead of developing PQA/PQL frameworks     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

Sales conversations feel like natural extensions of product usage, not cold outreachYou have clear PQA/PQL definitions based on usage patternsConversion rates from PQL to closed deal are significantly higher than traditional leadsProduct and sales teams have shared accountability and clear handoff criteria
