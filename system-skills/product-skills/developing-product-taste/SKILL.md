Developing Product Taste  Product taste is the ability to identify what's really good without needing to see results. It's not an innate trait but a developable skill built through exposure, observation, and building a repertoire. In an era of AI-generated content, taste is the critical differentiator that sets great products apart.

Read Guide

The Guide  6 key steps synthesized from 10 experts.

1 Recognize taste as a learnable skill  Taste is not an inaccessible gift that some people are born with. It's a skill developed through 'exposure hours' - analyzing the best products in the world and understanding why they work. Treat taste development like any other skill that improves with deliberate practice.

Featured guest perspectives

"Taste, sometimes I think we think of as this inaccessible thing that, 'Oh, that person was born with taste.' I see it as a skill that it can develop."

— Guillermo Rauch    "Taste is about the ability to identify what is really good, without needing to see its results."

— Shreyas Doshi        2 Be a voracious user of products  There's no replacement for being a heavy user of many products. The 'cheat code' for building great products is developing muscle memory and intuition through constant product usage. Use products obsessively, notice what works and what doesn't, and let those patterns inform your own work.

Featured guest perspectives

"The best cheat codes for getting better at building products is just being a voracious user of products... There's just no replacement for that."

— Kayvon Beykpour        3 Build your repertoire and understand the canon  Taste is your point of view on things, developed by understanding the history and context that led to current products. Study the 'canon' - the foundational products and design decisions in your space. Know where you agree or disagree philosophically with established approaches.

Featured guest perspectives

"Taste is your point of view on things and how do you develop your point of view... build your repertoire. Understand what is the greater context, what is the canon that led to this thing, and where do you disagree or agree philosophically?"

— Dylan Field        4 Start with self-observation  The foundation of product sense is observation and curiosity, beginning with yourself. Notice your own reactions to products - what frustrates you, what delights you, what you skip over. Then validate those observations qualitatively and quantitatively to build conviction.

Featured guest perspectives

"The number one advice... is it's just really about observation and it's about curiosity and can start by first observing yourself."

— Julie Zhuo        5 Use intuition as a hypothesis generator  Think of intuition as a hypothesis generator, not an oracle. You're constantly generating hypotheses about what will work based on pattern recognition. Test those hypotheses, but trust that well-developed intuition provides valuable signal, especially for decisions that are hard to A/B test.

Featured guest perspectives

"I think intuition is like a hypothesis generator and you're constantly generating these hypotheses and others are generating hypotheses as well."

— Dylan Field    "Then we think you can much more use your intuition or thinking to do those decisions so you don't have to use data or metrics to back those things up."

— Karri Saarinen        6 Develop a first-party perspective  A PM cannot outsource their perspective or delegate their thinking through people and process. You must develop your own informed point of view through understanding human motivations - why someone wants to click a button, why they want to join a team. This 'feel' goes beyond what metrics can tell you.

Featured guest perspectives

"A PM cannot outsource their perspective or delegate their thinking through people and process."

— Naomi Gleit    "You need to understand motivations in people for building products... why does somebody want to click on a button, why does somebody want to join your team?"

— Tamar Yehoshua

✗ Common Mistakes

Believing taste is innate rather than a developable skillOutsourcing product judgment to data or process rather than building your own perspectiveNot using enough products deeply to develop pattern recognitionFocusing only on your own product category rather than building broad repertoireTreating intuition as truth rather than as hypotheses to test     ✓ Signs You're Doing It Well

You can articulate why a product decision is good before seeing resultsYou have a clear point of view that sometimes differs from conventional wisdomYour intuition generates hypotheses that frequently validate when testedYou can identify quality in products outside your immediate domainPeople seek out your opinion on product decisions because your taste is trusted
