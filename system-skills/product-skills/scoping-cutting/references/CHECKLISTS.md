# Checklists (Scoping & Cutting)

Use these before finalizing the Scoping & Cutting Pack.

## 1) Appetite + decision checklist
- Decision is explicit (ship/defer/stop) and has a DRI
- Appetite/time budget or ship date is explicit
- Non-negotiable constraints are listed (privacy/legal/reliability/platform)

## 2) Hypothesis-first MVP checklist
- Outcome is written in user terms (not feature terms)
- 1–3 hypotheses are stated clearly
- Success metric(s) + guardrails are measurable and defined
- Failure criteria are stated (what would invalidate the approach)

## 3) Minimum Lovable Slice (MLS) checklist
- Slice is end-to-end (a user can complete a core job)
- Must-haves are short and fit the appetite
- Non-goals are explicit and defensible
- “Lovability” elements increase clarity/trust (not random polish)

## 4) Cut list checklist
- Every cut/defer has a rationale tied to outcome/appetite
- Edge cases are handled explicitly (cut/defer/keep) rather than ignored
- Each deferred item has a “revisit when…” trigger
- No “just in case” scope without evidence

## 5) Validation plan checklist
- Top 1–3 riskiest assumptions are identified
- Method is the fastest path to learning (prototype/concierge/WoZ)
- Success and failure criteria are defined in advance
- Timeline, audience, and script/flow are included

## 6) Scope-change guardrails checklist
- Rule is clear: new work requires trading off existing scope
- Decision owner and escalation path are defined
- Default trade-off order is defined (what gets cut first)
- Stakeholders know where requests go and how they’re decided

## 7) Finalization checklist
- Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** with owners and dates
- Assumptions are labeled and reviewable
- A stakeholder can approve the slice async without a meeting
