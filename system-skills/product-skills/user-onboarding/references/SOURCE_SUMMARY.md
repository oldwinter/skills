# SOURCE SUMMARY (Refound/Lenny → User Onboarding)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/user-onboarding/SKILL.md`

## Original insights (preserved)

- **Onboarding is a major unlock** even when product features exist: onboarding can be “the thing holding people back.” (Cam Adams)
- The biggest retention wins often come from **inflecting the early user experience**. (Dan Hockenmaier)
- Optimize the **first 30 seconds** to feel “magical,” and treat onboarding like the “first mile” that drives word-of-mouth. (Grant Lee)
- Apply **game design principles**: onboarding should be part of the product experience; avoid common traps like passive carousels and non-native experiences. (Merci Grace)

## How the skill pack transforms insights into execution

Each insight becomes a rule + check + artifact:

1) **Rule:** Treat onboarding as a core product surface, not an afterthought.  
   **Check:** Biggest onboarding leak is identified and tied to a concrete fix plan.  
   **Artifact:** FTUE Journey Map + Friction Log (`references/TEMPLATES.md`).

2) **Rule:** Optimize for early experience → activation → early retention.  
   **Check:** Activation (“aha moment”) is defined behaviorally and has a validation plan.  
   **Artifact:** Activation / Aha Moment Spec (`references/TEMPLATES.md`).

3) **Rule:** Make the first 30 seconds deliver a fast, interactive win.  
   **Check:** First-win event is measurable and realistic; non-essential setup is deferred.  
   **Artifact:** First 30 Seconds Spec (`references/TEMPLATES.md`).

4) **Rule:** Design the “first mile” as milestones to activation with feedback and progress.  
   **Check:** 3–6 milestones; each has mechanics + leading metrics; no “tour-only” steps.  
   **Artifact:** First Mile Plan (`references/TEMPLATES.md`).

5) **Rule:** Make onboarding improvements testable and measurable.  
   **Check:** Every experiment has a primary metric + guardrail + rollout/rollback.  
   **Artifact:** Experiment Card + Measurement Plan (`references/TEMPLATES.md`).

## Notes on boundaries
- This skill is strictly **product user onboarding** (FTUE), not HR onboarding.
- If ICP/value prop is unclear, route to `problem-definition` or `measuring-product-market-fit`.
- If broad retention beyond onboarding is the goal, route to `retention-engagement`.
