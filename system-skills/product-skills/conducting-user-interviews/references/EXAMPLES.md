# Examples (Conducting User Interviews)

These examples are written as **user prompts** and the expected **artifact outputs**.

## Example 1 — B2B onboarding discovery

**Prompt**
“I’m a PM for a B2B SaaS product. Our activation rate dropped after we changed onboarding. I need to run 8 interviews with new trial users this week. Create a recruiting plan, screener, and a 45-minute discovery interview guide. Recording is allowed.”

**Expected outputs**
- Context snapshot with the decision (onboarding changes) and learning goals
- Participant criteria (trial users in last 7–14 days; include 1–2 failed activations)
- Recruiting plan (channels + outreach copy + scheduling plan)
- Screener screening for recency + activation attempt
- Story-first guide focused on “last time you tried to get set up…”
- Notes template + tagging
- Synthesis plan and readout outline

## Example 2 — Switch interviews vs spreadsheets

**Prompt**
“We sell a workflow tool but customers keep sticking with spreadsheets. I want 10 switch interviews with teams who recently moved off spreadsheets (to any tool, not necessarily ours). Create a JTBD switch interview guide and recruiting plan.”

**Expected outputs**
- Inclusion criteria emphasizing recency and an actual switch
- Outreach copy that doesn’t pitch your product
- JTBD switch guide capturing push/pull/anxieties/habits and the triggering event
- Synthesis structure that outputs forces and decision criteria

## Boundary example — Feature request fishing

**Prompt**
“Interview users to ask what features to build next and then pick the top requests.”

**Expected response**
- Clarify the decision and target segment; propose a story-first protocol to uncover struggles/outcomes
- Explain why “feature requests” are weak evidence; redirect to behavioral questions
- Provide an alternative plan: discovery interviews + lightweight quant follow-up if needed
