# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance, interview patterns, and decision heuristics.

## Step 1 — Frame the decision (avoid “anecdote collecting”)
Before writing questions, anchor on:
- The **decision** (what will change)
- The **unknowns** (what you genuinely don’t know)
- The **interview type** best suited to the decision

Heuristic: If you can’t name the decision, you’ll end up with nice stories and no follow-through.

## Step 2 — Pick participants who can tell the right story
Prioritize participants by **recency** when relevant:
- Switch interviews: recently adopted a new solution or seriously evaluated alternatives
- Churn interviews: churned in the last 30–90 days (or immediately after a key event)
- Onboarding interviews: tried onboarding within the last 1–14 days

Include 1–2 deliberate “edge cases” (power users, skeptics, failed adopters) to surface constraints.

## Step 3 — Recruit with volume and clarity
Expect rejection/indifference. Plan for drop-off:
- Target 10–20 outreach messages to book 1 interview (varies by audience)
- Use clear, respectful outreach: purpose, time, confidentiality, incentive (if any), and “why them”

If you can, build a small pool of “text-message friendly” highly engaged users for fast feedback loops.

## Step 4 — Run story-first interviews (avoid opinions)
Default question style:
- “Tell me about the **last time** you…”
- “Walk me through what happened **step by step**.”
- “What triggered it? What did you try? What got in the way?”
- “What did you do instead? Why?”

Avoid:
- “Would you use…?” (hypothetical)
- “Do you like…?” (preference without context)
- Leading prompts that embed a solution (“What if we added feature X…”)

## Step 5 — Capture evidence as you go
In your notes:
- Separate **verbatim quotes** from interpretation
- Capture the full “story arc”: trigger → struggle → workaround → outcome
- Mark confidence: repeated pattern vs single anecdote vs speculation

Where possible, ensure PM + design observe live or listen to recordings to reduce “telephone game” loss.

## Step 6 — Debrief immediately
Right after each session, capture:
- Top 3 surprises
- Top 3 follow-ups (what to verify in the next interviews)
- Hypotheses updated (validated / invalidated / unclear)

This keeps the interview set adaptive while staying within the scope.

## Step 7 — Synthesize into decisions
Synthesis that drives action includes:
- Thematic clusters tied to outcomes/constraints
- Evidence strength (counts, quotes, examples)
- Contradictions and segmentation (“this is true for X, not for Y”)
- Opportunities framed as “If we improve X, we enable outcome Y”

Heuristic: If you can’t propose a next action, you probably only summarized.

## Step 8 — Follow-up and build a customer panel habit
Close the loop quickly:
- Thank participants
- Share what you can (high-level learnings, not confidential internal plans)
- Invite 5–10 engaged participants into a lightweight panel (opt-in, respectful cadence)

Run the quality gate ([CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) + [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md)) before finalizing the pack.
