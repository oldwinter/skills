# Checklists (Conducting User Interviews)

Use these checklists before finalizing your **User Interview Pack**.

## A) Scope + decision checklist
- [ ] A specific decision is named and time-bounded.
- [ ] The interview type matches the decision (discovery vs switch vs churn vs concept).
- [ ] Unknowns/hypotheses are explicit (not a fishing expedition).
- [ ] Boundaries are clear: what this study will *not* answer.

## B) Recruiting + participant quality checklist
- [ ] Inclusion criteria are behavior/situation-based (not demographic proxies).
- [ ] Exclusion criteria prevent low-signal interviews (no recency, no real workflow).
- [ ] Sampling plan includes 1–2 edge cases (power user, skeptic, failed adopter) with rationale.
- [ ] Recruiting plan anticipates drop-off (enough outreach volume).
- [ ] Screener screens for the story you need (recency, context, alternatives).

## C) Interview guide quality checklist
- [ ] Questions are story-first (“last time…”, “walk me through…”).
- [ ] Minimal leading language; hypotheses are not “sold” to the participant.
- [ ] Probes exist for triggers, constraints, workarounds, and outcomes.
- [ ] Time boxes are realistic; guide fits within session length.
- [ ] Consent/recording script is included and respectful.

## D) Execution + note quality checklist
- [ ] Notes separate verbatim quotes from interpretation.
- [ ] Each session captures 2–5 story moments (trigger → struggle → workaround → outcome).
- [ ] Debrief happens immediately after each interview.
- [ ] PM/design observe live or listen to recordings when possible (avoid secondhand summaries).

## E) Synthesis checklist
- [ ] Themes are tied to outcomes/constraints (not feature wishlists).
- [ ] Major insights have evidence (n, quotes) and a stated confidence level.
- [ ] Contradictions are surfaced and segmented (“true for X, not for Y”).
- [ ] Opportunities are phrased as user outcomes enabled.
- [ ] Recommendations include next validation steps (how to reduce uncertainty).

## F) Ethics + privacy checklist (baseline)
- [ ] Recording is only done with explicit permission.
- [ ] Sensitive personal data is not collected unless necessary; if collected, it’s minimized.
- [ ] Data storage/retention follows company policy (or is explicitly marked as unknown).
- [ ] Participants can skip questions and stop at any time.
