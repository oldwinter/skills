# Checklists (Usability Testing)

Use these checklists before finalizing your **Usability Test Pack**.

## A) Decision + scope checklist
- [ ] A specific decision is named and time-bounded.
- [ ] What’s in-scope (flow/feature) and out-of-scope is explicit.
- [ ] Research questions are 3–5 and map to the decision.
- [ ] The chosen method is appropriate (and alternatives are acknowledged if needed).

## B) Stimulus + task quality checklist
- [ ] Stimulus choice is explicit (live/prototype/fake door/Wizard of Oz) and justified.
- [ ] Tasks are realistic, neutral, and avoid UI labels (“Click X”).
- [ ] Each task has a starting state and a success definition.
- [ ] Task set is small enough for the session timebox (or split into sessions).
- [ ] At least one task probes micro-friction (wording, CTAs, comprehension).

## C) Participant + recruiting checklist
- [ ] Inclusion/exclusion criteria are behavior/context-based.
- [ ] Sample includes 1–2 deliberate edge cases (skeptics, power users, failed adopters) when relevant.
- [ ] Recruiting channels and outreach plan are realistic.
- [ ] Schedule includes buffers + backups for no-shows.

## D) Session operations checklist
- [ ] Moderator guide includes neutrality language (“testing the product, not you”).
- [ ] Consent/recording plan is included and matches policy.
- [ ] Note-taking roles are assigned (moderator vs note-taker) where possible.
- [ ] Tooling/logistics are ready (links, accounts, sample data, screen share).

## E) Evidence + synthesis checklist
- [ ] Notes separate verbatim from interpretation.
- [ ] Every key finding has evidence attached (quote/screenshot/time/step).
- [ ] Issue log includes severity + frequency + expected impact (directional).
- [ ] Recommendations are prioritized (quick wins vs structural fixes).
- [ ] Results translate into actions (design changes, backlog, follow-up test/experiment).

## F) Ethics + privacy checklist (baseline)
- [ ] No unnecessary personal/sensitive data is collected.
- [ ] Participants understand recording and data use (or recording is disabled).
- [ ] Data storage/retention expectations are known or explicitly marked unknown.
- [ ] Any risks requiring review (legal, medical, minors) are escalated and blocked on approval.
