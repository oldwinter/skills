3) **Taste is developable through exposure hours** (Guillermo Rauch)  
Mapped to: **Benchmark set** + **2–4 week practice plan** (workflow steps 3 and 8; [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) guidance).

4) **Build product sense via observation + curiosity + self-observation** (Julie Zhuo)  
Mapped to: **moment-based critique notes** + validate with qual/quant checks (workflow steps 4 and 7).

5) **No replacement for being a voracious user of products** (Kayvon Beykpour)  
Mapped to: **structured study sessions** + consistent critique template (workflow step 4).

## What was added in the conversion
- Explicit **input/output contracts** (minimum inputs, deliverables).
- A concrete 8-step workflow with **Inputs → Actions → Outputs → Checks**.
- Templates, checklists, and rubric to make the skill **testable** and repeatable.
