# Examples

## Example 1 — Sales enablement battlecard (B2B)
**Prompt:** “Use `competitive-analysis`. Product: SOC2 automation for startups. ICP: CTOs at 50–500 employee SaaS. Decision: reduce losses to Vanta. Known alternatives: Vanta, Drata, in-house spreadsheets, consultants. Output: Competitive Analysis Pack + battlecard for Vanta.”

**What “good” looks like:**
- Alternatives map includes status quo + consultants (not only Vanta/Drata)
- Comparison matrix uses customer criteria (implementation time, trust, audit readiness)
- Battlecard has talk tracks, landmines, objections, and evidence links

## Example 2 — Repositioning options (consumer)
**Prompt:** “Use `competitive-analysis`. Product: meditation app. ICP: stressed remote workers. Decision: reposition to ‘sleep-first’. Known alternatives: Headspace, Calm, YouTube, melatonin, doing nothing. Output: 2 positioning hypotheses.”

**What “good” looks like:**
- Alternatives include analog/non-consumption (melatonin, doing nothing)
- Two hypotheses are explicit “against” statements with proof points and tradeoffs

## Boundary example — Too broad
**Prompt:** “List every competitor in project management software.”

**Good response:**
- Ask for ICP + use case + geo + price band and propose a focused top-10 set
- Provide a monitoring plan for the rest instead of an exhaustive directory
