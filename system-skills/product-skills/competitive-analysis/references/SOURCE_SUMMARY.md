# Source summary

## Source
- `sources/refound/raw/competitive-analysis/SKILL.md`

Note: The Refound skill references `references/guest-insights.md` for deeper quotes from 49 guests; that file was not present in the provided source folder. This skill pack preserves and operationalizes the “Top Insights” present in the source SKILL.md and adds executable structure (contracts, workflow, templates, checklists).

## Preserved insights → rules/checks

### 1) Start with “competitive alternatives” (not just direct competitors)
- **Rule:** Every analysis must include a competitive alternatives map (status quo, workarounds, analog, direct/indirect).
- **Check:** Does the pack identify what the customer would do if your product didn’t exist?

### 2) Durable advantage requires understanding industry economics (not surface features)
- **Rule:** If the decision is strategic (category entry/defensibility), include an “economics/power” lens or explicitly defer it.
- **Check:** Are claims about defensibility separated from feature comparisons and grounded in economic relationships?

### 3) Speak from the customer/market/competitor perspective
- **Rule:** Decision criteria and “why they win” must be written from the customer POV, not internal politics.
- **Check:** Are criteria expressed as customer outcomes/risks and supported by evidence?

### 4) Include analog/non-consumption alternatives
- **Rule:** Include at least one analog/traditional or non-consumption alternative when relevant.
- **Check:** Does the alternatives map include “do nothing” or traditional approaches?

### 5) Competition includes workarounds and existing habits
- **Rule:** Treat workarounds/habits as first-class competitors, especially early in categories.
- **Check:** Are workarounds listed and compared on decision criteria?
