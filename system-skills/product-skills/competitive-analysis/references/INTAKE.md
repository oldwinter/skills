# Intake (Competitive Analysis)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What’s the product and target customer segment (ICP)?** Who is the buyer/user?
2) **What decision should this analysis support?** (positioning, sales enablement, roadmap bets, pricing, market entry, board update) By when?
3) **What is the core use case / job-to-be-done?** What outcome does the customer want?
4) **What are the current “alternatives” you see in deals?** Named competitors, status quo, internal build, agencies, manual workflows.
5) **What constraints matter?** Geography, compliance/regulation, deployment model, price band, integrations/ecosystem, time-to-value.

## Evidence + access (as needed)
- What evidence do you have? (win/loss notes, call transcripts, customer quotes, support tickets, reviews, pricing pages, decks)
- What level of confidence do you need? (high-confidence top 5 vs broad scan)
- Any “must-include” competitors or “must-exclude” categories?

## Output preferences (optional)
- Should battlecards be oriented for **sales**, **CS**, **PM**, or **exec** audiences?
- Preferred format: one combined pack vs separate battlecard docs
- Any terminology that must be used (category names, segments, tiers)?

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A clearly stated ICP + use-case assumption
- A competitive alternatives map that includes workarounds/analog/status quo
- A focused top-5 landscape with confidence labeling
- 2 positioning hypotheses with explicit tradeoffs
- A monitoring plan that will surface the “real competitors” over time
