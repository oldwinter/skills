# Product-Led Sales — Workflow Notes

This file expands `../SKILL.md` with practical guidance, defaults, and implementation notes.

## Workflow at a glance (7 steps)
1) Intake + readiness gate
2) PLS funnel + intervention points
3) PQL vs PQA definition
4) Signal spec + scoring + routing/SLA
5) Workflow + feedback loop
6) Usage-triggered outreach kit
7) Pilot + measurement + scale

## Default assumptions (use only if missing)
- Product: **B2B SaaS** with self-serve entry (trial or freemium) and potential for larger contracts.
- Start with **one segment** (e.g., mid-market) and one primary objective (conversion OR expansion).
- A “qualified” signal is usually a **pattern**, not a single click: combine depth + breadth + recency.
- Route to humans only when you can provide a clear **next best action** and have capacity to respond.
- Personalization must be **helpful and consent-aware**: avoid surveillance language; use only approved signals.

## Guidance by step

### 1) Readiness gate
- If you can’t define activation/aha moments or can’t map users → accounts, PLS will be noisy.
- If sales capacity is near zero, prioritize product-led conversion improvements first.
- Write a short prerequisites list (what must exist before scaling PLS).

### 2) Intervention points (keep PLG intact)
Common intervention points:
- **High intent in trial:** admin setup + integration + multi-user invites within 24–72h
- **Expansion intent:** seat growth, new team created, SSO request, billing-page activity
- **Risk/blocked intent:** repeated failures/errors; “how do I” support patterns (route to CS)

Guardrail examples:
- Don’t contact very small accounts unless intent is high.
- Don’t interrupt a user who already converted self-serve unless the goal is expansion.

### 3) PQL vs PQA
- PQL is best when one user can buy (or strongly influence) and the product is mostly single-player.
- PQA is best when adoption is team-based and value correlates with coordination (invites, admins, integrations).
- You can run both, but start with one to avoid operational chaos.

### 4) Signal spec and scoring
Signal types to combine:
- **Activation/aha:** key workflow completion
- **Depth:** frequency, time-in-product, repeated success
- **Breadth:** invites, seat growth, team/org rollout
- **Fit:** firmographic match to ICP (size, industry, tech stack)
- **Intent:** billing page, pricing, security/SSO requests, integration activation

Anti-patterns:
- One-off events without context (e.g., “visited pricing page” alone)
- Scoring that ignores sales capacity (creating more alerts than reps can handle)

### 5) Workflow and feedback loop
Minimum viable workflow:
- Alert → assignment → first touch → disposition → next action.
- Weekly 30-minute review between Product/RevOps/Sales: tune thresholds, drop bad signals, add new ones.

Recommended dispositions:
- Contacted, meeting set, converted, disqualified (bad fit), no response, nurture, routed to CS.

### 6) Outreach kit
Principles:
- Be explicit about the value you can help unlock (“happy to help you set up X”) not what you observed.
- Offer a low-friction next step: 10-minute setup call, office hours, template, or quick audit.
- Don’t over-personalize. Keep it plausible and respectful.

### 7) Pilot and scale
Pilot design suggestions:
- Pick a segment with enough volume for signal learning (but not your entire funnel).
- Define leading indicators (time-to-first-touch, meeting rate) and lagging (paid conversion, expansion).
- Add guardrails (no drop in retention/NPS; no spam complaints; reps not overwhelmed).
- Set scale criteria and a rollback plan (if false positives spike, tighten thresholds).
