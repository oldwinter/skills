# Product-Led Sales — Quality Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing the Product-Led Sales Motion Pack.

## A) Scope + readiness
- [ ] Objective is explicit (conversion vs expansion vs ACV lift) and tied to a target segment
- [ ] Readiness gate is run (activation definition exists; enough usage volume; user→account mapping plan)
- [ ] Boundaries are clear (what PLS will not do; what to do first if prerequisites missing)
- [ ] Low-touch PLG path remains intact (guardrails documented)

## B) Funnel + ownership map
- [ ] Funnel stages are defined with entry/exit criteria (not just labels)
- [ ] Intervention points are explicit and justified (why a human helps here)
- [ ] RACI is clear (Product vs Sales vs CS vs RevOps)
- [ ] SLAs are defined where sales is involved (and feasible given capacity)

## C) PQL/PQA definition quality
- [ ] Qualified unit (PQL vs PQA) matches buyer/user reality
- [ ] Definition includes required signals, thresholds, and exclusions
- [ ] False-positive controls are included (anti-gaming, “must-have” gates, decay window)
- [ ] Examples exist for qualified vs not-qualified

## D) Signals + routing/SLA fit
- [ ] Signals map to intent and value potential (not vanity)
- [ ] Scoring window and thresholds are explicit and testable
- [ ] Routing rules match capacity (alerts won’t overwhelm reps)
- [ ] Disposition taxonomy exists and is used to tune signals

## E) Workflow + feedback loop
- [ ] Reps receive enough context and a clear next best action
- [ ] Workflow includes: alert → assignment → first touch → disposition → next action
- [ ] Weekly tuning loop exists (Product/RevOps/Sales) with owners
- [ ] Escalation path exists if SLAs are missed or alerts are too noisy

## F) Outreach kit quality + safety
- [ ] Templates are short, helpful, and “not creepy”
- [ ] Personalization uses only approved signals (privacy/compliance respected)
- [ ] Each message has one clear ask and a low-friction next step
- [ ] No manipulative tactics, deception, or scraping are suggested

## G) Measurement + pilot readiness
- [ ] Pilot is bounded (segment, duration, sample size)
- [ ] Leading + lagging metrics are specified with baselines/targets where possible
- [ ] Guardrails exist (no spam complaints; no retention/NPS drop; rep capacity)
- [ ] Scale/rollback triggers are defined; rollout plan is actionable

## H) Completeness
- [ ] Pack ends with **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**
- [ ] Assumptions & unknowns are labeled with a short validation plan
- [ ] No requests for secrets or credentials
