**Notes on false positives / anti-gaming:**  
**Example qualified case:**  
**Example not-qualified case:**  

## 4) Signal spec + scoring model
| Signal | Type (aha/depth/breadth/fit/intent) | How measured (event + properties) | Threshold | Weight | Why it indicates value/intent | False-positive risks | Data source |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Scoring rules**
- Score window: (e.g., last 7/14/30 days)
- Minimum score to qualify:
- “Must-have” gates:
- Decay/recency rule:
- Triage rule for ambiguous signals:

## 5) Routing + workflow spec
**Where alerts go:** (Slack/email/CRM task)  
**Assignment logic:** (territory, ownership, round-robin, named accounts)  
**SLA:** (time-to-first-touch)  
**Required rep context:** (what the rep sees)  
**Required actions:** (touch, log, set next step)  
**Disposition taxonomy:** (contacted, meeting set, converted, nurture, disqualified, etc.)  
**Feedback loop cadence:** (weekly review)  
**Escalations:** (if SLA missed; if rep overload)  

## 6) Usage-triggered outreach kit

### Email template — high intent (trial)
**Subject options:**
- Quick help getting to `<outcome>`  
- Want a hand with `<setup step>`?

**Email (short):**
Hi `<name>` — happy to help you get to `<outcome>` in `<product>`.  
If you’re trying to `<job to be done>`, I can share a quick setup checklist and hop on a 10-minute call.  
Would `<two time options>` work?

### Email template — expansion (active account)
**Subject options:**
- Scaling `<outcome>` across your team  
- Make `<workflow>` easier for more users

**Email (short):**
Hi `<name>` — teams often hit a point where `<common friction>` when adoption grows.  
If helpful, I can walk you through options for `<admin/integration/rollout>` and what typically unlocks larger rollouts.  
Open to a quick call this week?

### Call opener + discovery prompts (usage-aware, not creepy)
**Opener:**  
“Curious what you’re trying to accomplish with `<product>` and where it’s working vs getting stuck. If there’s a faster path, I can help.”

**Prompts:**
- “What outcome are you trying to get to in the next 2–4 weeks?”
- “Who else needs to be involved for this to stick?”
- “What’s the cost of doing nothing / staying on the current approach?”
- “If we could help you `<unlock value>`, what would be a good next step?”

## 7) Pilot + scale plan
**Pilot segment:**  
**Duration:**  
**Sample size estimate:**  
**Inclusion criteria:**  
**Routing/SLA during pilot:**  
**Success metrics (lagging):**  
**Leading indicators:**  
**Guardrails:** (rep capacity, complaints, retention)  
**Review cadence:** (weekly)  
**Scale trigger:**  
**Rollback trigger:**  
**Next iteration backlog:**
