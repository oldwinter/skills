# Examples (Product Operations)

## Example A — Minimal viable Product Ops (30 days)
**Context:** 8 PMs, rapid shipping, stakeholders complain about “no visibility” and surprise launches.  
**Outputs:** Charter + 3 rituals (weekly update, biweekly roadmap review, post-launch capture) + a launch enablement bundle template.  
**Success metrics:** fewer ad-hoc status pings; Support reports fewer surprises.

## Example B — Insights pipeline for CS feedback
**Context:** CS sends weekly anecdotal feedback; PMs don’t trust it and nothing changes.  
**Outputs:** taxonomy + triage process + “insights digest” routed into a monthly insights review with clear owners.  
**Success metrics:** % of insights with an owner + decision; reduced repeated tickets on top issues.

## Boundary example — Product Ops asked to own prioritization
**Request:** “Can Product Ops decide what we build next and own the roadmap?”  
**Response:** Product Ops can standardize the decision process and artifacts, but PM/leadership keeps decision rights; use `prioritizing-roadmap` to make the prioritization decision.
