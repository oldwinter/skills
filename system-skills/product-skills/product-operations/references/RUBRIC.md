# Rubric (Product Operations)

Score each dimension **1–5**. A “ship-ready” pack is typically **≥ 20/25** with no dimension below 3.

## 1) Clarity of charter + boundaries
1 = Vague “we help” statement, unclear ownership  
3 = Clear scope/non-goals, explicit engagement model  
5 = Crisp contract, preserves PM decision rights, measurable success

## 2) Practical operating model
1 = No RACI; unclear interfaces  
3 = RACI exists; owners and escalation defined  
5 = Interfaces reduce friction; prioritization and intake are workable

## 3) Cadence + artifacts produce decisions
1 = Meetings without outputs; templates missing  
3 = Rituals produce outputs; templates exist for core artifacts  
5 = Minimal set, high leverage, easy to sustain

## 4) Insights pipeline drives action
1 = Collecting feedback with no routing  
3 = Intake/triage/routing defined; owners assigned  
5 = Clear “decision path” and reporting cadence; signal quality improves over time

## 5) Implementation + adoption
1 = No rollout plan; unrealistic scope  
3 = 30/60/90 with pilot and metrics  
5 = Adoption plan is credible; iteration loop and change comms are explicit
