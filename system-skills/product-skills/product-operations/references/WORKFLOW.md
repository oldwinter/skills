# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance and decision heuristics.

## Step 1 — Frame Product Ops as “systems for the product team”
Product Operations is most valuable when it creates **repeatable systems** that reduce coordination overhead and improve decision quality.

Avoid a grab-bag charter (“we do whatever is needed”). Start from the *top frictions* and define outcomes.

## Step 2 — Charter + boundaries (protect PM decision rights)
A good charter:
- States **what Product Ops owns** (systems, templates, cadences, enablement)
- States **what Product Ops does not own** (product strategy, priority decisions, PM/GM accountability)
- Defines an engagement model (intake, SLAs, how work is prioritized)

Heuristic: if stakeholders expect Product Ops to be “the PM for everything,” the charter is too broad.

## Step 3 — Choose an operating model: centralized, embedded, or hybrid
Common models:
- **Centralized:** one team owns systems and company-wide cadence (good for consistency).
- **Embedded:** Product Ops partners sit with product pods/areas (good for proximity and speed).
- **Hybrid:** central standards + embedded partners for high-impact areas.

Heuristics:
- If launches and comms are failing across many areas → start centralized.
- If one product area is uniquely chaotic → pilot embedded there.

## Step 4 — Make rituals produce artifacts (meetings are outputs, not time)
Treat every recurring meeting as a factory that produces an artifact:
- A decision log entry
- A roadmap/OKR update
- A release readiness decision
- An insights digest with actions

If a ritual can’t name its output, it’s a candidate to remove.

## Step 5 — Standardize outputs, not creativity
Standardization should:
- Reduce ambiguity for stakeholders
- Increase reuse across teams
- Keep PMs focused on product outcomes

Over-standardization smells like:
- Too many templates
- Too many approval gates
- “Compliance theater” with no decision impact

## Step 6 — Insights pipeline: routing beats collecting
The failure mode is collecting feedback with no place for it to go.

Define:
- Intake channels (CS, Sales, Support, product analytics, research)
- A lightweight taxonomy
- A triage cadence and owners
- A routing map: which forum turns signal into decisions

## Step 7 — Release enablement: proportionate to risk
Tier releases (low/medium/high risk) and scale the process accordingly.

Minimum viable:
- What changed + who’s impacted
- How to use it / FAQs
- Support macros + sales talk track
- Monitoring/roll-back triggers

## Step 8 — Implementation: pilot, measure, iterate
Product Ops is adoption-driven.

Start with a pilot:
- 1 product area or 1 release stream
- 2–4 cycles of the new cadence
- Collect feedback and adjust templates/cadence

Pick 1–3 measurable outcomes:
- Fewer surprise launches (support/sales)
- Reduced “status request” volume
- Faster planning cycle time
- Higher stakeholder clarity/satisfaction
