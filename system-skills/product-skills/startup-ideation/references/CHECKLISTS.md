# Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing the Startup Ideation Pack.

## A) Opportunity thesis checklist (per idea)
- Customer (ICP) is specific enough to recruit
- Job is clear (what they’re trying to accomplish)
- Pain/stakes are explicit (time/money/risk)
- Why now is concrete (named shift, not hype)
- Wedge is stated (insight/data/distribution/workflow depth)
- First test is feasible in 48h–2w and has a pass/fail signal
- Tarpit risk is acknowledged (if relevant)

## B) Why Now checklist
- Names the enabling shift(s) (capability/cost/behavior/distribution/regulatory/infra)
- Explains “why not 3 years ago?” in one sentence
- Links the shift to a concrete user behavior or workflow change
- Avoids generic statements (“AI is big”, “remote work exists”)

## C) Off-the-beaten-path checklist
- At least 5 ideas are rooted in lived experience or direct operator signals
- Signals include specific details (who/where/when)
- Information diet includes primary sources (operator conversations) not just internet reading

## D) Tarpit checklist
- Flags structural hard problems (cold start, CAC, incumbent, willingness to pay)
- For each flagged idea, either:
  - proposes a credible wedge, or
  - parks/discards the idea
- Does not ignore “distribution” (how you get customers) as a first-class constraint

## E) Scorecard checklist
- Scores cite evidence or clearly labeled assumptions
- Weights reflect the team’s constraints (e.g., if no sales capacity, penalize enterprise)
- Includes sensitivity note: what single criterion would flip the decision?

## F) Top idea brief checklist
- One-liner is crisp and includes Why Now + wedge
- ICP, user, and buyer are defined (even if hypothesized)
- Risks + assumptions are ranked and testable
- GTM motion is plausible for the team

## G) Validation plan checklist
- Tests focus on the highest-risk assumptions first
- Each test has a pass/fail signal + stop/pivot rule
- Includes at least one “non-building” test (interviews, landing page, concierge, etc.)

## H) Final pack checklist (required)
- Includes all deliverables listed in `../SKILL.md`
- Includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**
- Clear recommendation: validate vs park vs discard (and why)
