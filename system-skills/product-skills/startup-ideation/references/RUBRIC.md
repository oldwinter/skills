# Scoring rubric (0–2 per criterion)

Use this rubric to score shortlisted ideas. Adapt weights to your constraints.

Scale:
- **0** = weak / missing
- **1** = plausible but unproven
- **2** = strong with evidence or clear advantage

## Criteria definitions

### 1) Off-the-beaten-path insight
- 0: Generic idea; no unique signal or lived experience
- 1: Some signal (anecdote) but not clearly differentiated
- 2: Strong unique insight/access (repeated workflow exposure, niche community, proprietary access)

### 2) Why Now strength
- 0: No Why Now; could be done anytime
- 1: Some shift mentioned, but vague or not clearly enabling
- 2: Clear enabling shift with a convincing “why not earlier” explanation

### 3) Pain severity + urgency
- 0: Nice-to-have; low stakes; unclear budget owner
- 1: Real pain but sporadic or weak willingness-to-pay signals
- 2: High-stakes pain (time/money/risk) with strong urgency/willingness-to-pay indicators

### 4) Wedge clarity (why you win)
- 0: “We’ll build it better” / no wedge
- 1: Some differentiation, but easy for others to copy
- 2: Defensible wedge (workflow depth, data, distribution, regulatory, speed + insight)

### 5) Distribution/GTM advantage
- 0: “We’ll figure it out”; unclear channel
- 1: Plausible channel but no advantage
- 2: Credible channel advantage (existing network, partnerships, community access, clear sales motion)

### 6) Tarpit risk (inverse)
- 0: High tarpit risk; depends on miracles (cold start, brutal CAC, winner-take-most) with no wedge
- 1: Some structural risk, but mitigations are plausible
- 2: Low structural risk, or a clear wedge that avoids the tarpit

### 7) Feasibility (MVP in weeks)
- 0: Requires heavy R&D/integration/compliance; long path to MVP
- 1: MVP plausible but requires meaningful effort/unknowns
- 2: MVP can be built quickly with the team’s current skills/tools

### 8) Fast validation path
- 0: Hard to test without building the full product
- 1: Can test with some effort, but signals may be noisy
- 2: Can test quickly with clear pass/fail signals (interviews, concierge, pilot, landing page, etc.)

## Suggested interpretation
- Prefer ideas where the **top 2–3 criteria** align with your constraints (e.g., distribution + feasibility).
- If an idea wins only because of speculative scoring, downgrade and validate before committing.
