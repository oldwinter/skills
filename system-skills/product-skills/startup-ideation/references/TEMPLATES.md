## 1) Context snapshot

**Goal:**  
**Decision:**  
**Timeline:**  
**Constraints:** (time/budget/team/runway/regulatory)  
**Preferences:** (B2B/B2C; industries; business model)  

## 2) Unfair advantage + off-the-beaten-path signals

### Unfair advantages (if any)
- Advantage:
  - Evidence:
  - How it could create a wedge:

### Signals (5–15)
| Signal | Where it comes from | Who experiences it | What’s painful/expensive | Evidence (quote/data) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

## 3) Shift scan (“Why now?” raw material)

| Shift type | Shift | What this newly enables | Notes / examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| Capability |  |  |  |
| Cost |  |  |  |
| Behavior |  |  |  |
| Distribution |  |  |  |
| Regulatory |  |  |  |
| Infrastructure |  |  |  |

## 4) Opportunity theses table (15–30)

| ID | Customer (ICP) | Job to be done | Pain / stakes | Why now (shift) | Wedge (insight/data/distribution) | First test (48h–2w) | Tarpit risks |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## 5) Tarpit & differentiation notes (prune)

For each flagged idea:
- **Structural hard thing:** (cold start, CAC, incumbent, willingness to pay, switching, etc.)
- **Potential wedge:** (why you can win anyway)
- **Decision:** Keep / Park / Discard

## 6) Idea scorecard (top 3–5)

Score each 0–2 (0=weak, 1=some, 2=strong). Use [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md) for definitions.

| Criteria | Weight | Idea A | Idea B | Idea C | Notes / evidence |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Off-the-beaten-path insight |  |  |  |  |  |
| Why Now strength |  |  |  |  |  |
| Pain severity + urgency |  |  |  |  |  |
| Wedge clarity |  |  |  |  |  |
| Distribution/GTM advantage |  |  |  |  |  |
| Tarpit risk (inverse) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Feasibility (MVP in weeks) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Fast validation path |  |  |  |  |  |

## 7) Top idea brief (1‑pager)

### One-liner
For **[ICP]** who **[job]**, **[product]** helps **[outcome]** by **[wedge]**, enabled by **[Why now shift]**.

### ICP + buyer/user
- Primary user:
- Buyer / budget owner (if different):
- Where they “live” (tools, communities, workflow):

### Problem + stakes
- Current workflow / workaround:
- Pain:
- Stakes (time, money, risk, compliance, reputation):

### Why now
- Enabling shift(s):
- Why this wasn’t feasible/obvious earlier:

### Wedge / differentiation
- Unique insight/data/distribution:
- Why incumbents can’t (or won’t) do this quickly:

### GTM motion hypothesis
- First acquisition channel:
- Sales motion (self-serve, PLG, sales-led):
- Pricing hypothesis:

### Assumptions (ranked by risk)
| Assumption | Risk (H/M/L) | How to test | Pass/fail signal |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |
