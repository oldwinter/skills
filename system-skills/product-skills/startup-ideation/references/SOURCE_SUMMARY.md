# Source summary (Refound/Lenny → executable pack)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/startup-ideation/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill contained
The source skill was insight-heavy and brief, drawing from two product leaders:
- **Dalton Caldwell:** Seek off-the-beaten-path ideas rooted in personal experience; avoid idea “tarpits”; diversify your information diet.
- **Ryan Hoover:** Use frameworks to find new ideas from shifts (technology, consumer behavior) and articulate a strong **Why Now**.

## How those insights were translated into an execution contract

### Insight → rules + checks + artifacts

1) Off-the-beaten-path ideas (Caldwell)
- **Rule:** Prefer ideas grounded in lived experience or privileged workflow access.
- **Check:** Each idea cites a specific signal (who/where/when) and how it creates a wedge.
- **Artifacts:** Signals inventory + opportunity theses table ([TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md)).

2) Avoid tarpits (Caldwell)
- **Rule:** Flag structural-hard categories early; don’t proceed without a credible wedge.
- **Check:** For each flagged idea, document the structural hard thing + wedge or discard.
- **Artifacts:** Tarpit & differentiation notes + scorecard criteria ([CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md), [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md)).

3) Diversify information diet (Caldwell)
- **Rule:** Collect primary signals from operators and niche sources, not just generic tech discourse.
- **Check:** Information diet includes direct conversations + domain-specific sources.
- **Artifacts:** Information diet guidance in [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) + signals template.

4) Why Now via shifts (Hoover)
- **Rule:** Every opportunity thesis includes an enabling shift and a “why not earlier” explanation.
- **Check:** Why Now is concrete (capability/cost/behavior/distribution/regulatory/infra) and ties to a user workflow.
- **Artifacts:** Shift scan + Why Now section per idea ([TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md), [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md)).

## What’s new vs the source
The source skill did not include an explicit workflow, templates, or quality gates. This pack adds:
- A 5–9 step workflow (implemented as 8 steps)
- Copy/paste templates for all deliverables
- Checklists + scoring rubric
- Concrete examples and boundary handling
