Copy/paste these templates to produce a Problem Definition Pack.

## 1) Problem Definition Pack (full outline)

```md
# Problem Definition Pack — <short name>

## 1. Context snapshot
- Product:
- Target user/segment:
- Trigger signal (why now):
- Decision to make + deadline:
- Constraints (tech/legal/privacy/capacity):

## 2. Problem statement
**1-liner:** <Who> struggles to <job> in <context> because <cause>, resulting in <impact>.

**Expanded:**
- Symptoms (what we observe):
- Likely root causes (hypotheses):
- Impact (user + business):
- Why now:

## 3. JTBD (Jobs To Be Done)
**Primary job:** When <situation>, I want to <motivation>, so I can <expected outcome>.

**Sub-jobs:**
- ...

**Success criteria (user POV):**
- ...

## 4. Current alternatives
| Alternative | Who uses it | Why it works today | Gaps / pain | Switching costs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

## 5. Evidence & assumptions log
| Claim / assumption | Evidence we have | Confidence (L/M/H) | Test to validate | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

## 6. Success criteria + guardrails
**Outcome metric(s):**
- ...

**Leading indicators:**
- ...

**Guardrails (must not worsen):**
- ...

## 7. Scope boundaries
**In scope:**
- ...

**Out of scope / non-goals:**
- ...

**Dependencies:**
- ...

## 8. Prototype / learning plan
**Hardest assumptions to test (top 1–3):**
- ...

**Prototype/test approach:**
- Type: (clickable prototype / concierge / Wizard-of-Oz / scripted demo / survey)
- Audience:
- Key questions:
- Success criteria:
- Timeline:

## 9. Risks / Open questions / Next steps
**Risks:**
- ...

**Open questions:**
- ...

**Next steps (owners + dates):**
- ...
```

## 2) Problem statement variants (choose 1)

### A) Jobs-first
“When <situation>, <user> struggles to <job> because <constraint/cause>, which leads to <impact>.”

### B) Outcome-first
“<User/segment> cannot reliably achieve <desired outcome> due to <barrier>, causing <impact>.”

### C) Observation-first (for early discovery)
“We observe <symptom> for <segment> in <context>. We believe it’s caused by <hypothesis>.”

## 3) “Why now / why digital” prompt block
- Why is this urgent now? What changed?
- Why would a user switch from the current alternative?
- If an analog workflow exists, what platform-native advantage makes a digital version meaningfully better?

## 4) Assumptions log prompts
- What must be true for this to be worth doing?
- What do we believe but cannot yet prove?
- Which assumption, if wrong, would kill the initiative?

## 5) Prototype/test menu (fast learning options)
- **Clickable prototype:** test comprehension and desirability
- **Concierge:** manually deliver the value to learn quickly
- **Wizard-of-Oz:** simulate automation behind the scenes
- **Scripted demo:** validate narrative and willingness to engage
- **Usability test:** diagnose friction/root causes
