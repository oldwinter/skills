# Rubric (Score 1–5)

Score the PRD Pack. Aim for **≥ 3** on every dimension before circulating. If any dimension is **≤ 2**, revise.

## 1) Customer narrative clarity
1 = unclear user/problem; jargon-heavy  
3 = clear problem and why now; understandable to non-builders  
5 = compelling, evidence-backed narrative; easy to repeat and rally around

## 2) Scope boundaries
1 = goals/non-goals missing; scope creep likely  
3 = goals, non-goals, and exclusions are explicit  
5 = crisp boundaries + explicit tradeoffs + dependency/assumption visibility

## 3) Requirements quality
1 = vague requirements; not testable  
3 = numbered requirements with acceptance criteria and key edge cases  
5 = requirements are unambiguous, prioritized, and map to goals/metrics

## 4) Metrics + measurement readiness
1 = “success” is vague; no measurement plan  
3 = success metrics + guardrails with plausible sources/owners  
5 = strong instrumentation plan; clear leading indicators and decision rules

## 5) Rollout + risk management
1 = no rollout plan; risks not considered  
3 = rollout tiers + rollback plan + major risks listed  
5 = proactive risk mitigation, monitoring, and clear go/no-go criteria

## 6) AI quality (if applicable)
1 = no concrete prompt/eval plan; behavior untestable  
3 = prompt set and eval spec exist with thresholds and critical failures  
5 = evals are “living requirements” with strong coverage and regression policy

## 7) Document craft (impact through artifacts)
1 = hard to read; inconsistent terms; missing ownership/next steps  
3 = readable, structured, decision-ready  
5 = polished, concise, and stands alone without a meeting
