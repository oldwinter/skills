# Source summary

## Source
- `sources/refound/raw/writing-north-star-metrics/SKILL.md`

Note: The Refound skill references `references/guest-insights.md`, but that file was not available in the repository. This skill pack preserves the “Top Insights” that are present and adds executable structure (contracts, workflow, templates, checklists).

## Preserved insights → rules/checks

### 1) Don’t operate on a purely lagging goal (e.g., retention) without controllable inputs
- **Rule:** Avoid using a lagging outcome as the only operating target; define leading input/proxy metrics that teams can move this quarter.
- **Check:** Does the driver tree include input metrics with realistic levers and a clear link to the outcome?

### 2) A clear North Star simplifies decisions in complex ecosystems
- **Rule:** The North Star Narrative must function as a tie-breaker across teams and surfaces.
- **Check:** Can a stakeholder use the narrative to decide between two roadmap options?

### 3) Measure value from the customer’s perspective (including “absence of friction”)
- **Rule:** Prefer metrics that represent delivered customer value, not internal activity; include friction-reduction candidates when relevant.
- **Check:** Would you be comfortable showing the metric to customers as “how we measure success”?

### 4) Treat the North Star as a qualitative model first, then add measurement
- **Rule:** Write the narrative/value model before selecting the number.
- **Check:** Can you describe the value moment and who it serves without referencing the metric?

### 5) Management is aligning resources to a clear outcome
- **Rule:** The pack must specify owners, cadence, and decision rules so teams can execute against the North Star.
- **Check:** Does the rollout plan say who reviews the metric, how often, and what decisions it governs?
