# Pricing Strategy — Scoring Rubric (1–5)

Score each category from **1 (weak)** to **5 (excellent)**. A “ship-ready” pack is typically **4+** across categories, with no critical 1–2s.

## 1) Decision clarity
**1:** Unclear decision/timeline; ambiguous audience; missing constraints.  
**3:** Decision and timeline are stated; some constraints captured.  
**5:** Decision, timeline, audience, and constraints are crisp; success criteria are explicit.

## 2) Segment + value narrative quality
**1:** Segment is vague; buyer/user unclear; value described as features.  
**3:** Segments identified; value mostly outcome-based.  
**5:** Clear segment map (buyer vs user) with outcome/risk framing and exclusion criteria.

## 3) Pricing architecture coherence (value metric + packaging)
**1:** Plans/metric feel arbitrary; unclear upgrade path.  
**3:** Reasonable metric and plan structure; some edge cases.  
**5:** Metric and packaging align to value; clear upgrade drivers; self-serve vs sales-led boundary is explicit.

## 4) Evidence + WTP plan quality
**1:** No evidence plan; price choices are vibes.  
**3:** Basic evidence plan; some interview prompts; gaps acknowledged.  
**5:** Strong triangulation plan (qual + quant + context), explicit hypotheses, and clear next learning steps.

## 5) Conversion mechanics + experimentation
**1:** Trial/sampling plan is generic or risky; no guardrails.  
**3:** Plausible mechanics and an experiment list; partial metrics.  
**5:** Premium value is demonstrated in-product; experiments are prioritized with metrics, guardrails, and abuse controls.

## 6) Rollout + operational feasibility
**1:** No migration/rollback plan; ignores billing/sales/support realities.  
**3:** Rollout steps exist; some operational considerations.  
**5:** Clear phased rollout, migration rules, comms plan, enablement, and rollback criteria/playbook.

## 7) Risk management + completeness
**1:** Risks/unknowns are missing; no next steps.  
**3:** Risks/questions/next steps included but thin.  
**5:** Risks are concrete with mitigations; open questions are prioritized; next steps are actionable and time-boxed.
