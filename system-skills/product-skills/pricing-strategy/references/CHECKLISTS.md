# Pricing Strategy — Quality Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing the Pricing Strategy Pack.

## A) Scope + decision quality
- The decision to support is explicit (new pricing, repricing, packaging, trial, discount policy).
- The target segment(s) and buying context (buyer vs user) are explicit.
- Constraints are captured (billing, contracts, compliance, brand).
- The blast radius is described (existing customers, migrations, support/sales readiness).

## B) Value metric and “price = value” coherence
- Price is treated as a **measure of value**: each price point has a value rationale.
- A primary value metric is selected (with 1–2 alternates) and tied to customer outcomes.
- Each plan has a clear “who it’s for” and a coherent upgrade path.
- Hypotheses are stated clearly (what changes, for whom, and why).

## C) Evidence + willingness-to-pay (WTP) plan
- There is a concrete WTP plan (who to talk to, what to ask, what decision it informs).
- Evidence sources are listed (metrics, quotes, win/loss, public competitor context).
- Unknowns are labeled and a validation plan is included (not hidden).

## D) Self-serve vs sales-led boundary
- The pack defines when self-serve stops working (payment limits, procurement, compliance, security, contract size).
- Sales assist triggers are explicit and operationally feasible.
- Enterprise needs (SSO, invoicing, security review) are accounted for without over-building.

## E) Conversion mechanics (sampling + friction reduction)
- Premium value is visible before purchase (sampling/reverse trial/capped trial).
- Monetary friction is reduced intentionally (trial design, early discounts) with guardrails.
- Success metrics include long-term outcomes (retention/expansion/LTV), not only short-term conversion.
- Abuse controls and eligibility rules are defined (to avoid revenue leakage).

## F) Rollout + measurement
- The rollout plan includes migration rules, comms, and support/sales enablement.
- KPIs and guardrails are defined (e.g., conversion, ARPA, churn, payment failures, refunds).
- Rollback criteria and a rollback playbook are included.

## G) Iteration cadence
- A review cadence is defined (default revisit every 6–12 months).
- Triggers are listed (new value shipped, segment shift, conversion drift, competitive change).

## H) Required final section
- The pack includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, and **Next steps**.
