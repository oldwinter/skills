# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → Skill Pack)

Source file: `sources/refound/raw/measuring-product-market-fit/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill emphasized
- Use the **Sean Ellis PMF survey** and focus on the “**very disappointed**” segment as a leading indicator of “must-have.”
- Treat PMF as **dynamic**: market/economic shifts can reset PMF, and user expectations rise over time.
- Use **reference customers** as a practical validation: people willing to vouch for the product are a strong signal.
- For **marketplaces pre-PMF**, focus on the **core exchange of value** and build a growth strategy for **one side first** (often the “hard side” like supply).

## How this skill pack operationalizes those insights
- Converts insights into a repeatable **PMF Measurement Pack** with explicit deliverables.
- Adds an execution workflow (7 steps) with checks and a quality gate.
- Triangulates PMF with three signal types:
  1) Sean Ellis survey (must-have)
  2) Behavioral evidence (retention/engagement)
  3) Advocacy evidence (reference customers/testimonials)
- Adds “PMF drift” handling: drift triggers + re-measurement cadence.

## Notes / limitations
- The source references a deep dive file (`references/guest-insights.md`) that was not present in the repository snapshot; this pack is derived from the visible excerpts and common PMF measurement practice.
