# Examples — Partnership & BD Execution Pack

Use these as pattern matches for what “good” looks like.

## Example 1 — Integration ecosystem (B2B SaaS)
**Context:** A B2B SaaS product wants to drive pipeline through integration partners but has limited engineering capacity.

**Strong outputs include:**
- A shortlist of 10–15 partners with decision-maker hypotheses and a warm-path plan
- Offer tiers that protect engineering (Tier 1 = light integration, Tier 2 = deep only for top-scoring partners)
- A pitch that makes the partner’s benefit explicit (e.g., more attach rate, retention, new category wedge)
- An outreach sequence that tests 2–3 message angles over 2 weeks

## Example 2 — Channel/referral program (services-adjacent)
**Context:** A product is often bundled with agencies/consultancies.

**Strong outputs include:**
- A partner profile definition (which agencies, client sizes, verticals)
- Simple referral terms + enablement assets (one pager, FAQ, intro script)
- An operating cadence (monthly training + shared pipeline review)

## Boundary example — “logo hunting”
**Prompt:** “Get us a partnership with <BigCo> because they’re big.”

**Recommended response:**
- Ask for a measurable objective and a value exchange
- Define walk-away conditions to avoid a bad exclusivity deal
- If the only rationale is brand association, recommend alternative tactics (PR, content, customer proof) first
