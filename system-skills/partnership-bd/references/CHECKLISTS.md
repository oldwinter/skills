# Checklists — Partnership & BD Execution Pack

Use this before finalizing outputs.

## A) Objective + scope checklist
- [ ] Objective is stated as outcome + metric + date (not “do partnerships”)
- [ ] Partnership type(s) are explicitly chosen (platform/integration, channel/referral, strategic/co-marketing)
- [ ] Non-goals are listed (what we’re *not* doing)
- [ ] Constraints are explicit (eng/marketing capacity, compliance, exclusivity appetite)

## B) Scalable offer checklist (avoid bespoke)
- [ ] Offer tiers are defined (what we can reliably deliver)
- [ ] “What we will NOT do” list exists
- [ ] Negotiation parameters are documented (defaults + pre-approved ranges)
- [ ] Internal owners are clear (who can approve exceptions)

## C) Partner list + scoring checklist
- [ ] Longlist exists (20–60) and shortlist exists (10–30)
- [ ] Scoring criteria + weights are explicit
- [ ] Top partners have: “why they care” + expected value + key risks
- [ ] Each top partner has a “finger-on-the-button” decision-maker hypothesis
- [ ] Each top partner has a lowest-social-capital intro path and a next action

## D) Pitch + outreach checklist
- [ ] Pitch answers: why them / why us / why now
- [ ] Value exchange is concrete (not vague “synergies”)
- [ ] Proof points are included (even if small; clearly labeled)
- [ ] Outreach templates are specific and ethical (no spam, no deception)
- [ ] 2–4 week execution plan exists with a tracking loop

## E) Deal + negotiation checklist
- [ ] Deal path is defined (discovery → pilot → terms → launch)
- [ ] Walk-away conditions are explicit
- [ ] Exclusivity logic is written (when it’s acceptable; what you get for it)
- [ ] MAP exists with owners + exit criteria
- [ ] Legal/security review is called out as a human checkpoint (as needed)

## F) Launch + ops checklist
- [ ] Launch definition is clear (what “live” means)
- [ ] Enablement assets are listed (docs, FAQ, internal training)
- [ ] Co-marketing plan is concrete (channels + dates)
- [ ] Metrics are defined (leading + lagging indicators)
- [ ] Operating cadence exists (syncs + QBR + escalation)

## G) Finalization checklist (required)
- [ ] **Risks** section included
- [ ] **Open questions** section included
- [ ] **Next steps** section included (this week’s actions)
