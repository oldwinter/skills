### Warm intro ask (to a connector)
Subject: Quick intro to <Partner>?

Hi <Name> — quick ask. We’re exploring a partnership with <Partner> because <why-them in one line>.  
Could you introduce me to <specific person/role> who owns <function>?  
If helpful, here’s a 2-sentence blurb you can forward:

> <1 sentence: what we do + for whom>  
> <1 sentence: why partner might care + low-friction ask>

Thank you — and totally fine if now isn’t the right time.

### Cold email / DM (ethical, specific)
Subject: Potential <type> partnership for <ICP outcome>

Hi <Name> — I’m <you> at <company>. We help <ICP> achieve <outcome> by <how>.  
Reaching out because <specific reason this partner should care>.

I think there’s a win-win:
- For <Partner>: <benefit>  
- For us: <benefit>

Would you be open to a 20-min call next week to see if a small pilot makes sense?

### Follow-up (value add)
Subject: Re: <previous subject>

Quick follow-up — here’s a 1-pager with the proposed value exchange and a small pilot idea: <link or attached summary>.  
If this isn’t your area, who’s the best person to speak with?

### “Alpha / case study” angle (platform partners)
Subject: Alpha partner + flagship case study?

Hi <Name> — we’re seeing <trend> in <category>. We already have <proof/experience>.  
If <Partner> is investing in <initiative>, we’d love to be an early/alpha partner and help produce a strong case study in <segment>.

If helpful, we can start with a 2-week pilot with clear success criteria.
