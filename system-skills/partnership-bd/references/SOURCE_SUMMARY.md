# Source summary — Partnership & BD

Source: `sources/refound/raw/partnership-bd/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill emphasized (preserved insights)
- **Cold outreach + content builds relationships:** proactive DMs/emails and sharing useful content can create high-value connections.
- **Scale partnerships via productization:** strong BD teams avoid one-off bespoke negotiations by working with Product to create scalable partner platforms and clear negotiation parameters.
- **Pitch platforms with a “help you win” angle:** for major ecosystems, positioning yourself as an alpha/beta customer and a strong case study can unlock preferential access.
- **Network-dependent markets need crisp asks:** in regulated or relationship-driven industries, intros are expensive—clarity reduces social-capital cost and increases conversion.
- **Patience and the willingness to say “no” improves terms:** delaying or declining can create leverage for better deals and exclusivity.

## How this skill pack operationalizes those insights
- Converts “cold outreach + content” into an **Outreach kit + execution plan** (SKILL workflow Step 5; templates in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md)).
- Converts “scale via productization” into **offer tiers + negotiation parameters** (Step 2; templates + checklist items).
- Converts “platform pitch” into a **1-page pitch with alpha/case-study variant** (Step 4; outreach templates).
- Converts “network dependence” into **decision-maker mapping + low-social-capital intro paths** (Step 3; partner list columns).
- Converts “patience/no” into **walk-away conditions + deal path + MAP** (Step 6; checklist + rubric).

## Notes / gaps
