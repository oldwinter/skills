# Workflow — Partnership & BD (Execution Pack)

Use this as a deeper, copy/paste workflow companion to `../SKILL.md`.

## Step 1 — Define the objective + pick the partnership type
**Goal:** Avoid “partnerships as vibes” by tying work to a measurable outcome.

1) Write a one-line objective:
   - “We want **X** (outcome) measured by **Y** (metric) by **Z** (date).”
2) Pick the partnership type(s) in scope:
   - **Platform/integration:** distribution via ecosystem + product surface area
   - **Channel/referral:** partners bring leads; you enable them to sell/introduce
   - **Strategic/co-marketing:** credibility + joint narrative + shared audience
3) Decide if the motion is network-dependent:
   - If intros are expensive, optimize for crispness: a tight use case + low-friction ask.

Outputs: `references/TEMPLATES.md` → Context snapshot + Partnership thesis.

## Step 2 — Define the scalable “partner package” (what’s standard vs bespoke)
**Goal:** Increase velocity and protect Product/Engineering from one-off deals.

1) Define offer tiers (example):
   - **Tier 0:** co-marketing only (no integration)
   - **Tier 1:** light integration (2–4 weeks) + listing + basic enablement
   - **Tier 2:** deep integration (8–12 weeks) + co-sell motion + joint roadmap
2) Decide negotiation parameters up front:
   - Pre-approved ranges (rev share, MDF/co-marketing commitments, exclusivity rules)
   - “We do not do” list (e.g., bespoke SLAs, custom forks, unlimited support)

Outputs: Offer tiers + Negotiation parameters sheet.

## Step 3 — Build + score the partner list (and identify decision-makers)
**Goal:** Focus time on partners where mutual value and decision velocity are real.

1) Build the longlist (20–60) from:
   - ecosystem directories, customer “stack” data, competitor partners, conferences, communities
2) Score each partner (suggested criteria):
   - Strategic fit (ICP overlap)
   - Distribution potential (reach)
   - Feasibility (integration effort; internal bandwidth)
   - Mutual value clarity (“why they care”)
   - Decision velocity (can we reach a decider?)
   - Risk (compliance, exclusivity traps, reputational risk)
3) Map decision-makers:
   - Identify the “finger-on-the-button” person and the cheapest intro path.

Outputs: Partner target list + scoring model + top wedge recommendation.

## Step 4 — Craft the value exchange + pitch (case study / alpha angle)
**Goal:** Make it obvious why partnering with you helps *them* win.

1) Write the value exchange as a table:
   - Their goal → their risk → what you offer → proof → what you’re asking for
2) For major platforms, propose:
   - alpha/beta participation, a flagship case study, or a new category wedge they want to grow
3) Keep the ask low-friction:
   - “20 minutes to explore fit” → “2-week pilot” → “terms” → “launch”

Outputs: One-page pitch + talk track + proof points.

## Step 5 — Outreach plan (warm first, ethical cold second) + lightweight content plan
**Goal:** Create a repeatable system for relationship-building.

1) Build the outreach kit:
   - warm intro ask, cold email/DM, follow-ups, meeting ask
2) Create a 2–4 week execution plan:
   - daily/weekly targets, personalization hooks, tracking sheet
3) Add a content assist (optional):
   - 2–4 posts or a short “partner memo” that signals credibility and POV

Outputs: Outreach kit + 2–4 week execution plan.

## Step 6 — Deal path + negotiation (guardrails + patience)
**Goal:** Avoid bad deals driven by partner logos or urgency theater.

1) Define the deal path:
   - discovery → pilot/MVP → term sheet → legal/security → launch
2) Use strategic patience:
   - be willing to say “not yet” if timing/terms aren’t right
3) Document:
   - walk-away conditions, exclusivity logic, support limits, success criteria

Outputs: MAP + pilot definition + key terms outline.

## Step 7 — Launch + operate + quality gate
**Goal:** Turn “signed” into “shipping value,” then keep it alive.

1) Launch plan:
   - enablement, co-marketing, product readiness, customer comms, support plan
2) Operating cadence:
   - weekly/biweekly working sync; monthly metrics; quarterly review/QBR
3) Run:
   - [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) and [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md)

Always output: Risks / Open questions / Next steps.
