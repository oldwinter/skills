# Intake (North Star Metric)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and provide 2–3 options.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What’s the product and primary customer segment?** (B2B/B2C, personas, key segment)
2) **What’s the “value moment”?** In one sentence: “A customer gets value when ___.”
3) **What’s the business model and strategic goal for the next 6–12 months?** (growth/activation/retention/margin/trust)
4) **What horizon do you need to influence?** (this quarter vs this year) and **what levers do you control** (pricing, onboarding, recommendations, supply, etc.)
5) **What can you measure today?** (data sources, latency, gaps) + any constraints (privacy, compliance, platform, offline events)

## Helpful follow-ups (as needed)
- **Decision context:** Who must agree? What decisions should the North Star settle?
- **Current state:** What metrics do teams optimize today? Where are incentives misaligned?
- **Customer model:** Who is the customer vs user (esp. B2B)? What is the primary job-to-be-done?
- **Value frequency:** How often should a customer experience the value moment? (daily/weekly/monthly)
- **Quality / trust:** What must not degrade when optimizing? (NPS, refunds, complaints, fraud, churn, margin)
- **Segments:** Which segments matter most? Do you need separate North Stars by segment or one metric with slices?
- **Ecosystem effects:** If you optimize this metric, who/what could get worse?

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A **Context snapshot** stating assumptions
- 3–5 **candidate metrics** spanning different philosophies (value delivery, friction reduction, monetization-adjacent)
- A clear list of **open questions** that would change the choice
