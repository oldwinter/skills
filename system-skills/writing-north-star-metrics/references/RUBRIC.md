# Rubric (Score the Pack)

Score each category **0–2** and sum. Use the notes to decide what to fix.

Scale:
- **0 = Missing / unacceptable**
- **1 = Partial / unclear**
- **2 = Strong / clear / decision-ready**

## Scoring table

| Category | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Customer value (POV) | | | |
| Clarity & simplicity | | | |
| Measurability (unambiguous spec) | | | |
| Controllability (within horizon) | | | |
| Leading inputs/proxies defined | | | |
| Guardrails & ecosystem impact | | | |
| Cross-functional usefulness (tie-breaker) | | | |
| Operationalization (owners/cadence) | | | |
| Risks/open questions/next steps quality | | | |

## Interpretation
- **16–18:** Strong. Ready to share and operationalize.
- **12–15:** Usable but has gaps; fix the lowest-scoring categories.
- **<12:** Not decision-ready; revisit narrative, definition clarity, and controllable inputs.
