# Source summary (what was preserved)

Original source: `sources/refound/raw/platform-infrastructure/SKILL.md`

This skill pack converts the original “Platform & Infrastructure” insights into an execution contract that produces a concrete **Platform & Infrastructure Improvement Pack**.

## Preserved insights → rules/artifacts

1) **Abstract common capabilities into shared infrastructure (feature velocity).**  
Rule: Identify repeated feature components and turn them into shared primitives with explicit contracts and migration plans.  
Artifacts: “Shared capabilities inventory + platformization plan”.

2) **Infrastructure success is often invisible (reliability, performance, privacy, safety).**  
Rule: Make quality attributes explicit and measurable; include privacy/safety requirements, not just feature work.  
Artifacts: “Quality attributes spec” with proposed SLOs/SLIs.

3) **Discoverability for large web platforms depends on crawlable structure.**  
Rule: If SEO matters, define sitemap + internal-linking requirements so bots can discover content.  
Artifacts: “Discoverability plan (optional)”.

4) **Avoid premature optimization, but plan ahead for scaling ‘doomsday’ scenarios.**  
Rule: Track leading indicators and define lead-time-aware triggers to start scaling projects before crisis.  
Artifacts: “Scaling doomsday clock + capacity plan”.

5) **Server-side analytics is more reliable than client SDKs.**  
Rule: Prefer server-side event capture for canonical behaviors; define an event contract and data-quality checks.  
Artifacts: “Instrumentation plan” including server-side analytics event contract.

## Notes
- The source frontmatter mentions “6 insights”, but the provided source file contains 5 leaders/insights. This pack covers the 5 present insights.
