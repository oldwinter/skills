# Checklists

Use these as a final gate before publishing the write-up.

## 1) Prep checklist (before the session)
- Review type is clear (incident vs project vs OKR).
- Facilitator, scribe, and decision owner are assigned.
- Attendees are the people with the best evidence (not just hierarchy).
- Pre-reads/evidence links are collected (dashboards, tickets, docs).
- The stated goal is learning + improvement (not blame).
- Privacy constraints are handled (no names/PII if not appropriate).

## 2) Facilitation checklist (during the session)
- Start with blameless ground rules and enforce them.
- Spend time on **facts + timeline** before discussing “why”.
- Separate **facts** from **hypotheses** explicitly.
- Use a systems lens (conditions, incentives, gaps) rather than individual blame.
- Ask the learning question explicitly: “What did we learn?”
- Keep the meeting decision-oriented: actions, owners, dates.

## 3) Output quality checklist (the document)
- Includes: brief + agenda, impact snapshot, timeline, contributing factors, decisions, action tracker.
- Top contributing factors map to top action items (no mismatch).
- Action items have owner + due date + success signal + follow-up date.
- If kill criteria/triggers are included, each has a **committed action** (not “we’ll discuss”).
- Language is blameless and system-focused (no “X messed up”).
- The doc includes a 1-page shareout and where it will be published.
- Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.

## 4) Follow-through checklist (after publication)
- Action items are tracked in the team’s system of record (ticket/board/doc).
- The decision owner schedules (or hooks into) a follow-up review date/cadence.
- The shareout is delivered to the intended audience.
- “Repeat failures” are flagged and addressed as systemic debt (not normalized).
