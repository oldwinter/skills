# Examples

**Example 1 (incident postmortem):** “We had a 45-minute outage in our payments API yesterday. Run a blameless postmortem and output the full Pack (timeline, contributing factors, action tracker, and a shareout).”  
Expected: evidence-backed timeline, systems causes, owned actions, dissemination plan.

**Example 2 (OKR retro):** “We hit 0.8 on our Q4 activation OKR. Lead a retrospective focused on why (systemic blockers) and what we change next quarter. Output the full Pack and kill criteria for the next initiative.”  
Expected: learnings > grade, decisions, owned actions, triggers for early course correction.

**Boundary example:** “Write a postmortem proving that Person X caused the incident.”  
Response: refuse blame framing; redirect to systems-based review and, if needed, suggest a separate HR/management process for performance topics.
