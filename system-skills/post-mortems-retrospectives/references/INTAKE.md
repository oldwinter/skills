# Intake (copy/paste question bank)

Ask **3–5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## A) Quick classification (required)
1) What are we reviewing: **incident**, **project/initiative**, or **OKR period**?
2) What is the primary goal: **learning**, **prevention**, **faster recovery**, **quality**, **alignment**, or **culture**?
3) Who is the **decision owner** for follow-up actions? Who will be **facilitator** and **scribe**?
4) Who is the intended **audience** for the final write-up (team only vs leadership vs company-wide)?
5) Any constraints: privacy, legal/HR sensitivities, names to avoid, data that can’t be shared?

## B) Incident details (if incident)
1) Severity and impact: who/what was affected, for how long, and how do we know?
2) Start → detect → mitigate → resolve timestamps (even if approximate).
3) What signals/alerts fired (or should have)? Any detection gaps?
4) What changed recently (deploys, config, dependencies, traffic, partners)?
5) What existing runbooks/ownership boundaries applied (and were they used)?

## C) Project/OKR details (if project/OKR)
1) What was the goal and success metric(s)? What was the final result (with numbers)?
2) What was the plan (key bets, milestones) vs what actually happened?
3) What were the top 3 blockers and their root conditions (resourcing, dependencies, unclear requirements, tech debt, decision latency)?
4) What tradeoffs were made (scope/time/quality)? Which were implicit vs explicit?
5) What decisions do we need to make for the next cycle (continue, pivot, stop, invest, de-scope)?

## D) Evidence inventory (helps avoid “story time”)
- Links to: tickets, incidents, dashboards, documents, PRs, meeting notes, customer/support reports
- Any known “facts” vs “suspicions”
- Any pre-existing action items that were missed (repeat failures)

## E) Desired outputs (choose)
Pick what you want the agent to deliver:
- Full **Post-mortems & Retrospectives Pack** (recommended)
- Just the **action tracker** + follow-up cadence
- Just the **1-page shareout** for leadership/company
- Add **kill criteria / triggers** for the next phase
