# Intake (OKRs & Goals)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and provide 2–3 OKR set options (conservative/base/ambitious).

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What’s the planning cycle and horizon?** (quarter/year; start/end dates)
2) **What team(s) are in scope and what do they own?** (Activation, Growth, Core, Platform, etc.)
3) **What is the company goal / North Star for this cycle?** One sentence. If none, what strategy memo/exec priority should we anchor to?
4) **What baselines do we have today?** For the likely outcome metrics + data source/latency.
5) **What constraints exist?** (capacity, must-do commitments, dependencies, deadlines, risk tolerance)

## Helpful follow-ups (as needed)
- **Decision-making:** Who is the decider? Who needs to align (Eng/Design/Data/Marketing/Sales/CS)?
- **Focus areas:** What are the top 2–4 problems/opportunities we must change in this cycle?
- **Non-goals:** What are we explicitly *not* doing this cycle?
- **Metric pitfalls:** Any metrics that have been gamed or created perverse incentives in the past?
- **Guardrails:** What must not get worse? (quality, trust, churn, margin, support volume, employee load)
- **Review cadence:** Weekly or biweekly check-ins? Who attends? What decisions are allowed mid-cycle?
- **Ambition level:** Should we include a “10x” objective to force a rethink, or keep it incremental?

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A **Context snapshot** stating assumptions
- 2–3 OKR set options (conservative/base/ambitious)
- A short **open questions** list describing what would change the OKRs materially
