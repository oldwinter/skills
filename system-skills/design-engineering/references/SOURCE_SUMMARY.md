# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/design-engineering/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill said (high-level)
The source skill offered two core insights:
1) **Design engineering as a function**: a hybrid of UX design and engineering that helps prototype and ship faster (example: creating the function at Snap and Captions).
2) **The hybrid skillset is valuable**: people with both design sensibility and the ability to ship production-ready code are highly successful (example: Vercel).

## How this skill pack preserves and operationalizes it
This pack converts the insights into an execution contract by providing:
- A **charter** and operating model to create/clarify the design engineering function.
- A **prototype→production workflow** so prototypes reliably graduate into shippable work.
- A **design-to-code contract** to reduce handoff ambiguity and rework.
- A **delivery plan + quality gate** to make the practice measurable and repeatable.
