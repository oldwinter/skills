# Rubric (Scoring)

Score each dimension **1–5**. A “ship-ready” pack is typically **≥ 22/30** with no dimension below **3**.

## 1) Scope clarity (1–5)
- 1: Vague; unclear what design engineering means here.
- 3: Clear definition and boundaries; some edge cases unresolved.
- 5: Crystal clear scope, boundaries, and when-not-to-use guidance.

## 2) Operating model fit (1–5)
- 1: Model not chosen or mismatched to the problem.
- 3: Model chosen and justified; interfaces mostly defined.
- 5: Model strongly matches constraints; ownership and rituals are crisp.

## 3) Prototype→production rigor (1–5)
- 1: Prototypes and production are conflated; no gates.
- 3: Ladder exists; some graduation rules/gates defined.
- 5: Clear ladder with graduation rules, throwaway/shippable labels, and review gates.

## 4) Design-to-code contract quality (1–5)
- 1: Handoff is ad-hoc; missing states/a11y expectations.
- 3: Contract covers key items; some ambiguity remains.
- 5: Contract is implementable with minimal back-and-forth; states, tokens, a11y, and PR expectations are explicit.

## 5) Delivery plan executability (1–5)
- 1: No milestones/owners; feels aspirational.
- 3: Milestones exist; acceptance criteria are partial.
- 5: Incremental milestones with owners, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and rollback/stop conditions.

## 6) Quality bar + sustainability (1–5)
- 1: Quality depends on taste; no repeatable checks.
- 3: Checklists exist; automation/docs are partial.
- 5: Repeatable quality mechanisms (review gates + docs + optional automation) and measurable success signals.
