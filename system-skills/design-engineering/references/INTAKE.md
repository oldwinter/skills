# Intake (Question Bank)

Ask up to **5** questions at a time, then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## A) Context + scope
1) What product area is in scope (web/native) and who is the primary user?
2) What is the goal: faster iteration, better craft, consistency, accessibility, fewer handoff bugs, or all of the above?
3) What’s the timeline/horizon (2 weeks / 6 weeks / quarter) and any fixed deadlines?

## B) Current state (design + code)
4) What design artifacts exist today (Figma, prototypes, design system, tokens)? How are designs handed off?
5) What is the implementation stack (React/Vue/Swift/Kotlin/etc.) and do you have Storybook/component docs?

## C) Team + operating model
6) Who is involved today (Design, Eng, PM) and where does quality sign-off happen?
7) Are you trying to (a) staff a design engineer role, (b) create a team/function, or (c) run a one-off project?

## D) Quality bar + constraints
8) Must-have requirements: accessibility level, performance targets, browser/device support, i18n, compliance.
9) Where do bugs/friction happen today (missing states, pixel gaps, rework, unclear ownership)?

## E) Output preferences
10) Do you want the pack to be a hiring/role plan, a delivery plan for a component library, or both?
