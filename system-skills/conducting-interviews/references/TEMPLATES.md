# Templates (Conducting Interviews)

Copy/paste and adapt. Keep language consistent across interviewers and candidates.

## 1) Interview Plan (single stage)

### Interview plan: `<role>` — `<stage>` (`<duration>`)

**Stage goal (one sentence):**  
`<screen for X / validate Y / sell Z / decide next step>`

**Candidate context (what they should know):**
- `<mission / product / team / what’s hard / why hire now>`

**Evaluation criteria (4–8):**
| Criterion | Definition | Strong looks like | Weak looks like |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<criterion>` | `<definition>` | `<behaviors/outcomes>` | `<anti-signals>` |

**Agenda + timeboxes**
- 0:00–0:03 — Welcome + set structure
- 0:03–0:05 — Candidate intro (optional)
- 0:05–0:40 — Criteria questions + probes
- 0:40–0:44 — Candidate questions
- 0:44–0:45 — Close + next steps

**Close questions (always include)**
- “Is there anything else you want to make sure we covered?”

## 2) Question Map (one question, one signal)

| Criterion | Primary question (behavioral) | Probes (force specifics) | What “good” sounds like | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<criterion>` | “Tell me about a time you ___.” | `<role/constraints/trade-offs/result/different next time>` | `<evidence markers>` | `<space>` |

Global questions (use as appropriate):
- “How did you prepare for this interview?”
- “Why do you want to work here?”

## 3) Interviewer Script (runbook)

### Opening (2–3 min)
“Thanks for taking the time. I’ll run us through a few questions focused on `<criteria>`, leave time for your questions, and then share next steps.”

### Questions (timeboxed)
- `<Question 1>` (criterion: `<x>`)
  - Probes: `<...>`
- `<Question 2>` (criterion: `<y>`)
  - Probes: `<...>`

### Notes reminders
- Capture specifics: decisions, constraints, metrics, artifacts, outcomes.
- If delivery is polished, ask for deeper specifics; if delivery is messy, clarify the question (don’t lead).

### Closing (2–3 min)
“What questions do you have for me?”  
“Is there anything else you want to make sure we covered today?”  
“Next steps are `<timeline + owner>`.”

## 4) Notes + Scorecard

### Candidate: `<name>` | Role: `<role>` | Stage: `<stage>` | Date: `<yyyy-mm-dd>`

**Notes (raw, chronological)**
- `<timestamp>` — `<facts, decisions, outcomes>`

**Scorecard (fill immediately after)**
| Criterion | Rating (1–5) | Evidence (2–4 bullets) | Confidence (low/med/high) |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `<criterion>` |  |  |  |

**Overall recommendation**
- Recommendation: `<strong yes / yes / leaning yes / leaning no / no / strong no>`
- Why (evidence-based, 5–8 sentences): `<...>`
- Biggest risks/unknowns: `<...>`
- Follow-ups (questions or next-stage focus): `<...>`

## 5) Debrief Summary (panel-ready)

### Debrief: `<candidate>` for `<role>`

**Evidence summary**
- Strengths (with evidence):
  - `<strength>` — `<evidence>`
- Concerns (with evidence):
  - `<concern>` — `<evidence>`

**Open questions**
- `<what is still uncertain and how to resolve it>`

**Recommendation + confidence**
- `<strong yes/yes/...>` (confidence: `<low/med/high>`)

**Suggested next step**
- `<additional interview / work sample / reference check / reject / offer>`
