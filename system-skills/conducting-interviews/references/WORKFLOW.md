# Expanded Workflow (Conducting Interviews)

Use this when you need more guidance than `SKILL.md` provides.

## Principles (what makes an interview “high-signal”)
1) **Structured beats improvised:** the same criteria and anchors across candidates increases fairness and comparability.
2) **Behavioral beats hypothetical:** past behavior + specifics is more predictive than opinions and frameworks.
3) **Evidence beats eloquence:** distinguish “polished communication” from real judgment and ownership.
4) **One question, one signal:** map each question to one primary criterion to avoid muddled scoring.
5) **Write it down, then discuss:** score from notes before panel discussions to reduce groupthink.

## Suggested workflow (7 steps)

### Step 1 — Define the stage goal and constraints
- Decide what this stage is responsible for (and what it is not).
- Timebox explicitly (e.g., 45 minutes total with 5 minutes for candidate questions).
- Identify the “sell” requirements for this stage (what must the interviewer convey about the role/company).

### Step 2 — Create the criteria + anchors (anti-“vibes”)
- Use 4–8 criteria max.
- For each criterion, define:
  - **Strong looks like:** 1–2 concrete behaviors/outcomes
  - **Weak looks like:** 1–2 anti-signals
  - **Evidence hints:** what to listen for (metrics, trade-offs, constraints, ownership)

Tip: if your company has values/leadership principles, map questions to them (as Bill Carr suggests in the source skill).

### Step 3 — Write behavioral questions and probing ladders
Good behavioral question shape:
- “Tell me about a time you ___.”

Probe ladder (use 3–6 as needed):
- What was the context and goal?
- What was *your* role? What did *you* decide/do?
- What constraints were present (time, people, tech, politics)?
- What trade-offs did you make and why?
- What happened (result)? How do you know?
- What would you do differently now?

Avoid:
- Double-barreled questions (two topics in one)
- Leading questions that put words in the candidate’s mouth
- Trivia questions that measure memorization rather than judgment

### Step 4 — Add global questions that reveal meta-signal
From the source skill:
- **“How did you prepare for this interview?”** reveals planning, systems, seriousness, and research depth.
- **“Why do you want to work here?”** reveals mission alignment and whether the candidate did basic homework.

Use these as:
- Early questions in a screen (fast filter), or
- Mid-interview questions when you need more context on motivation and approach.

### Step 5 — Protect against false positives/negatives (substance vs delivery)
From the source skill (Jackie Bavaro): some candidates sound great because they answer in neat numbered lists.

Countermeasures:
- Ask for specifics (numbers, artifacts, decisions) when delivery is polished.
- Ask for counterfactuals (“what would you do if X changed?”) to test reasoning, not rehearsed narratives.
- If a candidate is less structured, rephrase the question and clarify what kind of example you need (without providing the answer).

### Step 6 — Take notes for evidence, then score
Note-taking rules:
- Capture **facts + decisions + outcomes**, not impressions.
- Separate **what happened** from **your interpretation**.

Scoring rules:
- Score each criterion independently using anchors.
- Write 2–4 evidence bullets per criterion.
- Write the overall recommendation last, after criterion scoring.

### Step 7 — Close well and preserve late-breaking signal
From the source skill (Christopher Lochhead): the most important thing sometimes comes out at the end.

Close sequence:
1) “What questions do you have for me?”
2) “Is there anything else you want to make sure we covered today?”
3) Set expectations for next steps (timeline, point of contact)

## Safety and fairness notes (non-legal)
- Don’t ask about protected classes or sensitive personal data.
- Offer accommodations and avoid “gotcha” interviewing.
- If you’re unsure about legality/compliance, escalate to HR/legal.
