# Intake (Question Bank)

Use this to gather the minimum information required to produce a Team Culture Operating System Pack. Ask **3–5 questions at a time**.

## 1) Team context
1) What team is this (function), and what outcomes are you responsible for in the next 3–6 months?
2) Team size and composition (roles/levels); any recent hires/exits or reorg?
3) Working model (remote/hybrid/in-office) and time zones.
4) Who is the sponsor/decision maker, and what support do you have from leadership?

## 2) What’s happening (symptoms + examples)
5) What feels “off” about the culture? Share 2–5 anonymized examples (what happened, what people did, impact).
6) Where do you see **low psychological safety** (silence, blame, lack of disagreement, fear of mistakes)?
7) Where are decisions slow or confusing? What decisions get stuck most often?
8) Where do you see **stagnation** (lack of ambition/creativity/visible progress)?

## 3) What you want instead (target state)
9) If this worked in 8 weeks, what would be measurably different in day-to-day behavior?
10) What are 3 “non-negotiables” you want to preserve (strengths of the current culture)?
11) What are 1–3 “sacred cows” (taboos, legacy processes, untouchable assumptions) that might be holding the team back?

## 4) Existing artifacts + constraints
12) Do you already have stated values, principles, a handbook, onboarding, performance expectations, or meeting cadences? (Paste links/excerpts if shareable.)
13) Constraints: timeline, meeting load, confidentiality/PII rules, union/HR policies, budget for offsites.

## 5) Rollout + reinforcement
14) What levers do you control: hiring, onboarding, performance expectations, rituals, team structure?
15) Any upcoming moments to anchor change (offsite, planning cycle, new launch, reorg)?
