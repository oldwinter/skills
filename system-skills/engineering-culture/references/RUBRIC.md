# Scoring Rubric (Engineering Culture Operating System Pack)

Score each dimension from **1 (poor)** to **5 (excellent)**. Target: mostly 4–5.

## 1) Clarity of scope and contracts
1: Vague scope; unclear inputs/outputs.  
3: Reasonable scope; some ambiguity.  
5: Clear boundaries, minimum inputs, and explicit deliverables.

## 2) Evidence-based diagnosis
1: Generic claims with no evidence.  
3: Some examples/metrics; gaps remain.  
5: Clear evidence, assumptions labeled, instrumentation gaps identified.

## 3) Capability model completeness (tech/arch/culture/lean)
1: Focuses only on tools or only on “values”.  
3: Covers multiple buckets but misses important gaps.  
5: Balanced capability map with actionable initiatives per gap.

## 4) Actionability and specificity
1: Advice-only; no owners, sequencing, or checks.  
3: Some concrete actions; limited sequencing/ownership.  
5: Backlog is prioritized with owners, effort ranges, dependencies, and metrics.

## 5) Org ↔ architecture alignment (Conway’s Law)
1: Mentions Conway’s Law without analysis.  
3: Identifies misalignments; weak transition plan.  
5: Clear misalignments, proposed boundaries/interfaces, transition steps, and trade-offs.

## 6) Clock speed + quality guardrails
1: “Move faster” without safety.  
3: Targets exist; guardrails unclear.  
5: Targets + guardrails + concrete system improvements that increase throughput safely.

## 7) Workflow contract + cross-functional fit
1: Ignores how work actually flows across functions.  
3: Defines workflow but missing SLAs/escalations.  
5: Clear end-to-end contract (issue→PR→deploy→learn), non-engineer participation defined, failure modes addressed.

## 8) AI-assisted development norms
1: Either bans AI or endorses it without controls.  
3: Basic guidance; weak review/safety expectations.  
5: Explicit allowed uses, required human checks, review expectations, and safe data handling.

## 9) Rollout and reinforcement
1: “Announce the doc.”  
3: Some rollout steps; unclear cadence/ownership.  
5: 30/60/90 plan, rituals, comms, measurement, and reinforcement mechanisms.
