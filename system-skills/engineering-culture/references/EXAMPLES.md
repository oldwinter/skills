# Examples

**Example 1 (slow delivery + DevEx):** “Use `engineering-culture`. Context: B2B SaaS, 35 engineers, monolith + a few services, weekly releases, rising incidents. Goal: increase shipping speed without quality regressions. Output: an Engineering Culture Operating System Pack with a clock-speed backlog and a workflow contract.”

**Example 2 (Conway misalignment):** “We have 6 teams but architecture ownership is unclear and everything depends on platform. Analyze Conway’s Law issues and propose a new operating model + standardization (leveling, code ownership, on-call) plus a rollout plan.”

**Boundary example:** “Write a generic essay about what engineering culture is.”  
Response: explain this skill produces a concrete operating system pack; ask for context/symptoms/timeline or provide the intake checklist and an example template from `references/TEMPLATES.md`.
