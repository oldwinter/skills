# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands the steps in `../SKILL.md` with practical heuristics and common failure modes.

## Step 1 — Intake + current state snapshot

Heuristics:
- Treat this as a **constraints + timeline** problem before it’s a “dream job” problem.
- If the user is burned out, shrink scope: focus on the next **2 weeks**, not the next 5 years.

Common failure modes:
- Skipping constraints (“I’ll figure it out”) → later regret.
- Trying to decide without a timeline → endless research.

## Step 2 — Progress metric + push/pull map

Heuristics:
- “More money” is often a proxy. Ask: *more money for what progress?* (learning, autonomy, stability, status).
- Push/pull should be specific and observable (“no mentorship”, “shipping once/quarter”, “I never talk to users”).

Common failure modes:
- Making every criterion a must-have → no real trade-offs.
- Treating temporary frustrations as permanent truths.

## Step 3 — Genie goal + backcast

Heuristics:
- The “genie” question removes fear-of-failure and reveals what the user actually wants.
- Backcasting should produce **near-term actions**, not just a narrative.

Common failure modes:
- A vision with no constraints → fantasy.
- A realistic plan with no motivation → burnout.

## Step 4 — Target archetypes + fit filters

Heuristics:
- Aim for **2–4 archetypes**, not 12. Fewer options → better experiments.
- Include “culture/home” fit signals (people, trust, how decisions get made), not just role title.

Common failure modes:
- Confusing job titles with day-to-day work.
- Ignoring environment fit (manager quality, autonomy, trust).

## Step 5 — Option scorecard + decision rule

Heuristics:
- Use weights to force trade-offs; keep it lightweight.
- Convert unknowns into **tests** (what conversation or artifact would resolve it?).

Common failure modes:
- Overfitting to a spreadsheet and ignoring intuition.
- No explicit “walk-away line” (constraints violated).

## Step 6 — Opportunity pipeline (network + serendipity)

Heuristics:
- Careers often move through **serendipity**. Your job is to increase surface area.
- Build goodwill by helping others (introductions, feedback, sharing resources) without immediate asks.
- A pipeline needs cadence: e.g., 3 outreach messages/week, 1 conversation/week.

Common failure modes:
- “Networking” with no tracking or routine.
- Waiting for postings instead of building relationships.

## Step 7 — Skills & proof plan

Heuristics:
- Prefer proof artifacts that are **job-relevant** and **small enough to finish**.
- If the user lacks runway, prioritize proof that improves hiring odds quickly (portfolio/case study, targeted project).

Common failure modes:
- Taking a course without producing proof.
- Trying to learn everything before talking to anyone.

## Step 8 — Experiments + quality gate

Heuristics:
- The goal is not certainty; it’s reducing uncertainty enough to make a good decision.
- A sabbatical can be framed as retention: a small fraction of a long career.

Common failure modes:
- Running experiments without capturing learnings (no notes, no decision updates).
- Ending with “it depends” and no next steps scheduled.
