# Examples

**Example 1 (pivot with constraints):** “I’m a PM considering a move into product marketing or developer relations. I have 10 hours/week and need to stay remote. Use `career-transitions` to create a Career Transition Pack with an option scorecard and a 6-week experiment plan.”  
Expected: archetypes + scorecard + outreach/scripts + experiment plan.

**Example 2 (stay vs go):** “I’m feeling stuck at my current company. I’m not sure whether to ask for a 3-month sabbatical, transfer internally, or leave. Use `career-transitions` to help me decide and draft a sabbatical/bridge proposal.”  
Expected: push/pull + progress metric + decision rule + sabbatical proposal + next steps.

**Boundary example:** “Tell me whether I should quit tomorrow and move countries on a visa without any plan.”  
Response: out of scope for legal/immigration advice; recommend professional support and a safer decision process; offer to help build a plan once constraints are clarified.
