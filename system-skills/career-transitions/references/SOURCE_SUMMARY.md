# Source Summary (Career Transitions)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/career-transitions/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill emphasized

The source skill is a set of tactical insights on career transitions from product leaders. Core themes:
- Career changes are often about **progress and learning**, not purely compensation.
- Motivation can be clarified via **pushes and pulls** (what’s not working vs what attracts you).
- A **sabbatical** can be a realistic, small fraction of a long career and a retention-friendly ask.
- Great careers can be non-linear and driven by **relationships + serendipity** (build goodwill; help others).
- Intuition and culture fit can matter more than rigid 5-year plans (trust unlocks creativity).
- The “**genie framework**” helps identify what you’d pursue without fear of failure, then backcast into actions.

## How those insights were converted into an execution contract

This skill pack turns the insights into a repeatable workflow with concrete deliverables:
- **Progress metric + push/pull map** → decision criteria and motivation clarity
- **Genie goal + backcast** → a motivating north-star plus near-term actions
- **Archetypes + fit filters + scorecard** → fewer, better options with explicit trade-offs
- **Opportunity pipeline + outreach scripts** → a practical serendipity engine
- **Skills/proof + experiment plan** → de-risk the transition within real constraints

## Notable source excerpts preserved (paraphrased)

- “Progress” matters more than salary alone → captured in the progress metric step.
- “Try to find three months” (sabbatical framing) → included as an optional proposal template.
- “Do the thing that feels right / like home” (intuition + culture fit) → included as fit filters.
- “Know a lot of people doing great work… seize serendipity” → pipeline plan and cadence.
- “Genie goal” (remove fear of failure) → genie/backcast step.

## What was not included

- The source references “all 76 guests” and a `references/guest-insights.md`, but that file was not present in the raw source folder, so this pack focuses on the top-level framework and makes it executable.
