# Checklists (Career Transitions)

Use these before finalizing the Career Transition Pack.

## Structural checklist (must pass)

- Includes all required deliverables (snapshot, push/pull, backcast, archetypes, scorecard, pipeline, skills/proof, experiments, risks/open questions/next steps).
- Constraints and timeline are explicit (no “someday” plan).
- Assumptions and unknowns are listed and used to drive experiments.
- Scorecard criteria match the user’s progress metric and are weighted.
- Outreach plan includes a weekly cadence and next-7-days scheduled actions.

## Decision-quality checklist

- There are only 2–4 archetypes (not a giant list).
- Each archetype has clear fit signals and no-go signals.
- The decision rule states what evidence is required to decide.
- The plan respects runway/time constraints.
- The pack includes a “stop doing” list (what not to pursue right now).

## Experiment checklist

- Each experiment has a goal, steps, and a pass/fail signal.
- Experiments resolve the biggest unknowns first.
- Learnings clearly update the scorecard (not “interesting” notes).
- The next 2 weeks include at least 1 conversation and 1 proof artifact.

## Safety + ethics checklist

- No requests for secrets, confidential employer information, or inappropriate data.
- Flags when professional advice is needed (legal/immigration, financial/tax, clinical mental health).
- Avoids irreversible decisions; suggests a safer plan if the user is in crisis.
