# Intake (question bank)

Ask up to **5** questions, then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## A) Goal + scope
1) What **taste domain** are we calibrating? (pick 1) onboarding, activation, navigation/IA, editor/workflow, pricing/packaging UX, notifications, retention loops, trust/safety, performance/latency feel, copy/voice
2) Who is the **target user** and what is their top **job-to-be-done** in this domain?
3) What decision will this work inform? (e.g., redesign direction, critique standard, experiment backlog, PM skill-building)
4) What’s the **time box**? (single 60–120 min sprint vs 2–4 week practice plan)

## B) Constraints + context
5) Platform + constraints: web/mobile, accessibility level, compliance, brand voice, markets/geos, technical limitations
6) Where are you starting from? (existing flow, new concept, competitor catch-up, quality bar reset)

## C) Benchmarks + references
7) Any known benchmark products you admire (or dislike) for this domain?
8) Should we include “outside-category” references? (default: yes, 2–3)

## D) Evidence + validation access
9) What evidence is available today? (analytics, funnel, session replays, support tickets, interviews)
10) What validation methods are feasible this week? (usability calls, prototype tests, A/B, copy test, dogfooding)

## E) Output preferences
11) Should the output be **in-chat Markdown** or written as **files**? If files, what folder path?
12) Any preferences for tone/voice (e.g., direct, brand-aligned), or a rubric style you already use?
