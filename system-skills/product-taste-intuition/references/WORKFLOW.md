# Workflow (expanded)

This expands the 8-step workflow in `../SKILL.md` with suggested time boxes and optional variations.

## Suggested formats

### Option 1: 90-minute Taste Calibration Sprint
- Step 1–2 (15 min): narrow domain + define criteria/tradeoffs
- Step 3 (10 min): pick benchmark set (5–7)
- Step 4 (45 min): study 3–4 benchmarks deeply (time-box per product)
- Step 5–7 (15 min): synthesize rules → hypotheses → minimal validation
- Step 8 (5 min): risks/open questions/next steps

### Option 2: 2–4 week Taste Practice Loop
- Week 1: pick domain + build benchmark set + baseline critique
- Weeks 2–3: exposure hours (3–5 sessions/week) + weekly synthesis
- Week 4: consolidate rules + create an experiment backlog + retrospective

## Notes on “product taste”
- Treat taste as a **skill**, built through exposure + analysis (not an innate trait).
- Start with **self-observation**: what delights/annoys/confuses you and why.
- Validate with reality: intuition is a **hypothesis generator**, not a substitute for evidence.

## Variations

### If you have no benchmarks
- Propose 2–3 benchmark shortlists:
  - Direct category leaders
  - Adjacent “experience leaders” (often outside-category)
  - “Anti-benchmarks” (popular but frustrating patterns to avoid)

### If you have strong opinions but no evidence
- Capture “gut feels” verbatim, then convert to falsifiable hypotheses in the log.
- Prefer quick qual checks (5 users) over debating internally.

### If you’re calibrating team taste (not just personal)
- Run a short async exercise:
  - Everyone critiques the same 2 benchmarks using the same template
  - Compare notes, resolve disagreements into explicit tradeoffs
  - Produce a shared “taste rules” doc and reuse it in PRDs/specs
