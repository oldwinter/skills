# Checklists

Use these before finalizing the Taste Calibration Pack.

## 1) Pack completeness (must-have)
- [ ] A single, explicit **taste domain** is chosen (not “product quality” in general).
- [ ] Target **user + job** are stated.
- [ ] “Good” criteria are **observable** and include **tradeoffs / non-goals**.
- [ ] Benchmark set includes **5–10** items and at least **2 outside-category** references (or justification for not doing so).
- [ ] Study notes include **concrete moments** (what happened) before interpretation.
- [ ] Taste rules are written as **DO / DO NOT** and reference supporting evidence.
- [ ] Hypotheses are **testable** with predicted signals + counter-signals.
- [ ] Validation plan uses the **smallest viable tests** that fit the time box.
- [ ] A 2–4 week **practice cadence** is specified (even if the immediate output is a 90-minute sprint).
- [ ] Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.

## 2) “Taste rule” quality
- [ ] Rule is specific enough to apply to a UI decision this week.
- [ ] Rule describes *when* it applies and includes exceptions.
- [ ] Rule is not merely “make it simpler / better / clearer” without a mechanism.
- [ ] Rule has ≥ 2 evidence points or is explicitly marked “hypothesis”.

## 3) Hypothesis quality
- [ ] Hypothesis is falsifiable (clear fail condition).
- [ ] The predicted signal is measurable (qual tags or quant metrics).
- [ ] The smallest viable test does not require sensitive or unavailable data.

## 4) Validation plan realism
- [ ] Tests fit the time box and staffing realities.
- [ ] There is a decision rule (what you’ll do if it passes/fails).
- [ ] You’re not over-indexing on one method (mix qual + quant where feasible).
