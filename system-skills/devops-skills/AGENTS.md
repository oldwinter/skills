# system-skills/devops-skills

## OVERVIEW
Operational runbooks and CLIs (AWS, kubectl, ArgoCD, Kargo, GitHub/GitLab).

## WHERE TO LOOK
| Task | Location |
|------|----------|
| Kubernetes ops | `kubectl/SKILL.md` |
| AWS CLI ops | `aws-cli/SKILL.md` |
| GitOps deploys | `argocd-cli/SKILL.md`, `kargo-cli/SKILL.md` |
| Prod/staging promotion | `sync-to-prod/SKILL.md` |

## ANTI-PATTERNS
- Some skills include hard safety rules (e.g., “never sync prod automatically”). Treat them as policy.
