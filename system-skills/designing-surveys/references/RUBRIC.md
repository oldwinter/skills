# Rubric (Designing Surveys)

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = poor, 3 = acceptable, 5 = excellent). Include notes and a short improvement plan for any score ≤ 3.

## 1) Decision clarity
- **1:** No decision; survey is “general feedback”.
- **3:** Decision exists but is broad; success criteria are unclear.
- **5:** Clear decision + deadline + explicit “what we’ll do if…” scenarios.

## 2) Audience + sampling quality
- **1:** Audience is vague (“all users”); sampling is unrealistic.
- **3:** Audience mostly defined; sample constraints acknowledged.
- **5:** Clear cohort definition (behavior + recency), segment cuts planned, and bias/coverage gaps documented.

## 3) Measurement design (metrics + diagnostics)
- **1:** Metrics are unclear; questions don’t map to decisions.
- **3:** Core metric exists; some diagnostics are actionable.
- **5:** Metric + diagnostics are tightly linked to decisions; prioritization + frequency/impact weighting produce a ranked output.

## 4) Questionnaire quality (clarity + bias control)
- **1:** Leading, double-barreled, jargon-heavy; too long.
- **3:** Mostly clear; a few risky questions remain.
- **5:** Neutral, single-concept questions; consistent scales; completion time meets target.

## 5) Instrument QA (mobile + logic)
- **1:** Mobile/logic untested; required fields excessive.
- **3:** Basic QA done; some edge cases remain.
- **5:** Mobile rendering verified; logic correct; option order and “N/A/Other” handled intentionally.

## 6) Analysis + reporting plan
- **1:** “We’ll look at results” with no plan.
- **3:** Segment cuts exist; open-ended analysis is rough.
- **5:** Predefined cuts, coding plan, decision thresholds, and a clear reporting format tied to actions.

## 7) Actionability + close-the-loop
- **1:** Results won’t change anything; no follow-up.
- **3:** Some actions implied; follow-up is vague.
- **5:** Clear owners/next steps implied, and respondents will hear back through a defined channel.

## 8) Privacy + ethics
- **1:** Sensitive data collected unnecessarily; no mitigation.
- **3:** Basic minimization; unknowns noted.
- **5:** Minimization is explicit; consent/retention/review requirements are captured.

## Suggested overall rating
- **Excellent:** avg ≥ 4.2, no dimension < 4
- **Good:** avg 3.5–4.1, no dimension < 3
- **Needs work:** avg < 3.5 or any dimension < 3
