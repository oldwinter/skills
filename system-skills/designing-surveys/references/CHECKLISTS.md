# Checklists (Designing Surveys)

Use these checklists before finalizing your **Survey Pack**.

## A) Decision + scope checklist
- [ ] A specific decision is named and time-bounded.
- [ ] The survey has one primary goal (not “everything”).
- [ ] You can map every question to a decision, hypothesis, or segment cut.
- [ ] You have a clear boundary of what this survey will *not* answer.

## B) Audience + sampling checklist
- [ ] Primary audience is defined with behavior/recency (not “all users”).
- [ ] Sampling frame is realistic for the chosen channel(s).
- [ ] Segment cuts are explicit (buyer vs user, plan tier, tenure, etc.).
- [ ] You have a plan for low response rate (reminder, incentive, widening window).
- [ ] If recall matters, cohort targets users who adopted ~3–6 months ago.

## C) Measurement + question quality checklist
- [ ] Core metric is chosen appropriately (often CSAT).
- [ ] Scales are 5–7 points where precision matters; endpoints are labeled.
- [ ] If NPS is used, it’s treated as one input and paired with a diagnostic follow-up.
- [ ] Diagnostics force prioritization when needed (“pick top 3”, not “check all”).
- [ ] Frequency/impact is captured for friction drivers (so the backlog is weighted).
- [ ] No double-barreled questions; no leading language; no jargon.
- [ ] Completion time is within target (default ≤ 3–6 minutes).

## D) Instrument QA checklist (mobile + logic + bias)
- [ ] All scale options are visible on mobile (no hidden numbers/labels).
- [ ] Required questions are minimal and justified.
- [ ] Skip logic is correct and prevents irrelevant questions.
- [ ] “Not applicable” exists where needed to avoid forced noise.
- [ ] “Other (free text)” exists where the option list may be incomplete.
- [ ] Option order is randomized where order bias is likely.

## E) Launch + operations checklist
- [ ] Pilot plan exists (10–20 responses or internal dogfood).
- [ ] Launch schedule + reminder cadence are defined (no spam).
- [ ] Monitoring plan: response rate, completion rate, drop-off, segment mix.
- [ ] Close-the-loop plan exists (what respondents will hear back and when).

## F) Analysis + reporting checklist
- [ ] Segment cuts are predefined (avoid post-hoc fishing).
- [ ] Open-ended coding plan exists (tag list + rules + output format).
- [ ] Decision thresholds are defined (“if X then Y”).
- [ ] Reporting format is chosen for the audience (memo/dashboard/backlog).
- [ ] Insights translate into actions (backlog items, messaging changes, onboarding updates).

## G) Privacy + ethics checklist (baseline)
- [ ] Data minimization: only collect what you will use.
- [ ] Sensitive personal data is avoided unless necessary (and flagged for review).
- [ ] Consent/notice is appropriate for the channel and policy.
- [ ] Storage/retention policy is known or explicitly marked as unknown.
