# Workflow (Expanded) — Coaching PMs

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance, heuristics, and common failure modes.

## Step 1 — Intake + boundaries + coaching goal
Heuristics:
- Coaching is about building the PM’s independent judgment; avoid becoming the “answer machine”.
- Be explicit whether this is **development coaching** vs **performance management**. If it’s performance management, involve HR and use your company process.

Common failure modes:
- Starting with advice before agreeing on what “good” means.
- Optimizing for activity (“do more research”) instead of outcomes (“make a decision with evidence”).

## Step 2 — Define “good PM” in your context
Use Petra Wille’s sequence: start with a shared definition of a good product person *in your context*.

Suggested competency areas (edit for your org):
- **Problem framing & insight** (JTBD, research, data, opportunity sizing)
- **Strategy & prioritization** (bets, sequencing, rationale, tradeoffs)
- **Execution & delivery** (planning, risk management, iteration, quality)
- **Stakeholder leadership** (alignment, decision-making, conflict, comms)
- **Product craft** (PRDs/specs, narratives, UX judgment, edge cases)
- **Business acumen** (unit economics, go-to-market, pricing, metrics)

### Using Bloom’s Taxonomy for skill depth (Bangaly Kaba)
Treat each competency as a ladder of thinking depth:
- **Knowledge:** can name concepts and vocabulary
- **Comprehension:** can explain concepts in their own words
- **Application:** can apply concepts on real work with support
- **Analysis:** can break down tradeoffs, diagnose root causes
- **Synthesis:** can create a new approach/strategy under constraints
- **Evaluation:** can judge options, justify decisions, and teach others

Practical tip:
- For each competency, pick 1–2 “anchor behaviors” per Bloom level (observable actions or artifacts).

## Step 3 — Assess current capability using evidence
Principles:
- Use artifacts and decisions as evidence (docs, plans, writeups, launches).
- Separate **skill gaps** from **context gaps**:
  - Skill gap: doesn’t know how to do the work yet
  - Context gap: unclear mandate, missing data, no authority, shifting priorities

Evidence sources (low-friction):
- 2–5 recent artifacts (PRD, roadmap slice, decision brief, launch plan)
- 1–2 stakeholder feedback summaries (anonymized)
- PM self-assessment (optional, structured)

## Step 4 — Choose 1–3 growth bets + shared vision
Heuristics:
- Pick the smallest number of bets that will create the biggest second-order effects.
- Prefer bets that show up in multiple places (e.g., weak problem framing affects prioritization, execution, comms).
- State targets as behaviors and artifacts, not traits.

Example growth bet statement:
- “Move ‘problem framing’ from Apply → Analyze by consistently producing a 1-page opportunity assessment with explicit tradeoffs.”

## Step 5 — Build a development plan with reps
Petra’s step: development plan + follow-up.

Design each bet with:
- **Stretch assignment:** real work with real constraints
- **Weekly reps:** small, repeatable practice (30–90 minutes)
- **Artifacts:** what the PM produces (docs, narratives, decisions)
- **Coach commitments:** what you will do (review, shadow, introduce stakeholders)
- **Measurement:** how you’ll know it improved (rubric + evidence)

Bloom-driven rep design:
- If current level is **Comprehension**, reps should force **Application** (do the thing on real work).
- If current level is **Application**, reps should force **Analysis** (explicit tradeoffs, root-cause thinking).
- If current level is **Analysis**, reps should force **Synthesis/Evaluation** (new strategy + clear rationale).

## Step 6 — Coaching cadence + session toolkit
Marty Cagan’s point: coaching is a primary responsibility of product leadership because it’s how you scale.

Good cadence pattern:
- Weekly or biweekly 1:1s + a lightweight async artifact review loop
- A predictable “practice + review” rhythm (reps → feedback → adjust)

Coaching prompts (examples):
- “What problem are we solving, and for whom? What evidence?”
- “What options did you consider? What tradeoffs did you reject?”
- “If this fails, why will it fail? What would you do differently?”
- “What would you do if you had half the time? Double the time?”

When to be directive:
- Safety/compliance risk, major customer impact, or time-critical decisions
- Repeated blind spots after coaching cycles (then reset expectations + structure)

## Step 7 — Follow-up loop + measurement
Make progress visible:
- Keep a simple tracker (bet → reps → artifacts → review outcomes)
- Review monthly: keep/adjust bets, remove constraints, celebrate wins

Common failure modes:
- No follow-up, so coaching turns into a series of one-off conversations.
- Too many bets, so nothing changes.

## Step 8 — Quality gate + finalize
Before shipping the pack:
- Run `references/CHECKLISTS.md`
- Score `references/RUBRIC.md`
- Include **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** even if the pack is partial.
