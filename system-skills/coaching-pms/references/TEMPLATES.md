# Templates — Coaching PMs

Use these templates to produce a PM Coaching Pack. Copy/paste and fill.

## 1) Definition of “Good PM” (template)

**PM role context:**  
- Team/product:  
- Stage: (0→1 / growth / enterprise / platform)  
- Scope + decision rights:  

**Competency model (edit to match your org):**

| Competency | What “good” looks like (observable behaviors) | Bloom depth ladder (how thinking scales) |
|---|---|---|
| Problem framing & insight |  | Knowledge → Comprehension → Application → Analysis → Synthesis → Evaluation |
| Strategy & prioritization |  | Knowledge → Comprehension → Application → Analysis → Synthesis → Evaluation |
| Execution & delivery |  | Knowledge → Comprehension → Application → Analysis → Synthesis → Evaluation |
| Stakeholder leadership |  | Knowledge → Comprehension → Application → Analysis → Synthesis → Evaluation |
| Product craft (docs, UX, edge cases) |  | Knowledge → Comprehension → Application → Analysis → Synthesis → Evaluation |
| Business acumen (metrics, GTM, economics) |  | Knowledge → Comprehension → Application → Analysis → Synthesis → Evaluation |

Notes:
- For each competency, add 1–2 anchor behaviors per Bloom level (optional).
- Prefer behaviors tied to artifacts (docs, decisions, plans).

## 2) Current Assessment (template)

**PM:**  
**Timeframe assessed:**  
**Evidence sources (links or summaries):**
-  

| Competency | Current Bloom level | Target Bloom level | Evidence (2–3 bullets) | Gap type (skill vs constraint) | Coaching priority (H/M/L) |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---:|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Strengths to compound (2–3):**
-  

**Constraints to remove (if any):**
-  

## 3) Shared Vision — Growth Bets (template)

Pick **1–3** bets for this coaching cycle.

| Growth bet | Why it matters (business + PM) | Target behavior/artifact | Success signals | Timeframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

## 4) Development Plan (template)

For each growth bet, define reps + stretch work + artifacts + measurement.

### Growth bet: <name>
**Hypothesis:** If the PM practices <X>, then <Y> will improve because <reason>.  
**Current → target Bloom level:** <e.g., Apply → Analyze>  

**Weekly reps (30–90 min each):**
- Rep #1:  
- Rep #2:  

**Stretch assignment (real work):**
-  

**Required artifacts (what they produce):**
-  

**Coach commitments (what you will do):**
- Review cadence:  
- Shadow/observe:  
- Introductions/unblocking:  

**Measurement (how we’ll know):**
- Rubric dimensions:  
- Evidence to collect:  

**Timeline + checkpoints:**
- Week 1:  
- Week 4:  
- Week 8/12:  

## 5) Coaching Cadence + Session Toolkit (template)

**Cadence:** (weekly / biweekly)  
**Format:** (1:1 + async doc reviews)  

**Default 1:1 agenda (copy/paste):**
1) Wins + energy check (5 min)  
2) Top decisions needed (10 min)  
3) Deep dive on one growth bet (20–30 min)  
4) Next reps + commitments (5–10 min)  

**Coaching prompts (pick 3–5):**
- What problem are we solving, and for whom? What evidence?  
- What options did you consider, and what tradeoffs did you reject?  
- What is the smallest test or decision we can make this week?  
- If this fails, why will it fail?  
- What would you do if you had half the time?  

**Artifact review points (scheduled):**
-  

**When to be directive (exceptions):**
- Safety/compliance risk; major customer impact; time-critical decisions.

## 6) Follow-up Tracker (template)

Track progress by bets, reps, and artifacts.

| Date | Growth bet | Rep/artifact completed | Coach feedback (1–3 bullets) | Next rep | Progress (on track / at risk) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

## 7) Risks / Open questions / Next steps (template)

**Risks**
-  

**Open questions**
-  

**Next steps (next 1–2 weeks)**
-
