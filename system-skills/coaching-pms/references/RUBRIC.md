# Rubric — Coaching PMs (1–5)

Score the PM Coaching Pack before finalizing. Total score helps decide whether to ask for more input or proceed with assumptions.

## 1) Definition clarity (in-context “good PM”)
1 = Vague traits (“be more strategic”); no behaviors  
3 = Some behaviors; missing scope/decision rights context  
5 = Clear behaviors tied to role scope + artifacts; context-specific

## 2) Evidence-based assessment
1 = Mostly opinions; little evidence  
3 = Some examples; gaps not clearly supported  
5 = Strong evidence mapped to competencies; uncertainty labeled

## 3) Growth bet selection
1 = Too many bets; no prioritization  
3 = 2–4 bets; partial rationale/success signals  
5 = 1–3 high-leverage bets with clear success signals + timeframe

## 4) Development plan specificity
1 = Generic advice; no reps/artifacts  
3 = Some actions; missing cadence or measurement  
5 = Weekly reps + stretch work + artifacts + measurement + coach commitments

## 5) Coaching cadence & toolkit
1 = No cadence/toolkit; ad-hoc coaching  
3 = Cadence exists; prompts/review points incomplete  
5 = Sustainable cadence + prompts + artifact review points + directive exceptions

## 6) Follow-up & adaptation
1 = No follow-up mechanism  
3 = Tracker exists; review cadence unclear  
5 = Tracker + review checkpoints + explicit adjust/iterate loop

## Interpreting scores
- **26–30:** ship as-is
- **20–25:** ship with explicit assumptions + unknowns list
- **< 20:** do another intake round (max 5 questions) before finalizing
