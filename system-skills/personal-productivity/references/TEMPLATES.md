## 4) Capture + To-Do System Spec

**Single trusted inbox:** (where everything gets captured)  
**Capture rule:** (e.g., capture within 60 seconds; never “remember later”)  

**Processing ritual (daily, ≤15 min)**
- Process time:  
- Steps: (convert to next actions; timebox; delegate; delete; defer)

**List taxonomy (keep small)**
- Today (max N items):  
- Next (unblocked):  
- Waiting (delegated / pending):  
- Someday/Backlog (optional):  

**Prioritization rule**
- (e.g., 1–3 outcomes/day; deadlines; “highest leverage first”; “must move a core responsibility”)

**Timeboxing rule**
- (e.g., every Today item either has a calendar block or a clear next action that fits a small window)

**Definition of done**
- (what counts as “done” vs “in progress”)

## 5) Daily Plan (Morning)

**Top outcomes (1–3):**
1)  
2)  
3)  

**First focus block (timeboxed):**  
**Meeting prep needed (10 minutes max):**  
**Admin buffer plan:**  

## 6) Shutdown Ritual (End of Day, 10–15 min)

- Capture any loose tasks into inbox
- Process inbox → timebox / next action / delegate / delete / defer
- Update “Waiting on” list (and send 1–3 follow-ups if needed)
- Pick tomorrow’s first focus block + timebox it
- Close loops: clear desktop/notes; quick “what to remember tomorrow” note

## 7) Weekly Review (30–45 min)

- Review calendar (last week + next 2 weeks)
- Review lists: Today / Next / Waiting / Backlog
- Identify top 3 outcomes for next week
- Timebox next week’s focus blocks
- Make a “kill list”: delete/defer/renegotiate low-value items
- Decide 1–2 improvements to test next week
