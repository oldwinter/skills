# Examples — Personal Productivity

These are example prompts and the kinds of artifacts you should produce (summarized).

## Example 1 — “Wall-to-wall meetings + advising”
Prompt:
> “I’m a product lead with 25–30 hours/week of meetings and I advise a startup. Build me a personal productivity system that protects deep work and stops tasks from slipping.”

Expected artifacts (high-level):
- Context Snapshot with constraints (meeting load, advising hours, hard stops)
- Commitment inventory including advising commitment
- Weekly timebox plan with meeting windows + ≥3 focus blocks + explicit weekend spillover rule (if needed)
- Capture/to-do system: one inbox, small lists, daily processing ≤15 minutes, “waiting on”
- Daily shutdown checklist and weekly review checklist
- 7-day rollout plan + measures (dropped tasks/week, deep-work blocks/week)
- Risks/open questions/next steps

## Example 2 — “Dropped follow-ups”
Prompt:
> “I forget follow-ups from meetings and lose track of small tasks. I need a simple system, not a new app.”

Expected artifacts (high-level):
- Capture rule (≤60 seconds) + single inbox definition
- Processing ritual (≤15 minutes) + list taxonomy (Today/Next/Waiting)
- Daily shutdown ritual that guarantees meeting follow-ups get captured and scheduled
- Minimal weekly review to prevent backlog bloat

## Boundary example — “Medical advice”
Prompt:
> “Tell me what medication to take so I can focus.”

Response shape:
- Decline medical advice; suggest professional support.
- Offer the neutral system components (capture + timeboxing) and ask for work constraints only.
