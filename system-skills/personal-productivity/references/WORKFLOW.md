# Workflow (Expanded) — Personal Productivity

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance, heuristics, and failure modes.

## Step 1 — Intake + success definition + boundaries
Aim: avoid generic “productivity tips”; produce a system with measurable outcomes.

Heuristics:
- Define 1–2 metrics that can move in 2 weeks (dropped tasks/week, deep-work blocks/week, weekend spillover hours).
- Clarify whether the user wants a full system or just (a) timeboxing or (b) capture/to-do.

Common failure modes:
- Making the plan too complex (“new app + new method + new ritual” all at once).
- Slipping into medical/therapy advice; keep it work-system focused.

## Step 2 — Commitment & workload inventory
Aim: reveal what’s actually consuming time and attention.

Tactics:
- Separate **fixed** commitments (recurring meetings, standing obligations) from **flexible** workload.
- Identify the top 3 sources of fragmentation (constant context switching, reactive Slack, no buffers).

Failure modes:
- Treating “responsibilities” as tasks without naming time cost or cadence.

## Step 3 — Weekly timebox plan (default week)
Aim: make focus time real by turning it into calendar blocks.

Timeboxing guidance:
- Start with **meeting windows** (e.g., 11–4) and protect at least one focus block outside those windows.
- Use buffers (10–30 minutes) after high-context meetings.
- If weekends exist: timebox them explicitly (e.g., 2×2-hour blocks) rather than letting work leak indefinitely.

Failure modes:
- A schedule that assumes everyone else will comply (no booking rules, no buffers, no trade-offs).

## Step 4 — Capture + to-do system spec (“write it down”)
Aim: eliminate “open loops” by externalizing memory.

System rules (default):
- One trusted **inbox** (capture everything within 60 seconds).
- Process the inbox daily (≤15 minutes) into: timeboxed block, next action, delegate, delete, or defer.
- Keep the taxonomy small; prefer fewer lists over complex tagging.

Failure modes:
- Replacing “forgetting tasks” with “over-maintaining the system”.

## Step 5 — Daily plan + shutdown ritual
Aim: keep the system alive on busy days.

Tactics:
- Morning: choose 1–3 outcomes, then timebox the first one.
- During day: capture new tasks immediately; don’t context-switch to do them.
- End of day: clear inbox, update “waiting on”, pick tomorrow’s first block.

Failure modes:
- Creating a daily routine that takes 45+ minutes (won’t stick).

## Step 6 — Weekly review ritual
Aim: prevent drift and backlog bloat.

Checklist guidance:
- Look ahead 2 weeks for deadlines and “hidden” prep work.
- Run a short “kill list” pass: delete/defer/renegotiate low-value items.

Failure modes:
- Weekly review becomes a perfection ritual instead of a reset.

## Step 7 — Quality gate + rollout plan
Aim: make it implementable, not aspirational.

Tactics:
- Roll out in 7 days: setup → first week experiments → adjust.
- Pick 2–3 experiments max (e.g., meeting windows + daily shutdown + weekend spillover rule).

Failure modes:
- Too many changes at once, no decision rules, and no feedback loop.
