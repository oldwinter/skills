# Checklists — Personal Productivity

Use these checklists to verify the pack is realistic, simple, and implementable.

## A) Inputs completeness checklist
- Role and responsibilities are stated (not vague)
- Constraints/non-negotiables are explicit (time zones, hard stops, deadlines)
- A representative week exists (calendar dump, recurring meetings list, or narrative)
- Current task capture method and tools are known (or defaults chosen)
- Success definition for 2–4 weeks is explicit (1–2 signals)

## B) Weekly timebox plan checklist
- Includes meeting windows (or a clear meeting-limit strategy)
- Includes **≥3 focus blocks/week** (or a justified exception)
- Includes buffers for admin and transitions (not wishful thinking)
- Protects at least one non-negotiable personal block (if provided)
- Has explicit rules for booking meetings (agenda, duration, lead time)
- Weekend spillover is timeboxed with limits (if weekends are used)

## C) Capture + to-do system checklist
- Single trusted inbox exists (capture is ≤60 seconds)
- Daily processing ritual is defined and ≤15 minutes
- List taxonomy is small and understandable (no over-engineering)
- Every item resolves to one of: timeboxed, next action, delegate, delete, defer
- “Waiting on” is explicitly tracked to prevent silent drops

## D) Daily + weekly rituals checklist
- Morning plan is ≤10 minutes and selects 1–3 outcomes
- Shutdown ritual is ≤15 minutes and includes “tomorrow’s first block”
- Weekly review is ≤45 minutes and includes backlog cleanup (“kill list”)

## E) Rollout plan checklist
- Next 7 days have specific setup tasks and practices
- Changes are staged (not a full overhaul on day 1)
- Measures exist to evaluate improvement after 7–14 days
- Includes risks, open questions, and next steps
