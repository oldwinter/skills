# Intake (Building Sales Team)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **Stage + goal:** What stage are you (seed/Series A+), and what does “success” look like in the next 90 days? (pipeline, bookings, revenue, learning milestones)
2) **Sales motion:** PLG/inbound/outbound/enterprise? Who is the buyer vs user? Typical ACV and sales cycle?
3) **Repeatability evidence:** Over the last ~50–100 “at-bats”, what was your win rate from first meeting → closed-won (and why do you win/lose)?
4) **Demand source:** Where do opportunities come from today (founder outbound, product hand-raisers, partners, marketing)? What’s the volume/quality?
5) **Product complexity:** How technical is the sell? Who must be convinced (engineers, security, finance, execs)?

## Team constraints (as needed)
- Budget + headcount: can you hire **two reps** close together or only one?
- Do you have CS/support that can help close early deals or run onboarding?
- Any must-have geo/time zone/language constraints?
- Timeline: when must the first hire start? What’s the hiring market reality?

## Hiring preferences (optional)
- Which roles are you considering first: AE, SDR, hybrid, sales engineer, CS-as-closer?
- Do you want a player/coach (first sales leader) or individual contributors first?
- What’s non-negotiable in candidate profile (industry, technical fluency, founder-like, etc.)?

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A stated assumption for motion + ICP
- A **readiness gate** with measurable milestones (what to measure next)
- Two options:
  - **Option A:** Hire now (pilot) with conservative scope + learning cadence
  - **Option B:** Wait and keep founder-led selling until milestones are hit
- A minimal hiring plan (sequence + scorecards + interview loop) that can start immediately
