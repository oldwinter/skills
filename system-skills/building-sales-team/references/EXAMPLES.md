# Examples — Building Sales Team

## Example 1 — Seed-stage first AE hires (hire-two baseline)
**Prompt:**  
“Use `building-sales-team`. We’re seed-stage B2B SaaS. Founder has done 70 first meetings, closed 16, lost 40 (rest pending). Win rate ~23% (first meeting → closed-won). ACV $12k, cycle 30–45 days. We have 2,000 signups/month but upgrades are inconsistent. Budget: hire 2 AEs. Output: Sales Team Build Pack.”

**What “good” looks like:**
- Readiness gate clearly lands on “hire now (pilot)” and states what to measure in 30 days
- Sales motion spec defines “at-bat” and stage exit criteria
- Hiring plan hires **two AEs** close together with comparable cohorts (A/B baseline)
- Role scorecard includes “PM-like” product depth and a concrete way to test it
- Interview loop includes mock discovery + written follow-up + product deep-dive
- 30/60/90 ramp includes coaching cadence and leading indicators (not only quota)

## Example 2 — PLG → product-led sales pilot pod
**Prompt:**  
“Use `building-sales-team`. We have strong product hand-raisers (in-app ‘talk to sales’). We want to start product-led sales to close mid-market upgrades. We’re not ready for a big outbound motion. Output: team topology (pilot pod), hiring sequence, and a ramp plan.”

**What “good” looks like:**
- Team topology is **pilot-first** (AE + SDR or hybrid) attached to founder/PM for tight feedback
- Success criteria emphasize learning and conversion improvements (not quota theater)
- Handoff boundaries specify when CS/support closes vs when sales engages
- Ramp plan defines stage-by-stage conversion targets and weekly experiment reviews

## Boundary example — Too early / wrong problem
**Prompt:**  
“We don’t know our ICP, we have 2 customers (friends), and we want to hire a VP Sales to ‘build the whole GTM’.”

**Good response:**
- Explain this skill assumes a motion that can be written down and measured
- Recommend founder-led discovery/validation first (e.g., `founder-sales`)
- Provide a wait plan with milestones (at-bats, win rate, stable ICP) and a lightweight “motion spec” starter
