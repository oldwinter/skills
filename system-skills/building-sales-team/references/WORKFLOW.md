# Workflow — Building Sales Team (Sales Team Build Pack)

Use this as a deeper, copy/paste workflow companion to `../SKILL.md`.

## Step 1 — Readiness gate (hire now vs wait)
**Goal:** Avoid hiring “too early” and then blaming the rep for an unproven motion.

1) Collect baseline (or best estimate):
   - # first meetings in last 60–90 days
   - # closed-won and closed-lost (exclude friends/family “favors” if possible)
   - win rate from first meeting → closed-won
   - typical ACV + cycle length
   - top 3 win reasons + top 3 loss reasons
2) Decide which readiness path you’re on:
   - **Hire-now path:** you have organic demand and/or repeatable wins that can be written down
   - **Wait path:** wins are sporadic, mostly relationship-driven, or the ICP/use case is still shifting weekly
3) Output the decision as:
   - “**Hire now (pilot)** because …” + what you’ll measure in the next 30 days
   - or “**Wait** until …” + specific milestones (e.g., 50–100 at-bats, stable win rate, consistent hand-raisers)

## Step 2 — Write the sales motion spec (the thing you’re hiring into)
**Goal:** Make selling teachable and diagnosable.

Minimum sections:
- ICP + qualification (who is in / out)
- First meeting agenda + discovery focus
- Demo/pilot criteria (when to demo, when to propose a pilot)
- Pricing/packaging guardrails (what can/can’t be offered)
- Sales stages definitions + what counts as an “at-bat”
- Common objections + best current responses
- Founder vs rep responsibilities for 60–90 days (who does what)

## Step 3 — Choose team topology + hiring sequence
**Goal:** Start with the smallest team that can learn fast.

Pick one:
- **PLG/hand-raisers:** pilot pod (AE + SDR or hybrid) attached to founder for tight feedback loops
- **Outbound-heavy:** SDR + AE (or hybrid first) depending on deal complexity
- **High technical complexity:** consider early Sales Engineer coverage via founder/engineering/PM until dedicated SE is justified

Sequence hires:
1) First rep type (AE/SDR/hybrid)
2) Second hire (ideally close enough in time to create an A/B baseline)
3) Support roles (CS-as-closer, SE, RevOps) only when the bottleneck is clear

## Step 4 — Role scorecards (what “great” looks like)
**Goal:** Make hiring criteria explicit and testable.

For each role, define:
- Outcomes (30/60/90)
- Must-have signals (behaviors, skills, pattern matches)
- Red flags (anti-signals)
- Practical tests to validate signals
- “Bar raiser” criteria for technical products (product depth, engineer credibility, curiosity)

## Step 5 — Interview loop + debrief protocol
**Goal:** Reduce gut-feel hiring and ensure coverage of all signals.

Recommended loop components (adjust to role):
- Structured recruiter screen (motivation, pattern match, comp expectations)
- Hiring manager interview (process + learning ability)
- **Mock discovery** (diagnostic selling)
- **Product deep-dive** (can they reason about the product like a PM?)
- Written follow-up (clarity, customer empathy, next-step discipline)
- Reference checks (specific: “tell me about a time they learned a new domain fast”)

Debrief:
- Each interviewer submits scores before discussion
- Decide with scorecard + evidence, not vibes
- Record “why yes / why no” for calibration

## Step 6 — Onboarding + ramp + operating cadence
**Goal:** Preserve learning while creating accountability.

Include:
- Enablement assets: ICP sheet, motion spec, discovery script, pricing guardrails
- Shadowing plan + call recording review cadence
- Ramp targets and leading indicators (meetings, qualified pipeline, pilots started)
- Weekly cadence: pipeline review, call coaching, experiment review
- A/B testing approach: compare rep performance and diagnose process vs person

## Step 7 — Finalize with a quality gate
Run:
- [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) (must-haves)
- [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md) (score; identify gaps)

Always output:
- Risks
- Open questions
- Next steps (what happens this week)
