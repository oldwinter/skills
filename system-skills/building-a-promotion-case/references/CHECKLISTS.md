# Checklists (Quality Gates)

Use these checklists before finalizing the Promotion Case Pack.

## A) Pack completeness (must pass)
- [ ] Includes a clear **target level/title + timeline**
- [ ] Includes a 1–2 sentence **promotion thesis** tied to company priorities
- [ ] Includes an **expectations map** (ladder/competencies → next-level signals)
- [ ] Includes an **evidence log** with 3–8 high-signal examples
- [ ] Includes a **promotion doc one-pager** that is skimmable in 3 minutes
- [ ] Includes a **manager alignment plan** with written criteria + check-in dates
- [ ] Includes a **sponsor/visibility map** with specific next actions
- [ ] Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**

## B) Evidence quality
- [ ] Each major claim has **at least 2 evidence types** (metric/proxy + artifact/stakeholder proof)
- [ ] Impact is described with **before/after** and baseline when possible
- [ ] “I did work” is translated into **outcomes, scope, and decisions**
- [ ] Stakeholder quotes (2–6) are specific and map to competencies
- [ ] Confidential details are redacted/anonymized

## C) Ladder alignment
- [ ] Competencies are stated as **observable behaviors**
- [ ] The doc shows you already operate at the **next level**, not just potential
- [ ] Gaps are acknowledged with a concrete **plan** (not hand-waved)
- [ ] The narrative matches how your org defines scope/impact at the target level

## D) Manager + process readiness
- [ ] Promotion cycle deadlines are known (or explicitly assumed)
- [ ] Manager criteria are explicit and agreed (or clearly listed as unknowns)
- [ ] No surprises: key stakeholders are looped in before submission
- [ ] The packet is written in the style the decision-makers expect (committee vs manager-only)

## E) Narrative quality (exec skim test)
- [ ] TL;DR answers: **ask, why now, top impacts**
- [ ] The doc is easy to quote in a meeting (strong, short bullets)
- [ ] It reads as **low-risk** at the next level (sustained performance + leverage)
