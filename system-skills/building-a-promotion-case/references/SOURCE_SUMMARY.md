# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → Skill Pack)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/building-a-promotion-case/SKILL.md`

## What was preserved

The original skill was insight-heavy. This pack translates the key insights into rules, checks, and concrete artifacts:

1) **Be clear about what you want; make it easy to sponsor you (Claire Vo)**  
Converted to: promotion thesis + explicit outputs (one-pager + evidence log) + manager alignment plan that reduces sponsor friction and aligns to company priorities and the talent calendar.

2) **Use a manager partnership loop (“Magic Loop”) (Ethan Evans)**  
Converted to: a dedicated workflow step for manager criteria agreement + commitments + check-in cadence (“do current job well, ask how to help, do it, return with proof”).

3) **Political/power skills matter (Jeffrey Pfeffer)**  
Converted to: sponsor/visibility map + “politics as logistics” principle + outreach templates to collect credible stakeholder proof.

4) **Promotion vs career are related but distinct (Nikhyl Singhal)**  
Converted to: explicit intake question for “job after next” + guidance to align promotion to longer-term trajectory without treating promotion as the only signal of progress.

5) **Excellence in the current role first (Tamar Yehoshua)**  
Converted to: “table stakes first” rule + checklist items ensuring the packet includes current-level excellence signals, not only stretch claims.

## What was added (to make it executable)
- Explicit **input/output contracts** and an 8-step workflow
- Copy/paste **templates** for thesis, evidence log, ladder mapping, manager alignment, and sponsor plan
- **Checklists + rubric** as quality gates
- Safety boundaries for HR/performance escalation situations and confidentiality constraints
