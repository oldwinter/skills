# Examples

**Example 1 (typical):** “I’m a Senior PM and want to get promoted to Staff PM in the next cycle (May). Here’s our ladder excerpt and 5 projects I led. Build a promotion case doc + evidence log + manager alignment plan.”  
Expected: Promotion Case Pack with a ladder-mapped narrative and concrete manager check-ins.

**Example 2 (limited metrics):** “I’m a PM on an internal platform team. My impact is hard to measure. Help me build a promotion case using proxy metrics, stakeholder evidence, and artifacts.”  
Expected: Evidence log with proxies (cycle time, reliability, adoption, internal NPS) and explicit proof pointers.

**Boundary example:** “My manager refuses to discuss promotions and HR is involved in a performance process.”  
Response: recommend following HR/manager process first; offer to help later with evidence capture, role expectations, and a future readiness plan.
