# Templates (Copy/Paste)

Use these templates to produce the Promotion Case Pack. Keep language concrete and evidence-based.

## 1) Promotion thesis (2 sentences)
- **Ask:** Promote me to **<target level/title>** in **<cycle/date>**.
- **Thesis:** I already operate at **<target level>** by **<next-level behaviors>**, demonstrated by **<3 proof points tied to company priorities>**.

## 2) Next-level expectations map (table)

| Competency / expectation | What “next level” looks like here | My evidence (bullets) | Gaps / plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| <competency> | <observable behaviors> | <evidence pointers> | <what to do next> |

## 3) Evidence log (impact table)

| When | Initiative | Company problem | My role & decisions | Scope & stakeholders | Outcomes (metrics/proxies) | Artifacts | Ladder signals |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <date range> | <project> | <problem> | <what you did> | <teams> | <before/after> | <docs/dashboards> | <competencies> |

## 4) Promotion doc (one-pager)

### TL;DR
- **Ask:** <target level/title> in <cycle/date>
- **Why now:** <1–2 bullets>
- **Top impacts (3):** <impact bullets with metrics/proxies>

### Scope (current vs next level)
- **Today:** <what you own>
- **At next level:** <how you already operate there; increased leverage/scope>

### Ladder mapping summary
List 4–7 competencies with 1–2 bullets each:
- **<Competency>:** <claim> → <evidence pointer>

### What I’m taking on next (forward-looking)
- <next 1–3 scope bets tied to org priorities>

### Risks / open questions (preemptively)
- <risk> → <mitigation>

### Appendix (evidence)
- Links or summarized artifacts (no confidential details)
- Stakeholder quotes (2–6)

## 5) Manager alignment plan (“Magic Loop”)

### Criteria agreement
- **Target level:** <level>
- **Promotion date/cycle:** <date>
- **Manager criteria (3–5):**
  1) <criterion>
  2) <criterion>
  3) <criterion>

### Commitments (next 4–12 weeks)
| Week | Commitment | Output artifact | Proof of impact | Check-in |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <week> | <thing manager asked for> | <doc/launch> | <metric/proxy> | <date> |

### 1:1 agenda (promotion conversation)
1) Confirm target level + timeline
2) Review thesis + evidence highlights
3) Ask: “What would make you confident sponsoring me?”
4) Agree on criteria + next steps + check-in dates

## 6) Sponsor/visibility map

| Person | Influence on decision | Current relationship | What they need to believe | Evidence they’ll trust | Next action + date |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| <name/role> | High/Med/Low | Strong/OK/Weak | <belief> | <proof> | <ask> |

## 7) Request templates (feedback/endorsement)

### A) Ask for a short endorsement (Slack/Email)
Subject: Quick input for my promotion packet?

Hi <Name> — I’m preparing my promotion packet for <cycle>. Could you share 2–3 bullets on what you observed from me on <project>, especially related to <competency>?  
If it helps, here’s a 5-line summary of what I’m claiming: <paste>.

Thank you — <Name>

### B) Ask your manager to sponsor (email follow-up)
Subject: Promotion packet draft + criteria agreement

Hi <Manager> — sharing my draft promotion one-pager + evidence log.  
Can we align on 3–5 criteria you’d need to see to sponsor me for <cycle>, and schedule two check-ins before <deadline>?

Thanks — <Name>
