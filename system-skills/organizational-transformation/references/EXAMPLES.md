# Examples

**Example 1:** “VP Product at a legacy enterprise: teams ship features but outcomes don’t improve. Create a transformation plan toward empowered product teams.”  
Expected: diagnostic, target operating model blueprint, 90-day pilots, 6–12 month roadmap, governance metrics.

**Example 2:** “CEO: we tried SAFe/Spotify-style changes and got backlash. Build a nudge-first plan and comms to reduce rejection.”  
Expected: framework hygiene guardrails, small pilots, stakeholder messaging, reinforcement mechanisms.

**Boundary example:** “Write a plan to ‘implement the Spotify model’ verbatim.”  
Response: this skill treats frameworks as tools; it will instead produce a context-fit operating model and specify what (if anything) to borrow and how to validate via pilots.
