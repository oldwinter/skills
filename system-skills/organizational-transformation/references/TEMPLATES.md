-  
-  

**Constraints / non-negotiables:**

-  

## 2) Current-State Diagnostic (template)

### A) System map (today)
Describe the flow: idea → prioritization → build → launch → measurement → iteration.

**Where work enters the system:**  
**Where decisions happen:**  
**Where it slows down:**  
**Where it loops (rework):**  

### B) Bottlenecks + root mechanisms (top 5)
1) Symptom:  
   - Mechanism (why it happens):  
   - Evidence/examples:  
2)  

### C) Feature-team reinforcement points
List the mechanisms that force feature delivery (e.g., annual commitments, output metrics, centralized requirements).
-  

### D) Capability gaps (what’s missing)
| Capability | Current maturity (low/med/high) | Evidence | What would “good” look like |
|---|---|---|---|
| Discovery |  |  |  |
| Product strategy |  |  |  |
| Decision making |  |  |  |
| Data/insights |  |  |  |
| Technical platform |  |  |  |

### E) Resistance map
| Stakeholder group | Likely concerns | What they need to believe | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

## 3) Target Product Operating Model Blueprint (template)

### A) Team model
**Team types:** (product teams, platform teams, enabling teams)  
**Ownership model:** (by product area, journey, segment, platform)  

| Team | Mission/outcomes | Interfaces | Key dependencies | Key metrics |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

### B) Roles + expectations
Define expectations for leaders and teams (PM, EM/TL, Design, Data, Exec sponsor).

### C) Decision rights (Day 1)
| Decision | DRI (decider) | Consulted | Guardrails | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Priorities within a product area |  |  |  |  |
| Customer problem selection |  |  |  |  |
| Launch/go-live |  |  |  |  |

### D) Cadences + core artifacts
**Cadences:** (weekly/monthly/quarterly)  
**Core artifacts:** (problem brief, discovery plan, decision log, experiment log, roadmap narrative)

## 4) Pilot / Nudge Plan (90 days) (template)

### A) Pilot selection
**Candidate areas:**  
**Selection criteria:** high leverage, willing leadership, manageable dependencies, safe-to-try.  

### B) Pilot plan (repeat per pilot)
**Pilot name:**  
**Hypothesis:** (If we do X, then Y improves because Z.)  
**Scope:** (team(s), surface area, timebox)  
**Enablement:** (coaching/training/templates/rituals)  
**Nudges:** (defaults, checklists, lightweight rules)  
**Success metrics:** (leading indicators + outcome proxy)  
**Risks + mitigations:**  
**Decision at end:** scale / iterate / stop  

### C) Learning loop
How insights from pilots update the target operating model and roadmap.

## 5) Transformation Roadmap (6–12 months) (template)

| Phase | Timeframe | Objectives | Key changes (“big rocks”) | Dependencies | Milestones |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0: Prep |  |  |  |  |  |
| 1: Pilot |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2: Scale |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3: Institutionalize |  |  |  |  |  |

## 6) Change + Comms Plan (template)

### A) Stakeholder map
| Stakeholder | Influence | Current stance | Key concerns | Ask |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

### B) Narrative + messages
**Core narrative (short):**  
**What’s changing (and why):**  
**What’s not changing (yet):**  
**What teams can expect next (timeline):**  

### C) Enablement plan
Training, coaching, templates, office hours, community of practice.

### D) Reinforcement mechanisms
Rituals, metrics, leadership behaviors, reward systems.

## 7) Governance + Metrics (template)

### A) Leading indicators dashboard
Pick 6–10 indicators across discovery, delivery, decision speed, and outcomes.

### B) Governance cadence
**Weekly:**  
**Monthly:**  
**Quarterly:**  

### C) Guardrails (“framework hygiene”)
What is mandatory vs optional. What’s explicitly not required.

### D) Escalation + rollback
Escalation path for blocked decisions; rollback triggers for high-risk changes.
