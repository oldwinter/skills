## 1) Outcome clarity (0–2)
- **0:** Goals are vague or framed as framework/process adoption.
- **1:** Goals are stated, but not measurable or behavior-linked.
- **2:** Goals are outcome + behavior based, with clear metrics and non-goals.

## 2) Diagnostic specificity (0–2)
- **0:** No system map; mostly opinions.
- **1:** Some bottlenecks listed, limited mechanisms/evidence.
- **2:** System map + concrete bottlenecks with mechanisms and examples.

## 3) Context-fit (framework hygiene) (0–2)
- **0:** Copies a popular model wholesale.
- **1:** Tailored in parts, but still framework-led.

## 4) Target operating model concreteness (0–2)
- **0:** Aspirational statements only.
- **1:** Some roles/cadences defined; decision rights unclear.
- **2:** Decision rights, cadences, and required artifacts are explicit and observable.

## 5) Pilot quality (0–2)
- **0:** No pilots or pilots are big-bang.
