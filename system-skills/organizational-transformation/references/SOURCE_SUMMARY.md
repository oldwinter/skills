# Source Summary — Organizational Transformation

This skill pack was generated from `sources/refound/raw/organizational-transformation/SKILL.md` (Leadership category).

## What was in the source (high-level)

The source contained two primary insights from product leadership voices:

1) **John Cutler — “Frameworks are not the goal.”**  
   The source emphasized “nudging” legacy/non-Silicon Valley companies toward modern product practices in a way that avoids systemic rejection.

2) **Marty Cagan — “Transformation requires techniques.”**  
   The source referenced shifting from a **feature team** model to a **product operating model**, involving structural, cultural, and process change beyond team building.

Note: the extracted source text appears truncated at the end, but the core intent is preserved in the transformation rules + deliverables below.

## How the insights were converted into an execution contract

- **Insight → Rule:** Framework adoption is never the goal.  
  **Check:** Charter and deliverables describe success as outcomes/behaviors + metrics.  
  **Artifact:** Transformation Charter + “framework hygiene” guardrails.

- **Insight → Rule:** Use nudge-first, adoptable change (avoid rejection).  
  **Check:** Plan includes pilots, enablement, nudges, and reinforcement mechanisms.  
  **Artifact:** Pilot/Nudge Plan + Change & Comms Plan.

- **Insight → Rule:** Transformation is structural + cultural + process.  
  **Check:** Target operating model specifies decision rights, cadences, artifacts, and governance.  
  **Artifact:** Target Product Operating Model Blueprint + Governance & Metrics.
