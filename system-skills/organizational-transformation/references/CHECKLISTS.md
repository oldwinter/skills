# Checklists — Organizational Transformation

Use these before finalizing the pack.

## 1) Charter checklist
- Goals are outcomes/behaviors (not “adopt framework X”).
- Non-goals are explicit (reduces fear + scope creep).
- Success metrics include leading indicators (not only lagging outcomes).
- Constraints/non-negotiables are listed.
- Assumptions/unknowns are labeled.

## 2) Diagnostic checklist
- Includes a concrete idea→ship system map (how decisions actually happen).
- Identifies top bottlenecks with mechanisms + evidence (not vague culture statements).
- Names feature-team reinforcement points (incentives/cadences/approvals).
- Includes a resistance map with mitigations.

## 3) Target operating model checklist
- Team types + ownership model are explicit.
- Decision rights table exists for Day 1 (DRI, consulted, guardrails).
- Cadences and required artifacts are specified.
- Expectations include leadership behaviors (not just team behavior).

## 4) Pilot/nudge plan checklist
- 2–4 pilots, each timeboxed with hypotheses and success measures.
- Pilots are safe-to-try and reversible; risks/mitigations listed.
- Enablement + nudges are concrete (templates, rituals, coaching).
- Learning loop updates the model/roadmap.

## 5) Roadmap checklist
- Phases, big rocks, dependencies, and milestones are explicit.
- Protects business continuity; includes decision points and rollback triggers.
- Resourcing plan is realistic (doesn’t assume infinite capacity).

## 6) Change + comms checklist
- Stakeholder map includes stance/concerns/asks.
- Messages include what changes, what doesn’t, and what happens next.
- Reinforcement mechanisms exist (rituals, metrics, leadership behaviors).

## 7) Governance + metrics checklist
- 6–10 leading indicators span discovery, delivery, decision speed, and outcomes.
- Review cadence and escalation paths are defined.
- “Framework hygiene” guardrails prevent cargo-cult adoption.

## 8) Final pack checklist (required)
- Risks, Open questions, Next steps included.
- Rubric scored (see [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md)) and score is acceptable.
