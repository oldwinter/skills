# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance and decision heuristics.

## Step 1 — Intake + constraints
Output a **Context snapshot** (bullets):
- Product today + target customer segment(s)
- Horizon (5–10 years unless specified)
- Mission / executive intent
- Constraints (must-not-break)
- Stakeholders to align + decision-making forum
- Why now (market/tech/user shift)

## Step 2 — Problem anchor (ground the vision)
Write a problem anchor that includes:
- Target customer + context
- The “potent problem” (pain or unmet aspiration)
- What success looks like for the customer (not for the company)
- Current alternatives (status quo and competitors)

Heuristic: if the problem could be true for “anyone”, it’s not potent enough yet.

## Step 3 — Vision options (future states)
Generate 2–3 future states. Each must be:
- **Lofty:** emotionally compelling; implies a big change.
- **Realistic:** plausible within the horizon given constraints.
- **Tech-agnostic:** describes outcomes/experience, not implementation.
- **Problem-grounded:** clearly anchored to the potent user problem.

Avoid future states that are just: “We will use AI to ___.” Replace with: “Users will be able to ___, reliably, because ___.”

## Step 4 — Vision statement + narrative (tagline vs vision)
Use the “what does that mean?” test:
- If a leader says the vision out loud and you ask “what does that mean?”, they should be able to elaborate on:
  - Who the future customers are
  - What is materially different about the value delivered
  - What users can do in the future they can’t do today
  - What tradeoffs are implied

If the statement can’t be elaborated, it’s a tagline, not a vision.

## Step 5 — Pillars + principles (make it actionable)
Write 3–5 pillars that:
- Describe *what must be true* for the vision to exist
- Imply investment decisions (and therefore tradeoffs)
- Can be used to evaluate roadmap items (“does this strengthen a pillar?”)

Optional: add experience principles (especially important for content/workflow products):
- “Help users act on the core value” is often more decision-useful than “be delightful”.

## Step 6 — Strategy bridge (forces choice)
Vision is not a plan. Strategy is the bridge.

Translate pillars into:
- **Strategic choices:** where you will focus scarce resources (3–5)
- **Non-goals:** explicit no’s (3–7) that prevent “everything is priority”
- **Near-term wedge/form factor:** the “sugar” that delivers immediate utility while progressing the long-term “broccoli” vision

Heuristic: if you can’t name non-goals, you don’t have a strategy yet.

## Step 7 — Align + iterate (create shared meaning)
Create a rollout plan:
- A 60–90 minute review session agenda
- The single source of truth (doc location + owner)
- Feedback capture method (inline comments vs structured form)
- Decision rule for disputes (who decides; what evidence matters)

Aim: stakeholders can agree/disagree based on shared definitions, not vibes.

## Step 8 — Quality gate + finalize
Before finalizing:
- Run [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md)
- Score with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md)
- Add **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**

If score is low, fix the lowest categories first (usually: problem clarity, concreteness, and strategic choices/non-goals).
