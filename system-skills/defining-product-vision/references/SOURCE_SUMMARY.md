# Source summary (from Refound/Lenny skill)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/defining-product-vision/SKILL.md`

The original skill is insight-heavy (quotes + brief “apply this by” bullets). This pack converts those insights into an execution contract with concrete deliverables and quality gates.

## Preserved insights → rules, checks, artifacts

### Vision is not a tagline (Melissa Perri)
- **Rule:** A vision must be elaboratable into a concrete 5–10 year future state (not a vague slogan).
- **Check:** Run the “what does that mean?” elaboration test in [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md).
- **Artifact:** Vision narrative + problem anchor + pillars that specify future customers and what’s different.

### Strong visions are lofty, realistic, tech-agnostic, and problem-grounded (Ebi Atawodi)
- **Rule:** Every draft vision must pass the 4-point test.
- **Check:** Use [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) section “A) Vision quality checklist”.
- **Artifact:** Vision options + chosen vision narrative framed as outcomes/experience.

### Center on the core value, and the experience that helps users act (Alex Hardimen)
- **Rule:** Vision pillars should emphasize the core value and the experience principles that enable users to act on it.
- **Check:** Pillars imply decisions (invest in / say no to) and are user-outcome oriented.
- **Artifact:** Pillars table + optional experience principles.

### Strategy bridges mission/vision to planning and forces choice (Chandra Janakiraman)
- **Rule:** The vision pack must include an explicit strategy bridge: choices + non-goals.
- **Check:** At least 3 non-goals exist; choices reflect scarce-resource tradeoffs.
- **Artifact:** Strategy bridge section (choices, non-goals, implications).

### Package radical vision in a familiar form factor (“sugar” + “broccoli”) (Ivan Zhao)
- **Rule:** Identify a mainstream form factor and near-term wedge that delivers immediate utility while moving toward the long-term vision.
- **Check:** Wedge is plausible and clearly connected to the long-term future state.
- **Artifact:** Strategy bridge includes wedge/form factor subsection.

## What was not available
- The original skill references `references/guest-insights.md` for deeper quotes from 101 guests; that file was not present in the provided source folder. This pack therefore preserves and operationalizes the top insights included in the provided `SKILL.md`.
