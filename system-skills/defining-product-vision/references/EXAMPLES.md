# Examples (Prompts + Expected Outputs)

Use these as smoke tests. A good response produces concrete artifacts using the templates in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md).

## Example 1 — B2B SaaS (workflow platform)
**Prompt:**  
“Use `defining-product-vision`. We’re a workflow automation platform for IT and Security teams. Problem: complex approvals and fragmented tooling slow down releases and increase risk. Horizon: 5–7 years. Constraints: compliance-first; do not degrade reliability or auditability. Output: a Product Vision Pack.”

**Expected output:**  
A Product Vision Pack with:
- Context snapshot (bullets)
- Problem anchor (clear, user-centered)
- Vision statement + narrative that describes a concrete future state (not “be the backbone of IT”)
- 3–5 pillars (e.g., policy-native automation, trustworthy change management, cross-tool orchestration)
- Strategy bridge with explicit choices and non-goals (e.g., no consumer workflow tooling) + near-term wedge (a familiar “change management” form factor)
- Rollout plan (stakeholders: Eng, Security, Sales, Legal) + Risks/Open questions/Next steps

## Example 2 — Consumer (personal finance)
**Prompt:**  
“Use `defining-product-vision`. We’re a budgeting app that wants to become a ‘financial operating system’ for young professionals. Horizon: 10 years. Constraints: privacy-first; avoid predatory monetization. Output: a Product Vision Pack plus 2–3 wedge options.”

**Expected output:**  
A Product Vision Pack that:
- Grounds the vision in a potent user problem (financial anxiety, decision overload)
- Stays tech-agnostic (outcomes, not “AI agents will…”) while still being ambitious
- Includes wedge options in familiar form factors (budgeting, bill management, financial calendar, “money autopilot”) and connects each to the long-term future state

## Boundary example — Marketing tagline request
**Prompt:**  
“Write a tagline for our product vision.”

**Expected response:**  
Clarify scope: this skill produces product vision artifacts, not marketing copy. Ask whether to (a) produce a vision pack first, then distill a tagline, or (b) switch to a marketing/copywriting skill.
