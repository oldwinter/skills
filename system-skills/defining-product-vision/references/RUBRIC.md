# Rubric (Score the Pack)

Score each category **0–2** and sum. Use the notes to decide what to fix.

Scale:
- **0 = Missing / unacceptable**
- **1 = Partial / unclear**
- **2 = Strong / clear / decision-ready**

## Scoring table

| Category | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Problem anchor clarity | | | |
| Future state concreteness (not vague) | | | |
| Lofty + realistic balance | | | |
| Tech-agnostic framing | | | |
| Decision usefulness (tie-breaker) | | | |
| Pillars imply choices | | | |
| Strategy bridge (choices + non-goals) | | | |
| Wedge/form factor plausibility | | | |
| Rollout/alignment readiness | | | |
| Risks/open questions/next steps quality | | | |

## Interpretation
- **18–20:** Strong. Ready to share and align.
- **14–17:** Usable but has gaps; fix the lowest-scoring categories.
- **<14:** Not decision-ready; revisit problem anchor, concreteness, and strategic choices/non-goals.
