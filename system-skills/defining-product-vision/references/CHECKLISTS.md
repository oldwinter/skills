# Checklists (Quality Gates)

Use these checklists before finalizing the Product Vision Pack.

## A) Vision quality checklist (the “4-point test”)
The vision is:
- **Lofty:** exciting and direction-setting (not incremental)
- **Realistic:** plausible within the stated horizon and constraints
- **Tech-agnostic:** describes outcomes/experience, not implementation details
- **Problem-grounded:** explicitly anchored to a potent user problem

## B) Tagline vs vision checklist (“what does that mean?”)
If you ask “what does that mean?”, the vision can be elaborated with:
- Future customers (who are they and what changed?)
- Future value difference (how is life/work different?)
- Concrete new capabilities/experience (tech-agnostic)
- Tradeoffs (what we will prioritize and deprioritize)

If it can’t be elaborated, it’s a tagline.

## C) Pillars checklist
- 3–5 pillars, each stated as an outcome/attribute that must be true
- Each pillar clearly ties back to the problem anchor
- Each pillar implies at least one “invest in” and one “say no to”
- Optional principles are behaviorally specific (not “be delightful”)

## D) Strategy bridge checklist (forces choice)
- 3–5 strategic choices (where scarce resources go)
- 3–7 explicit non-goals (prevents “everything is priority”)
- Wedge/form factor articulated (immediate utility + path to long-term vision)
- Tradeoffs are explicit (who is out of scope; what won’t be built)

## E) Rollout checklist (alignment readiness)
- Clear doc owner + single source of truth
- Planned review forum (workshop agenda + attendees)
- Decision tie-breakers named (at least 3)
- Feedback + iteration cadence defined

## F) Final pack checklist (shareable as-is)
- Includes all deliverables listed in `../SKILL.md`
- Uses plain language; minimal jargon
- Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**
