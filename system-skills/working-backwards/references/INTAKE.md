# Intake (Question Bank)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**, then proceed. If answers remain missing, state assumptions explicitly and offer 2–3 options (PR variants, scope, rollout).

## Minimum set (use first)
1) What product + primary customer/user segment is this for?
2) What is the customer problem (or top symptoms) and **why now**?
3) What decision are we making (invest vs not, which approach, what launch tier/by when) and who is the DRI/approver?
4) What constraints are non-negotiable (platform, policy/legal/privacy, dependencies, time/headcount)?
5) What does success look like (1–3 metrics) and what guardrails matter (trust, quality, cost, latency, support load)?

## Helpful follow-ups (pick what’s relevant)

### Alternatives + evidence
- What do customers do today (workarounds, competitors, “do nothing”)?
- What evidence do we have (quotes, data, tickets)? What are we assuming?
- What is the “value moment” the customer gets when this works?

### Launch + GTM “machinery”
- Target launch tiers (internal → beta → GA) and target dates?
- What must be ready at launch: docs, support, sales enablement, marketing site, billing, analytics?
- Which stakeholders/teams can block or constrain this (security, legal, compliance, finance, marketplace ops)?

### Scope boundaries
- What is explicitly out of scope for v1?
- What are the top 3 risky edge cases or abuse/failure modes?
- What dependencies are required and what happens if they slip?

### Packaging + monetization (if relevant)
- Pricing/packaging assumptions? (If unknown, propose 2–3 options.)
- Enterprise requirements: SSO, audit logs, permissions, data retention?
