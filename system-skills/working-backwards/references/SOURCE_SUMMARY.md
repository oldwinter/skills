# Source summary (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/working-backwards/SKILL.md`

The source skill is insight-heavy and focuses on **customer obsession**, avoiding solution-first thinking, and using “working backwards” to align not just a document but the full organizational plan to ship.

The excerpt provided includes 5 guest insights (the original mentions more; the referenced deep-dive file is not present in the raw source folder).

## Preserved insights → execution rules

### 1) Don’t retrofit a problem to a solution (Ian McAllister)
- **Rule:** Write the “Problem today” paragraph before describing the solution; treat existing ideas as hypotheses.
- **Check:** The problem paragraph is coherent even if the solution section is removed.
- **Artifact:** PR “Problem today” section + alternatives bullets ([TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md)).

### 2) Start with what’s best for the customer (Bill Carr)

- **Artifact:** PR headline/summary + metrics section ([TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md)).

### 3) Working backwards includes GTM machinery and stakeholders (Anuj Rathi)

- **Check:** The pack includes owners, dependencies, and launch tiers/rollback.
- **Artifact:** Backcasting plan + stakeholder plan templates ([TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md)).

### 4) Backcasting enables radical futures (Christopher Lochhead)
- **Rule:** Start from a specific future state (release date + customer outcome), then reverse-engineer what must be true.
- **Check:** The PR reads like it shipped; the backcasting plan connects the narrative to milestones.
- **Artifact:** Future press release + milestone plan ([TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md)).

### 5) Future-state planning clarifies impact (Daniel Lereya)
- **Rule:** Describe how the customer’s life is different in a defined horizon (quarter/year) and work backward to priorities.
- **Check:** The PR/FAQ identifies what changes for the customer and what must be built/decided to make that real.
- **Artifact:** PR summary + FAQ scope boundaries ([TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md)).
