# Examples

**Example 1 (Org/process):** “Our on-call load keeps rising and teams are burned out. Map the system and propose leverage points.”  
Expected: an actors/incentives map (teams, incidents, incentives), feedback loops (firefighting loop), effects ledger for candidate changes, and an intervention plan with guardrails.

**Example 2 (Product ecosystem):** “We’re changing API pricing; what are the second-order effects across partners and customer segments?”  
Expected: system boundary + actors map (customers/partners/internal), loops and delays, effects ledger, and a sequencing/mitigation plan.

**Boundary example:** “Write a status update about this week’s tasks.”  
Response: this skill is for complex systems/decisions. Suggest a project update format instead; only use this skill if there’s a systemic pattern to diagnose.
