# Source summary (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/systems-thinking/SKILL.md`

Category: **Leadership**

## What was preserved
The original skill is “insight-heavy” and emphasizes:
- **Managing complex ecosystems** and anticipating **second/third/fourth-order effects** (Hari Srinivasan).
- Converting recurring manual pain into a **system** (process, automation, framework) to improve outcomes (Melissa Perri + Denise Tilles).
- “Seeing the system”: the invisible rules, culture, and interoperability that determine success (Seth Godin).
- Multi-agent trade-offs: map **players and incentives** and how they interact (Sriram and Aarthi).
- **Second-order thinking**: how today’s decisions constrain tomorrow’s options (Nickey Skarstad).

## Gaps / assumptions introduced
- The source mentions “6 insights” but the provided file contains **5** insight sections; this skill pack treats those 5 sections as the canonical input.
- The source references `references/guest-insights.md`, but it was not present in the raw source folder; this pack therefore includes its own templates/checklists rather than guest-by-guest notes.

## How insights were converted into an execution contract
Each insight was turned into:
- A concrete artifact (system boundary, incentives map, feedback loops, effects ledger)
- A workflow step that produces that artifact
- A quality gate (checklists + rubric + risks/open questions/next steps)
