# Templates (Copy/Paste)

Use these templates to produce the **Systems Thinking Pack**.

## 1) Context + System boundary
- Focal decision/problem:
- Desired outcome:
- Time horizon:
- In scope:
- Explicit non-scope:
- Constraints/guardrails:
- Primary outcome metric(s):
- Leading indicators (3–7):
- What has been tried already:

## 2) Actors & incentives map
| Actor / player | Incentives (optimizes for) | Constraints | Power / levers | Likely behavior | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

## 3) System map (variables + causal links)
List 8–15 key variables:
- V1:
- V2:

Then capture causal links:
| From (cause) | Direction | To (effect) | Time delay? | Evidence / confidence | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| A | + / - | B | none / short / long | low / med / high | |

## 4) Feedback loops
Describe 2–6 loops:

### Loop L1 (R/B): <name>
- Links involved:
- Pattern over time:
- Why it happens:
- What would weaken/strengthen it:

## 5) Second-/third-order effects ledger (top 1–3 moves)
| Candidate move | 1st order (immediate) | 2nd order (responses/adaptations) | 3rd order (long-term constraints/norms) | Who wins/loses | Mitigations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

## 6) Leverage points + intervention plan
| Leverage point | Intervention | Owner | Sequence (now/next/later) | Leading indicator(s) | Guardrail(s) | Rollback/stop condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | |

## 7) System-build opportunities (automation/standardization)
Use this to convert recurring pain into a reusable system.

| Recurring pain | Frequency | Root driver hypothesis | Proposed “system” (process/tool/automation) | First small step | Risks | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | |
