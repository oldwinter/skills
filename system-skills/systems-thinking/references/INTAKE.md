# Intake (Question Bank)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**, then proceed with explicit assumptions if answers aren’t available.

## A) Focal problem + decision
1) What is the focal decision you’re considering (or the problem you want diagnosed) in 1–2 sentences?
2) What does “success” look like, and by when (time horizon)?
3) What are the non-negotiable constraints/guardrails (trust, safety, compliance, budget, headcount)?

## B) System boundary
4) What’s in scope vs explicitly out of scope? (Teams, geos, customer segments, partners.)
5) What upstream/downstream systems interact with this (platforms, policies, pricing, support, sales, supply chain)?

## C) Actors + incentives
6) Who are the key actors/players (internal teams, users, buyers, partners, regulators, vendors)?
7) What does each actor optimize for (incentives), and what constrains them?
8) Where are incentives misaligned or in conflict?

## D) Current dynamics (what’s happening today)
9) What has been tried already, and what happened?
10) What are the symptoms you see repeatedly? Any seasonality or time delays?
11) What metrics/leading indicators do you trust (even if imperfect)?

## E) Decision options + risk tolerance
12) What are the top 1–3 candidate moves you’re considering?
13) Which risks are acceptable vs unacceptable? (What must not happen?)
14) How reversible is the decision (two-way vs one-way door)?
