# Checklists

Use this checklist before finalizing the Systems Thinking Pack.

## A) Boundary + clarity
- [ ] The focal decision/problem is stated in 1–2 sentences (not a solution).
- [ ] Goal, horizon, in-scope, and explicit non-scope are clear.
- [ ] Success measures include at least 1 outcome metric and 3+ leading indicators.
- [ ] Constraints/guardrails are explicit (what must not break).

## B) Actor + incentive realism
- [ ] All major actors/players are listed (including partners/policies/culture if relevant).
- [ ] Incentives and constraints are plausible (not wishful).
- [ ] At least one incentive conflict/misalignment is identified.

## C) System map quality
- [ ] Variables are concrete and observable (no undefined abstractions).
- [ ] Causal links are directional and testable.
- [ ] Time delays are noted where they matter.
- [ ] At least 2 feedback loops are extracted (R and/or B).

## D) Second-/third-order thinking
- [ ] Effects ledger covers the top 1–3 candidate moves.
- [ ] Each move includes at least one unintended consequence.
- [ ] Each move includes at least one mitigation and a guardrail metric.

## E) Interventions that can ship
- [ ] 3–7 leverage points are named and tied to the loops/effects.
- [ ] Each intervention has an owner and sequencing (now/next/later).
- [ ] Each intervention includes leading indicators and rollback/stop conditions.
- [ ] Includes at least one “build a system” opportunity for recurring pain.

## F) Communication readiness
- [ ] A stakeholder who wasn’t in the room can understand the map and actions.
- [ ] Trade-offs are explicit (who benefits, who pays).
- [ ] Final section includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.
