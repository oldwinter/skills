# Expanded Workflow (Writing Job Descriptions)

Use this when you need more guidance than `SKILL.md` provides.

## Principles (what makes a JD “high-signal”)
1) **Outcome-first:** start with what changes in 12 months, not a list of tasks.
2) **Spikes, not soup:** define the 1–3 capabilities that truly matter (major/minor).
3) **Progress over bureaucracy:** responsibilities should describe progress and ownership, not meeting attendance.
4) **Honest filtering:** tell the truth about constraints (pace, ambiguity, rigor) so candidates can self-select.
5) **Iterate like a product:** a JD is a living document; improve it based on candidate conversations.

## Suggested workflow (7 steps)

### Step 1 — Intake and “public vs private”
Goal: avoid writing a perfect JD for the wrong role.
- Decide what can be published vs internal-only.
- Capture constraints that affect candidate fit: time zones, travel, on-call, in-office days, pace, ambiguity.

### Step 2 — Create the role scorecard (12 months later)
Goal: make the role measurable and screenable.
- Write 3–6 outcomes that describe business impact and shipped/owned artifacts.
- Prefer “verbs + objects + impact”: “Reduce X from A→B”, “Ship Y that enables Z”.
- Add 2–5 leading indicators (optional) and a 30/60/90 sketch (optional).

### Step 3 — Define competency spikes (major/minor)
Goal: avoid “want everything” hiring.
- Pick 1 major spike and 1–2 minor spikes.
- For each spike: define what “strong” looks like (examples) and what “weak” looks like (anti-signals).
- Add “evidence” hints (portfolio, narratives, shipped systems, references).

### Step 4 — Convert outcomes to responsibilities
Goal: remove arbitrary lists.
- For each 12-month outcome, add 1–2 responsibilities that describe ownership.
- Cap at 6–10 responsibilities total.
- Move “nice-to-have” tasks into a short “You might also…” section (optional).

### Step 5 — Add truth + filters (polarizing clarity, safely)
Goal: the JD should repel the wrong candidates.
- Create a “How we work” section that is candid and specific (cadences, ambiguity, decision-making, pace).
- Add “Who will thrive” and “Who should not apply” sections focused on **work preferences and role fit**, not identity traits.

Examples of safe, specific truth statements:
- “You’ll often work from problem statements, not detailed specs.”
- “We ship weekly and expect you to own outcomes, not just tasks.”
- “This role involves being on-call for incidents ~1 week/month.” (if true)

Avoid:
- “Young”, “native”, “digital native”, “rockstar”, “must work long hours”, or any protected-class proxy language.

### Step 6 — Draft the public JD (skimmable)
Goal: a qualified candidate should understand the role in <2 minutes.
- Use clear headings and bullets.
- Separate **must-haves** vs **nice-to-haves**.
- Keep requirements tight; reduce “years of experience” unless truly necessary.
- If sharing compensation is possible/required, include a range and note how leveling works.

### Step 7 — Iterate (treat it like a product)
Goal: improve the JD based on real signal.
- Add an iteration trigger: “review after 10–15 screens or 20 applicants”.
- Track what’s failing:
  - Low volume → opening paragraphs and distribution, not more requirements
  - Wrong fit → spikes, filters, and “what’s hard here”
  - Misaligned expectations → 12-month success section and constraints
- Keep a version log with what changed and why.
