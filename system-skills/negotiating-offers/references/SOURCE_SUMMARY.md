# Source Summary (What was preserved)

This skill pack was derived from the Refound/Lenny skill `sources/refound/raw/negotiating-offers/SKILL.md`.

## Core insights preserved → execution rules

### 1) Negotiate for the ability to succeed (before/alongside comp)
- Preserved idea: before focusing on personal compensation, negotiate for **resources and organizational commitments** needed to hit the role’s outcomes.
- Turned into: **Success Conditions & Resourcing Asks** deliverable + hiring-manager agenda questions + verification methods.

### 2) Money/title can be a surrogate for other needs (optimize for experiences if that’s your goal)
- Preserved idea: candidates often want respect, learning, or growth; compensation is sometimes a proxy.
- Turned into: **Features vs Experiences** tradeoff matrix and negotiable “experience levers” (mentorship, autonomy, learning budget) with concrete commitments.

### 3) Alternative structures can unlock flexibility (contract/part-time as a bridge)
- Preserved idea: employers may be more open than expected to a **contract** or reduced-schedule arrangement if the proposal is specific.
- Turned into: **Alternative Structure Proposal** template with scope, trial period, and employer risk-reduction framing.
