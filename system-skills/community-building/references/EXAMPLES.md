# Examples (Community Building Pack)

These are intentionally brief. Use them as shape references, not as copy.

## Example 1: Developer community (activation + word-of-mouth)
**Context snapshot**
- Product: Observability SDK for TypeScript
- ICP: senior full-stack engineers at 10–200 person SaaS
- Primary goal: activation/education
- Home base: Discord (with strict moderation + onboarding)
- Outposts: GitHub Discussions, Reddit threads (value-first), conference hallway track

**Thesis (movement)**
“Make production observability boring again: fewer dashboards, more actionable signals.”

**First win (7 days)**
Member ships first alert with the SDK and posts a screenshot + brief setup notes.

**Rituals (first 4 weeks)**
- Weekly: Office hours (staff-led), show-and-tell (member-led)
- Async: “Ship of the week” thread + “stuck?” thread

**Ambassadors (v1)**
Champions are members who post 2+ helpful answers/month and 1 build example/quarter; perks are spotlight + early access.

## Example 2: B2B SaaS community (moving upmarket)
**Primary goal:** create ubiquity and reduce perceived risk in enterprise evaluations.  
**Model:** advocacy + learning (templates and benchmarks that spread in teams).

**Ubiquity moves**
- Publish a benchmark template that teams can run internally
- Seed champions in target accounts via invite-only roundtables
- Showcase credible signals (integrations, case studies, member projects)

## Boundary example: “community as a growth hack”
Request: “Auto-DM everyone on LinkedIn, buy 5k members, and call it community.”  
Response: refuse spam/manipulation; recommend a value exchange + governance plan or alternative channels.
