# Workflow Notes (Community Building)

This file expands the SKILL workflow with decision rules and default moves that keep the output executable.

## 1) Default deliverable shape
Unless the user requests otherwise, produce a **Community Building Pack** with:
- A clear primary goal (pick 1) and a 30/60/90 plan
- A home base + outposts plan (go where members already are)
- A 4–8 week programming calendar with rituals
- A lightweight ambassador/champions program (optional)
- Governance + measurement cadence

If the user only wants a quick start, produce:
- 2-week seeding plan + 2-week programming calendar
- Home base setup + onboarding flow

## 2) Community goal → model mapping (pick one primary)
Use this mapping to avoid trying to do everything:
- **Support deflection:** support/community forum + “answer engine” rituals (office hours, troubleshooting threads)
- **Activation/education:** learning community (cohorts, workshops, show-and-tell)
- **Retention/engagement:** identity + rituals + peer-to-peer networking
- **Advocacy/UGC/referrals:** champions program + showcases + recognition systems
- **Product feedback/co-creation:** beta circles, RFCs, structured feedback rituals
- **Moving upmarket:** credibility movement + internal champions + ubiquity in the category

## 3) Movement rule (Matt Mullenweg)
Don’t build “a chat room for a product.” Build a movement:
- Define a worldview/philosophy (what you believe).
- Name the enemy (the problem or status quo you oppose).
- Define member identity (who belongs).
- Provide a “belief ladder” (what members come to believe over time).

If you can’t write a thesis in 2 sentences, your community positioning is not ready.

## 4) Go-where-they-are rule (Claire Butler)
Platform selection is a downstream choice. First:
- List the top 5 places members already gather.
- Identify 10–25 “nodes” (influencers, community admins, high-trust connectors).
- Decide whether you need a **home base** now or can start with outposts first.

**Default:** pick one home base, but maintain 2–4 outposts for discovery and routing.

## 5) Emerging-category support layer (Elena Verna)
If the category is new or confusing, community must provide:
- Peer examples (“show what you built”)
- Help and troubleshooting
- A shared language and norms

Default rituals:
- Weekly show-and-tell
- Monthly AMA with a respected practitioner
- “Getting started” office hours

## 6) Value-first in existing communities (Meltem Kuran)
If you’re contributing in other communities:
- Provide genuine answers, templates, or help.
- Avoid drive-by links. Route back only when clearly helpful.
- Track repeated questions and convert them into starter resources in your home base.

Anti-pattern: “growth hacks” that burn trust.

## 7) Ubiquity → enterprise de-risking (Camille Ricketts)
If “moving upmarket” is the goal, design for ubiquity:
- Seed champions inside target accounts/roles.
- Create shareable artifacts (templates, benchmarks, playbooks) that spread in teams.
- Highlight credible signals (case studies, integrations, community projects).

Good-enough proxy metrics:
- Number of champion accounts
- Mentions/share-of-voice in target spaces
- Repeat attendance by senior roles

## 8) Programming design: bias to member-generated content
A healthy community cannot be 100% staff-led.
Default weekly mix (adapt to capacity):
- 1 staff-led ritual (office hours / AMA)
- 1 member-led slot (show-and-tell / lightning talks)
- 2–3 async prompts (weekly thread, wins, questions)

Make it easy to contribute:
- Provide prompts, templates, and “starter roles” (welcome squad, curators).

## 9) Ambassador/champions program: keep it ethical and lightweight
Incentives should reward helpfulness and creation, not spam:
- Recognition (spotlight, badges, access)
- Opportunities (speaking slots, early access, co-marketing)
- Light perks (swag, credits) only if they don’t distort behavior

Minimum viable program:
- Clear eligibility criteria
- Simple responsibilities
- Monthly check-in
- Offboarding and enforcement

## 10) Governance + safety defaults
At minimum, define:
- Code of conduct
- What content is not allowed
- Moderator roles and escalation ladder
- Privacy norms (recordings, screenshots, PII)

If moderation capacity is near-zero, prefer lower-risk formats (newsletter + events) over open chat.
