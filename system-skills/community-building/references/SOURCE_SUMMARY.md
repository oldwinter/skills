## What was preserved (core insights → executable rules)

### 1) Ubiquity enables moving upmarket (Camille Ricketts)
- **Insight preserved:** Community-led growth can create ubiquity and de-risk enterprise adoption.
- **Rule in this pack:** If “moving upmarket” is the goal, design for ubiquity (champions, shareable artifacts, credible signals).
- **Where implemented:** `references/WORKFLOW.md` (“Ubiquity → enterprise de-risking”) + SKILL workflow step 3/8.

### 2) Go where the community already lives (Claire Butler)
- **Insight preserved:** Find where the community already gathers and map influence patterns.
- **Rule in this pack:** Choose a home base after mapping where members already are; maintain outposts and an influencer shortlist.
- **Where implemented:** SKILL workflow step 4 + `references/TEMPLATES.md` (platform + influencer tables).

### 3) Community as a support layer and distribution amplifier (Elena Verna)
- **Insight preserved:** In emerging categories, community helps users explore capabilities and amplifies word-of-mouth.
- **Rule in this pack:** Default to peer examples + help rituals (show-and-tell, office hours) when categories are new/complex.
- **Where implemented:** `references/WORKFLOW.md` (“Emerging-category support layer”) + SKILL workflow steps 5–6.

### 4) Build a movement, not just a product group (Matt Mullenweg)
- **Insight preserved:** Strong communities are built around philosophy/worldview.
- **Rule in this pack:** Every community needs a thesis (movement), identity, and “enemy/problem.”
- **Where implemented:** SKILL workflow step 2 + `references/CHECKLISTS.md` (movement checklist).

### 5) Provide genuine value in existing communities (Meltem Kuran)
- **Insight preserved:** Early growth comes from helping in places where people are actively seeking answers.
- **Rule in this pack:** Value-first contributions in outposts; avoid spam; convert repeated questions into starter resources.
- **Where implemented:** `references/WORKFLOW.md` (“Value-first in existing communities”) + SKILL workflow step 4.
