# INTAKE (question bank)

Use this when converting a Refound/Lenny skill into an executable skill pack and key details are missing.

## Ask (max 3–5 questions per round)

### Source + context
- What is the exact source input? (local path to `SKILL.md` / `page.html`, or paste text)
- What is the target persona/role? (PM, founder, recruiter, engineer, marketer, etc.)
- What is the real-world job to be done? (one sentence)

### Output contract
- What artifacts must the agent deliver? (files or structured outputs; list 3–10)
- Where should the agent write outputs (if file output is allowed)? (path + naming conventions)
- Any required formats? (Markdown, tables, JSON schema, emails, slides outline, etc.)

### Scope + boundaries
- What is explicitly out of scope? (what you do NOT want)
- What adjacent skills/processes should this NOT overlap with?
- What constraints exist? (time, budget, org size, industry, stage)

### Safety + constraints
- Any privacy/compliance constraints? (PII, PHI, confidential data, policy)
- Tool constraints for the agent? (read-only vs file writes; network allowed; shell allowed)
- Any “one-way door” actions that require explicit confirmation?

### Quality bar
- Who is the audience/reviewer? (exec, IC, cross-functional)
- What does “good” look like? (3–8 acceptance criteria)

## If answers are missing

Proceed with explicit assumptions:
- Provide 2–3 reasonable default artifact bundles (lite/standard/deep).
- Pick a conservative workflow with explicit checklists/rubrics.
- Flag risks/open questions and propose next steps to resolve uncertainty.
