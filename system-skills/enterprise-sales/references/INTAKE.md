# Enterprise Sales — Intake (question bank)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## A) Deal context
1) What is the product in one sentence, and what measurable business outcome does it drive?
2) What account are we selling to (industry, size), and what is the primary use case?
3) What is the target ACV/package and desired start date (or deadline)?
4) Where are we in the deal right now (stage) and what is the single biggest blocker?

## B) Stakeholders + buying committee
5) Who is the champion candidate, and what do they personally care about (KPIs/career risk)?
6) Who is the economic buyer (who owns budget and says “yes”)?
7) Who are the likely reviewers/approvers (IT/security, legal, procurement, finance, end users)?
8) Are there “preferred vendor” or “use the existing tool” dynamics we need to overcome?

## C) Decision + timeline
9) What decision do they need to make, and by when (decision meeting/date)?
10) If they do nothing for 3–6 months, what gets worse (time/$/risk/missed goals)?

## D) POC/pilot (if requested)
11) Are they asking for a POC/pilot? What are they trying to prove?
12) What would count as a “successful pilot” (metrics + evidence + stakeholders aligned)?
13) What data/integration/access is required, and who will provide it (buyer vs seller)?
14) Is a paid pilot/POC acceptable (and if not, what seriousness filters can we use)?

## E) Procurement + legal
15) What is their procurement process (steps, portals/forms, typical timeline)?
16) What agreements do they require (MSA, DPA, SOW, security addendum), and any non-negotiables?
17) Who signs on their side, and what is the internal approval chain?

## F) Security review
18) What security artifacts do they require (SOC 2/ISO, pen test, architecture, subprocessor list, DPA)?
19) What is the security review process and expected timeline (and who owns it)?

## G) Product-led signals (optional)
20) Is there existing usage at the account (teams/users/events) that supports an “escalation” story?
21) What is the escalator from individual/team value to org-level value (governance, rollout, compliance)?
