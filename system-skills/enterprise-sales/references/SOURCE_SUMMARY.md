# Source Summary — enterprise-sales (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/enterprise-sales/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill covered
The source skill is a collection of tactical enterprise sales insights (enterprise deals, procurement, security review, champions, and POCs/pilots). It highlights that many enterprise deals are lost to **“no decision”**, that procurement requires sellers to do substantial administrative work, and that POCs should be structured to create a **business case**.

Note: the source references a deeper file (`references/guest-insights.md`) that is not present in the local raw source directory. This skill pack preserves the insights available in the source and adds missing execution layers.

## Top insights preserved and how they were transformed

1) **Many qualified deals end in “closed lost — no decision” (Matt Dixon)**  
Preserved as: Step 4 (Decision enablement + MAP) in `../SKILL.md`, and checklist **D** + rubric category **4**.

2) **Procurement requires the seller to do the paperwork; make their job easy (Jen Abel)**  
Preserved as: Step 6 (Procurement + security execution) in `../SKILL.md`, and templates for pre-filling forms in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md).

3) **Product-led sales converts self-serve usage into enterprise opportunity (Elena Verna)**  
Preserved as: “Covers” + “When to use” triggers in `../SKILL.md`, plus intake questions on usage signals in [INTAKE.md](INTAKE.md).

4) **The champion is the key persona in complex buying committees (April Dunford)**  
Preserved as: Step 2 (Buying committee map + champion) and Step 3 (Champion enablement kit) in `../SKILL.md`, and checklist **B/C**.

5) **POCs should be framed as business-case creation; consider charging for POCs (Madhavan Ramanujam)**  
Preserved as: Step 5 (POC/pilot as business case + ROI) in `../SKILL.md`, and checklist **E** + rubric category **5**.

## Notes on additions (manufactured execution layers)
The source skill is insight-heavy and light on executable process. This skill pack adds:
- A clear input/output contract and deliverables list
- A 7-step workflow with checks (inputs → actions → outputs → checks)
- Copy/paste templates (MAP, champion kit, ROI model, procurement/security tracker)
- Quality gates (checklists + rubric) and required final sections (risks/questions/next steps)
