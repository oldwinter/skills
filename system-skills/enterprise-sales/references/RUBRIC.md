# Enterprise Sales — Scoring Rubric (1–5)

Score each category from **1 (weak)** to **5 (excellent)**. A “ship-ready” pack is typically **4+** across categories, with no critical 1–2s.

## 1) Deal clarity + enterprise fit
**1:** Vague deal; no account/use case; unclear stage/timeline/ACV.  
**3:** Account and timeline exist; some assumptions remain.  
**5:** Clear deal snapshot with explicit timeline, success definition, and top stall risk.

## 2) Buying committee map + champion plan
**1:** No committee map; champion not identified.  
**3:** Map exists; champion candidate identified; next actions partial.  
**5:** Complete map with goals/risks/evidence needs; champion plan is actionable and time-bound.

## 3) Champion enablement kit quality
**1:** Generic materials; not forwardable; missing stakeholder views.  
**3:** Some one-pagers and FAQs; limited tailoring.  
**5:** Forwardable memo + tailored one-pagers + crisp objection answers; champion can use immediately.

## 4) Decision enablement (“no decision” prevention)
**1:** Relies on persuasion; no MAP; next steps vague.  
**3:** MAP exists; decision criteria partly defined; “do nothing” not quantified.  
**5:** Do-nothing cost is explicit; decision guide + MAP with buyer commitments and a decision date.

## 5) POC/pilot design as business case
**1:** POC is a feature test; success criteria unclear.  
**3:** Metrics exist; ROI rough; decision criteria partial.  
**5:** 30-day pilot produces a decision-ready business case with measurable metrics, ROI model, and decision criteria/date.

## 6) Procurement + security execution plan
**1:** Hand-wavy; no owners/dates; security/procurement treated as “waiting.”  
**3:** Tracker exists; some owners/dates; missing packet index or comms cadence.  
**5:** Clear tracker with owners/dates/blockers, security packet index, and proactive form-filling/comms plan.

## 7) Close-to-implementation readiness + completeness
**1:** Stops at signature; missing risks/questions/next steps.  
**3:** Some implementation planning; next steps exist.  
**5:** Signature plan + kickoff + first value milestone; explicit Risks/Open questions/Next steps; assumptions labeled with validation plan.
