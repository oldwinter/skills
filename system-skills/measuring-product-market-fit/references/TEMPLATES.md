## 1) Context snapshot

**Product:**
**Stage:** pre-PMF / early PMF / growth / mature  
**Business model:** B2B / B2C / marketplace (side: demand / supply)  
**Decision this informs:**  
**Deadline/timebox:**  
**Audience:**  
**Key segments to evaluate:**  
**Constraints (PII/tools/internal-only):**

## 2) PMF measurement model

**Core value moment (definition):**  
**Active user (inclusion rule):**  
**Primary segment/ICP hypothesis:**  

### Signal set (triangulation)
| Signal | Metric definition | Target / heuristic | Data source | Limitation / bias |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sean Ellis “very disappointed” | % Very disappointed among active users | ~40% in target segment (directional) | Survey | Survivorship/channel bias |
| Retention | Cohort retention over time | Flattening/stable for core cohort | Analytics | Instrumentation gaps |
| Engagement | Core action frequency | Matches product cadence | Analytics | Seasonality |
| Advocacy / references | # willing to vouch | B2B: 6–8; B2C: 15–25 (directional) | CS/sales/reviews | Skewed to power users |

## 3) Sean Ellis PMF survey (instrument + plan)

### Survey questions (standard)
1) “How would you feel if you could no longer use <product>?”
   - Very disappointed
   - Somewhat disappointed
   - Not disappointed
2) “What is the primary benefit you receive from <product>?” (text)
3) (Optional) “What type of people do you think would benefit most from <product>?” (text)
4) (Optional segmentation) Role / company size / use case / tenure / plan tier

### Distribution plan
**Population definition (active users):**  
**Channel:** in-app / email / other  
**Sample size target (overall + by segment):**  
**Fielding window:**  
**Incentive (if any):**  
**Bias risks + mitigation:**  

### Results table (overall + by segment)
| Segment | n | Very disappointed | Somewhat | Not | Top benefit themes (short) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Overall |  |  |  |  |  |
| Segment A |  |  |  |  |  |
| Segment B |  |  |  |  |  |

## 4) Behavioral evidence (retention + engagement)

### Definitions
**Cohort start event:** (signup / activation / first value)  
**Retention event:** (core action)  
**Cadence expectation:** daily / weekly / monthly  

### Retention summary
| Segment | Cohort window | Retention metric | Curve shape summary | Notes / confounders |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Overall |  |  |  |  |
| Segment A |  |  |  |  |

### Instrumentation gaps (and impact)
- Gap:
  - Impact on conclusions:
  - Fix (fastest instrumentation change):

## 5) Reference-customer / advocacy evidence log

| Customer/user | Segment | Evidence type (testimonial/case study/reference call/review) | Primary benefit (verbatim) | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

Heuristic targets (directional):
- B2B: 6–8 references
- B2C: 15–25 strong advocates

## 6) PMF scorecard (final)

### PMF status (by segment)
| Segment | PMF status (No / Partial / Strong / At-risk) | Confidence (H/M/L) | Why (1–3 bullets) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall |  |  |  |
| Segment A |  |  |  |
| Segment B |  |  |  |

### Evidence scorecard
| Signal | Current | Target / heuristic | Confidence | Evidence / notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Very disappointed % |  |  |  |  |
| Retention |  |  |  |  |
| Engagement |  |  |  |  |
| References |  |  |  |  |

## 7) Action plan (next 30–90 days)

### Top actions (prioritized)
| Priority | Action | Segment | Hypothesis (mechanism) | Leading indicator | Lagging indicator | Owner (if known) | Timebox |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Measurement cadence + drift triggers
**Cadence:** (e.g., quarterly survey; monthly cohort review)  
**Drift triggers:** (conversion drop %, churn change, usage down, competitor shifts)
