# Rubric (Score 1–5)

Score the PMF Measurement Pack across dimensions. Use scores to decide whether to ship/share as-is or iterate.

## 1) Decision usefulness
1 = No decision; mostly descriptive  
3 = Decision is named but implications are fuzzy  
5 = Clear decision + clear “what we’ll do differently” based on outcomes

## 2) Segment clarity
1 = “All users” with no segmentation  
3 = Some segmentation but weak definitions  
5 = Crisp segment definitions; conclusions are segment-specific

## 3) Evidence quality (triangulation)
1 = Single weak signal; no counts; no limitations  
3 = Multiple signals but gaps/limitations not addressed  
5 = Survey + behavior + advocacy evidence; limitations explicit; confidence justified

## 4) Survey rigor (Sean Ellis)
1 = Ad hoc survey; unclear population; no “benefit” synthesis  
3 = Standard questions used; some bias acknowledged  
5 = Standard questions; explicit sampling; segment results; benefit themes; bias risks + mitigations

## 5) Behavioral rigor (retention/engagement)
1 = Vanity metrics only; unclear definitions  
3 = Retention/engagement included but confounders not addressed  
5 = Correct cohort definitions; cadence-aware interpretation; confounders + instrumentation gaps addressed

## 6) Actionability
1 = Vague recommendations (“improve onboarding”)  
3 = Some actions but weak metrics/owners  
5 = Prioritized actions with hypotheses, leading/lagging indicators, and timeboxes

## 7) Completeness + hygiene
1 = Missing required sections; unclear assumptions  
3 = Mostly complete; assumptions partially noted  
5 = Complete pack; assumptions explicit; includes Risks/Open questions/Next steps

### Interpretation (suggested)
- **28–35:** Strong; share broadly; execute action plan.
- **20–27:** Good directional; tighten weak areas before high-stakes decisions.
- **<20:** Rework inputs/definitions; evidence too thin or unclear.
