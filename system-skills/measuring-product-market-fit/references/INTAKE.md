# Intake (Question Bank)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**, then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## A) Decision + constraints
1) What decision will this PMF measurement support (scale spend, launch, narrow ICP, reposition, pricing, pause growth)?
2) What’s the deadline/timebox and who is the audience (execs, product, growth, investors)?
3) Any constraints: privacy/PII, internal-only vs shareable, tools/data access limits?

## B) Product + value definition
4) What is the product and the primary job-to-be-done it helps with?
5) What is the **core value moment** (the action that indicates value received)?
6) How do you define an **active user** (e.g., used in last 7/30 days; completed core action)?

## C) Segments / ICP
7) What is your current best ICP/segment hypothesis (who gets the most value today)?
8) What segments matter for decisions (persona, company size, industry, use case, geography, platform, plan tier)?
9) Are you B2B, B2C, or a marketplace? If marketplace: which side is the “hard side” today?

## D) Data availability (behavioral)
10) What product analytics do you have (events, activation funnel, cohorts, retention dashboards)?
11) What retention proxy is most relevant: user retention, logo retention, revenue retention, repeat purchase, weekly active usage?
12) What is your current best estimate of retention/usage frequency by cohort (even if rough)?

## E) Data availability (survey + qualitative)
13) Can you survey active users? If yes: where (in-app, email, SMS) and what sample size is realistic?
14) Do you have existing qualitative evidence (interviews, support tickets, sales calls, reviews)?
15) What are the top 3 “must-have” benefits users cite today (your best guess)?

## F) Advocacy / reference signals
16) Do you have customers willing to be references or provide testimonials today? Rough count?
17) Are there any constraints on public references (enterprise policies, compliance)?

## G) Market change / PMF drift
18) Has the market changed materially in the last 6–12 months (economy, regulations, competitors, platform shifts)?
19) What leading indicators suggest drift (conversion drop, churn uptick, usage down, support volume up)?

## Fast-start defaults (if answers are missing)
- Assume 2–3 primary segments and define them explicitly.
- Assume “active user” = used product in last 30 days and performed the core action at least once.
- If no analytics exist, rely on survey + qualitative evidence and label confidence as **low** until instrumentation improves.
