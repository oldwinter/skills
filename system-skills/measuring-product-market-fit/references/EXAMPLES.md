# Examples (Expanded)

These examples are longer than the ones in `../SKILL.md` and are meant as inspiration for prompting and expected outputs.

## Example 1 — B2B SaaS (finding PMF by segment)
**Prompt**
“Use `measuring-product-market-fit`. Product: SOC2 compliance automation for startups. Stage: early PMF. Segments: founders doing it themselves vs compliance leads at 200–500 employee companies. Data: 6-month cohorts, onboarding funnel, and in-app survey. Decision: whether to double down on founders vs move upmarket. Output: a PMF Measurement Pack.”

**What “good” looks like**
- A segment-by-segment survey result table with “very disappointed” %, plus benefit themes.
- A retention summary that uses a cadence-appropriate metric (e.g., weekly key actions, not DAU).
- A diagnosis that identifies the strongest segment, and a clear “narrow ICP” recommendation if appropriate.

## Example 2 — Consumer product (PMF drift)
**Prompt**
“We had strong PMF for our language learning app, but engagement is down after a competitor launched. Diagnose whether we’re losing PMF, and propose drift triggers + a measurement cadence. Output a PMF Measurement Pack.”

**What “good” looks like**
- Explicit “At-risk” diagnosis with evidence (cohort shift + survey shifts + qualitative reasons).
- Concrete actions (e.g., improve core value moment, repositioning, retention experiments) with measurable indicators.

## Boundary example — Pre-activation product
**Prompt**
“Do we have PMF? We have 2k signups and 50 actives.”

**Expected response**
- Explain why PMF measurement is premature without a stable active cohort.
- Propose an activation-focused plan (define core value moment; instrument; run a smaller directional survey on activated users only).
