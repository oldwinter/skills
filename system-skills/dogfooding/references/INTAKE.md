# Intake (Dogfooding)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What is the product and target user persona?** (who uses it; what job it helps them do)
2) **What are the 1–3 core workflows to dogfood end-to-end?** (start → done outcome)
3) **What time box + cadence do you want?** (e.g., 1 week, 2 weeks; 20 min/day; weekly triage)
4) **Who will participate and what is the expected time commitment?** Include “creator commitments” if relevant (publish weekly, run reports, etc.).
5) **What environment should we use and what constraints apply?** (prod vs staging; data/privacy; access; compliance; customer data handling)

## Helpful details (as needed)
- What’s broken right now (top complaints)? Any known pain points or hypotheses?
- What tools do you use to track issues/decisions? (Jira/Linear/GitHub/Notion/Sheets)
- Do you want the output as a single combined pack or separate artifacts?
- What is the “ship gate” you want? (e.g., “scenario A completes in <10 min with no workarounds”)

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A default **2-week** dogfooding sprint with **20 min/day** per participant + **weekly triage**
- 5 core scenarios derived from the product summary (explicit assumptions)
- A conservative environment plan (prefer staging; avoid real customer data)
- A dogfooding log schema + severity scale + a weekly report template
