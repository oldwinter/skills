# Source summary

## Source
- `sources/refound/raw/dogfooding/SKILL.md`

The provided Refound skill contains two guest insights (quotes). This skill pack preserves those insights and operationalizes them into an executable dogfooding program with contracts, workflow, templates, checklists, and rubric.

## Preserved insights → rules/checks

### 1) Teams should “be the user” (especially for creator products)
From Maya Prohovnik: the team needed to create podcasts to truly understand pain points.

- **Rule:** If the product is for creators, define a **creator commitment** (publish cadence + done definition) and treat it as part of the workflow.
- **Check:** Did participants produce a real artifact end-to-end (publish/share) and log friction with evidence?
- **Artifact:** Scenario map + routine plan + weekly report sections for “creator commitments”.

### 2) Intense daily use creates realism (don’t ship what you wouldn’t use)
From Michael Truell: intense daily dogfooding was the core engine; they didn’t want to ship anything not useful to them.

- **Rule:** Run **time-boxed daily** dogfooding sessions focused on completing scenarios end-to-end; add a **scenario-based ship gate**.
- **Check:** Can the team complete the core scenario(s) with no hidden workarounds in the chosen environment?
- **Artifact:** Dogfooding log + triage decisions + verified fixes list.
