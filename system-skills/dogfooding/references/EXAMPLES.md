# Examples

**Example 1 (Creator product):** “We’re building a podcast creation tool. Create a dogfooding program where the whole team publishes 1 short episode/week, and produce a weekly report template.”  
Expected: scenarios from “idea → published episode”, creator commitments, log schema, triage cadence, and ship gate tied to publishing.

**Example 2 (B2B workflow product):** “Set up a 2-week dogfooding sprint for our AI meeting notes tool focused on ‘record → summary → share → action items’.”  
Expected: scenario map, daily routine, severity scale, triage rules, weekly report, and a verified-fixes list.

**Boundary example:** “Dogfood this idea we haven’t built yet.”  
Response: dogfooding requires a usable artifact; propose discovery + prototype/usability testing first, then a dogfooding sprint once there’s something to run end-to-end.
