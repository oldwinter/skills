# Rubric (Score 1–5)

Score the draft across these dimensions. A “ship-ready” pack is typically **≥24/30** and no category below **3**.

## 1) Scope clarity (1–5)
- 1: Vague goals; missing why now; scope boundaries unclear.
- 3: Goals/non-goals exist; constraints listed; some assumptions unclear.
- 5: Crisp decision framing; explicit tradeoffs; assumptions/dependencies are audit-friendly.

## 2) Diagram usefulness (1–5)
- 1: No diagram or overly detailed UI mock notes; moving pieces unclear.
- 3: Diagram exists but missing key hand-offs/states.
- 5: ≤10 moving pieces; makes feasibility and responsibilities obvious; supports build planning.

## 3) Flows + state coverage (1–5)
- 1: Only a happy path; missing error/empty/loading and edge cases.
- 3: Main edge cases captured; some states ambiguous.
- 5: Role-playable flows; critical states defined; edge cases have intended outcomes.

## 4) Prototype plan quality (1–5)
- 1: Prototype is vague or not tied to a decision.
- 3: Timeboxed and scoped but realism or criteria are weak.
- 5: Clear decision; right fidelity; realistic data; success criteria measurable; disposable-by-default code stance.

## 5) Testability (requirements + acceptance criteria) (1–5)
- 1: Requirements are aspirational; no acceptance criteria.
- 3: Some acceptance criteria; gaps in non-functional requirements.
- 5: Falsifiable requirements; must/should/could; acceptance criteria cover edge cases and constraints.

## 6) Measurement + risk management (1–5)
- 1: No metrics; no risks/open questions.
- 3: Metrics exist but instrumentation/owners unclear; risks generic.
- 5: Metrics map to data/events and owners; guardrails defined; risks/open questions/next steps are actionable.
