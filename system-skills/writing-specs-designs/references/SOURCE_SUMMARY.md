# Source summary (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/writing-specs-designs/SKILL.md`

What was preserved (translated into executable rules):
- **Attention is scarce (esp. mobile):** treat taps as expensive; optimize the critical path.
- **Spec output should be a diagram:** a low-fidelity drawing that aligns product/design/engineering on the moving pieces.
- **Prototype for “feel”:** static mocks can’t validate interaction quality; prefer high-fidelity prototypes when needed.
- **Rough sketches accelerate alignment:** “draw badly” to invite collaboration and corrections.
- **Real software prototypes can be fastest:** throwaway code prototypes can reveal truth earlier than static walkthroughs.

What was added to make this agent-executable:
- Input/output contracts and a step-by-step workflow.
- Templates for spec/design docs, diagrams, flow/state tables, tap economy, and prototype briefs.
- Quality gates: checklists + rubric, and required Risks/Open questions/Next steps.
