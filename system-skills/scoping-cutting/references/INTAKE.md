# Intake (Scoping & Cutting)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and list the **Open questions** that would change the cut decisions.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What are we shipping (and for whom)?** Product + target user/segment + core job/journey.
2) **What’s the appetite/time budget or ship date?** (e.g., 2/4/6 weeks) Who is the DRI/decision owner?
3) **What outcome matters?** Success metric(s) + 2–5 guardrails (trust, quality, cost, latency, support load).
4) **What constraints are non-negotiable?** (privacy/legal, platform, dependencies, integrations, brand, reliability)
5) **What’s the candidate scope list today?** Bullets are fine. What are the top unknowns/risks?

## If “MVP” is the ask (hypothesis-first)
- What hypothesis are we testing? What must be true for this to be worth building?
- What is the fastest way to validate it (prototype / concierge / Wizard-of-Oz / scripted demo)?
- What would invalidate the idea (clear failure criteria)?

## If “cut scope” is the ask (trade-offs)
- What must ship vs would be “nice”?
- What edge cases can we defer safely? What is the cost of deferring them?
- What scope is being requested “just in case”? What evidence supports needing it now?

## If “scope creep” is the ask (change control)
- Who is requesting changes? How often? What’s the decision rule today?
- What is allowed to change mid-stream (if anything)?
- What is the escalation path and who trades off scope vs time?

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A clear **Context snapshot** with labeled assumptions
- 2–3 plausible **MLS options** (smaller → bigger) that fit likely appetites
- A **cut list** with rationale and explicit non-goals
- A minimal **validation plan** for the top assumption(s)
- A short list of **open questions** that would change the decision
