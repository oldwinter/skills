# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → Skill Pack)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/scoping-cutting/SKILL.md`

## What was preserved
Key insights from the source were converted into executable rules, checks, and templates:

- **Appetite-based planning (time as a budget)** → Workflow Step 3 requires an explicit appetite; scope is treated as the variable.
- **MVP as hypothesis validation (not “small product”)** → Workflow Step 2 forces a hypothesis + success/failure criteria and ties scope to learning.
- **Minimum Lovable Product** → MLS section requires a coherent end-to-end flow plus 1–2 “lovability” choices that increase trust/clarity.
- **Wizard-of-Oz validation** → Workflow Step 6 includes a WoZ/concierge validation plan template and checklist.

## Notes / limitations
- The source references “guest insights” that are not present in the repo; this pack was derived from the visible top insights only.
