# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → Agent Skill)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/conducting-user-interviews/SKILL.md`

The original skill is an **insight collection** (tactical advice from 43 product leaders). It contains a small set of highlighted insights and encourages deeper exploration.

This skill pack converts those insights into an **execution contract**: clear scope, input/output contracts, a step-by-step workflow, and reusable templates/checklists.

## Preserved core insights → rules, checks, artifacts

### 1) Build a high-trust, high-speed customer channel
- **Insight (preserved):** A small set of highly engaged customers can provide outsized signal when you respond quickly.
- **Rule:** Maintain an opt-in list of 5–10 engaged users you can reach quickly; close the loop fast.
- **Check:** Do you have named participants + a follow-up cadence? Are you responding within 24–48 hours?
- **Artifact:** Follow-up plan + “customer panel” list (User Interview Pack section F).

### 2) Get the “switch story” (JTBD causation)
- **Insight (preserved):** The most valuable interviews capture the story of why a person switched (what they “fired” and “hired”).
- **Rule:** When the decision involves adoption/churn/alternatives, run a timeline-based switch interview.
- **Check:** Did you capture push/pull/anxieties/habits and the triggering event?
- **Artifact:** JTBD switch interview guide + synthesis table rows tied to forces.

### 3) Recruit for early adopters (plan for rejection)
- **Insight (preserved):** Early adopters are a minority; recruiting requires volume and filtering.
- **Rule:** Plan outreach volume; use a screener; don’t interpret lack of response as product signal.
- **Check:** Is there a realistic outreach-to-interview funnel and clear inclusion criteria?
- **Artifact:** Recruiting plan + screener + outreach copy.

### 4) PM + design should observe (avoid “telephone game” research)
- **Insight (preserved):** Direct observation improves product decisions; delegated summaries dilute learning.
- **Rule:** Ensure PM/design observe live or listen to recordings for key sessions whenever possible.
- **Check:** Are observers named? Is there a debrief step after each interview?
- **Artifact:** Workflow steps 5–6 + debrief template in `references/TEMPLATES.md`.

### 5) Collect stories, not opinions
- **Insight (preserved):** The goal is rich, specific stories grounded in real behavior.
- **Rule:** Default to “last time…” and step-by-step walkthrough questions; minimize hypotheticals.
- **Check:** Are most questions about past behavior? Do notes include verbatims and story moments?
- **Artifact:** Discovery guide + note-taking template + checklist items C/D.
