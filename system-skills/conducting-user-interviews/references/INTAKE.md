# Intake (Conducting User Interviews)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What decision will these interviews inform?** (onboarding redesign, positioning, roadmap bet, churn reduction) By when?
2) **Who is the target participant?** Role, context of use, situation/trigger, and what makes someone a “good fit”.
3) **Which interview type is this?** discovery / JTBD switch / churn / concept test (or “recommend”).
4) **What’s the current alternative?** (spreadsheets, competitor, manual workflow, status quo) and what evidence do we already have?
5) **Constraints:** number of interviews, time box, region/language, recording policy, incentives, and any privacy/legal constraints.

## Logistics + access (as needed)
- Where can we recruit from? (in-product, email list, support tickets, community, sales pipeline, LinkedIn)
- Who should observe? (PM, design, eng, research) Any must-include stakeholders?
- Any existing artifacts? (support logs, churn reasons, past research, analytics dashboards)

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A stated decision hypothesis + success definition
- A participant profile and recruiting plan with 2–3 channels
- A story-first guide (discovery + switch probes) and a notes template
- A synthesis format that avoids over-claiming (confidence labeling)
