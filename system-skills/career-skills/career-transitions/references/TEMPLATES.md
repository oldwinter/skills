### Informational interview request
Subject: Quick question about your work in [area]

Hi [Name] — I’m exploring a possible transition toward [archetype]. I’d love to learn how your role actually works day-to-day and what you’d do if you were starting over.

Would you be open to a 20-minute chat in the next two weeks? If it’s easier, I can send 3 questions by email instead.

Thanks,  
[Your name]

### Follow-up / thank you + one ask
Thanks again for the time today — the part about [specific insight] was especially helpful.

One quick follow-up: is there 1–2 people you’d recommend I talk to next to understand [unknown]?

### Referral-style ask (only after rapport)
I’m planning to apply for [role/team] and wanted to sanity-check fit. If you think I’d be a strong match, would you be comfortable connecting me to the hiring manager or referring me? If not, no worries — any feedback on gaps to address would be hugely helpful.

## 5) Sabbatical / bridge proposal (optional)

Goal: frame as retention + sustainability, not escape.

- Context: I want to continue contributing long-term, but I need a reset to sustain performance.
- Proposal: [X weeks/months] starting [date], returning [date].
- Coverage plan: what’s covered, what pauses, who is backup.
- Return plan: what I’ll focus on in the first 30 days back.
- Decision point: confirm approval by [date]; mid-sabbatical check-in (optional).
