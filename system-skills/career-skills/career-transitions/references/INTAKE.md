# Intake (Career Transitions)

Ask **3–5 questions at a time**. If the user can’t answer, offer multiple-choice options and proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Quick intake (start here)

1) What change are you considering (pivot, new company, new function, industry change, sabbatical, entrepreneurship)?
2) What’s prompting this now (top 2–3 pushes and top 2–3 pulls)?
3) What constraints must remain true (location/remote, hours, money/runway, family, visa, timeline)?
4) What are you optimizing for (learning, autonomy, stability, mission, leadership, comp, flexibility)? Rank top 3.
5) What’s your decision timeline (when you need clarity; earliest start date)?

## Current state snapshot

- Current role/title and scope (team size, what you own, seniority)
- Energy and bandwidth (hours/week available for transition work)
- Risk tolerance (low/medium/high) and why
- What you want to avoid repeating (top 3 “never again” items)

## Progress metric (beyond money)

If you had to pick 1–2 “progress metrics” for the next 12 months, what are they?
- Learning rate / skill acquisition
- Autonomy / decision ownership
- Quality of team / mentorship
- Mission alignment / meaning
- Work-life fit / flexibility
- Stability / predictability
- Compensation (floor + upside)

## Genie goal + backcast prompts

- If success were guaranteed, what would you pursue next?
- What would your 10-year “success story” headline be?
- What’s a 3-year waypoint that would feel like real progress?
- What would you do in the next 12 weeks to move toward it?

## Target archetypes (2–4 options)

For each archetype, clarify:
- Role/function (e.g., PM → PMM; IC → manager; startup → big tech)
- Environment (stage, pace, values, culture, remote/hybrid)
- Dealbreakers / no-gos
- “Fit signals” you can observe in interviews or through your network

## Option scorecard inputs

- What’s the decision rule? (e.g., “choose the path that maximizes learning + autonomy while keeping comp above X and staying remote”)
- What evidence would change your mind?
- What unknowns are biggest? (skills fit, day-to-day reality, hiring market, comp range, manager quality)

## Opportunity pipeline inputs

- Who are 10–30 people you could talk to? (friends, ex-coworkers, mentors, alumni, communities)
- Who are 3–5 “high-performers” you’d love to work with or learn from?
- What communities/spaces overlap with your target archetypes?
- What outreach cadence is realistic weekly?

## Skills & proof inputs

- What are your strongest assets (skills, strengths, domain knowledge)?
- What gaps worry you most for the target archetypes?
- What proof artifacts could you produce quickly? (write-up, project, demo, portfolio, talk)

## Experiments (4–12 weeks)

Pick 2–5 experiments:
- 5–10 informational interviews
- Shadowing / day-in-the-life conversations
- A small project that simulates the work
- Internal transfer exploration
- A sabbatical or reduced-hours proposal
- A short contract/consulting bridge
