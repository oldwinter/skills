# Expanded Workflow: Building a Promotion Case

This file expands the workflow in `SKILL.md` with practical heuristics, rules/checks, and copy/paste building blocks.

## Principles to follow (rules + checks)

### 1) Promotion is an org decision; make it easy
- **Rule:** Your goal is to make “yes” the lowest-risk decision for leadership.
- **Check:** A reader can answer in 60 seconds: *what you did, what changed, why it matters, and why you’re already operating at the next level.*

### 2) Don’t conflate promotion and career
- **Rule:** Promotion is a company-specific leveling mechanism; your career is a longer arc. Align them, but don’t treat promotion as the only signal of progress.
- **Check:** Your doc includes a “target role” and a “job after next” sentence (even if brief).

### 3) Table stakes first, then differentiation
- **Rule:** If you’re not solid in your current job, a promotion case will read as entitlement.
- **Check:** Your evidence log includes “current-level excellence” signals (reliability, follow-through, stakeholder trust), not just stretch work.

### 4) Partner with your manager (Magic Loop)
- **Rule:** Promotions happen fastest when your manager can confidently sponsor you.
- **Check:** You have explicit criteria agreed with your manager and a cadence for check-ins (dates on the calendar).

### 5) Politics is logistics
- **Rule:** Influence isn’t a personality trait; it’s a plan for who needs to believe what and when.
- **Check:** You can name 3–8 stakeholders and what proof each would find credible (metrics, customer evidence, operational excellence, strategy).

## Step-by-step guidance

### Step 2: Promotion thesis (how to write it)
Use this pattern:
- **Ask:** “Promote me to **<target level>**.”
- **Because:** “I already operate at that level by **<next-level behaviors>**.”
- **Proof:** “I delivered **<top 3 impacts>** that advanced **<company priority>**.”
- **Why now:** “Given **<timing/process>**, this is the right cycle because **<recent outcomes + sustained performance>**.”

Avoid:
- “I’ve been here X years…”
- “I worked hard…”
- “I did a lot of tasks…”

### Step 4: Evidence log (what counts as evidence)
Include multiple evidence types:
- **Outcomes:** revenue/cost, retention/activation, adoption, quality, reliability, risk reduced, cycle time improved
- **Scope & leverage:** breadth of ownership, number of teams influenced, reusable systems/processes
- **Leadership signals:** leading ambiguous work, aligning stakeholders, making hard calls, mentoring/coaching
- **Artifacts:** PRDs, strategy docs, decision logs, launch notes, postmortems, dashboards
- **Stakeholder proof:** quotes, written feedback, “would work with again” statements

If metrics are limited:
- Use proxies (cycle time, incident rate, adoption, internal NPS, qualitative customer evidence)
- Use baselines (“before/after” snapshots) even if approximate
- Make assumptions explicit (don’t fake precision)

### Step 5: Promotion doc (structure that’s skimmable)
Aim for:
- **One-pager:** TL;DR + impact highlights + ladder mapping summary
- **Appendix:** deeper evidence, links, quotes, “receipts”

Heuristic:
- Every section should survive an exec skim.
- Claims are bold; evidence is indented or linked.

### Step 6: Manager alignment (Magic Loop scripts)
Use these prompts in a 1:1:
1) “I want to be promoted to **X** by **Y**. What would you need to see to confidently sponsor me?”
2) “If I did one thing this month to make your job easier, what should it be?”
3) “Can we write down 3–5 criteria and set two check-ins before the packet is due?”

Follow-through plan:
- Do what they ask (even if unglamorous), then return with proof and ask for the next step.

### Step 7: Sponsor/visibility plan (how to ask without being awkward)
Good asks are specific and low-effort:
- “Can you share 2–3 bullets on what you saw me do well on **<project>**, especially related to **<competency>**?”
- “Would you be comfortable being listed as a reference for **<promotion packet>**? If yes, here’s a 1-page summary for context.”

Avoid:
- Vague asks (“Can you support me?”)
- Surprise asks right before the deadline
