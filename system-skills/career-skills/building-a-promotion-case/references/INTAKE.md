# Intake (Question Bank)

Use this to gather the minimum information required to produce a Promotion Case Pack. Ask **3–5 questions at a time**.

## 1) Role + target
1) What’s your current role/level and scope (team, product area, what you own end-to-end)?
2) What promotion are you seeking (target level/title), and by when (which cycle/date)?
3) What do you personally want longer-term (your “job after next”), and how does this promotion serve it?

## 2) Company process + ladder
4) Do you have a career ladder / rubric for the target level? If yes, paste an excerpt or summarize the key expectations.
5) What is the promotion process like (manager decision, committee, written packet, peer feedback, calibration)?
6) What is the talent calendar (when are packets due, when are decisions made)?

## 3) Evidence inventory
7) List 3–8 high-signal examples from the last 6–12 months (projects, launches, decisions, incidents, strategy work).
8) For each example: what changed (metrics/outcomes), what was your role, and who were the key partners?
9) What artifacts can you share (PRDs, strategy docs, launch notes, dashboards, decision logs) — even as anonymized summaries?

## 4) Manager alignment + constraints
10) What’s your manager’s current stance (supportive/unclear/resistant)? Any prior feedback on gaps?
11) Any constraints: limited metrics, confidentiality, reorganizations, leadership changes, budget, scope changes?
12) What are 1–3 “table stakes” areas you must be solid on (execution, stakeholder management, strategy, technical depth, etc.)?

## 5) Stakeholders + sponsorship
13) Who are 3–8 stakeholders whose opinion matters (xfn leads, senior leaders, customers, internal users)?
14) Who might sponsor you, and who might be skeptical? Why?
15) Any known politics/risks (comp constraints, headcount freezes, leveling skepticism, visibility issues)?
