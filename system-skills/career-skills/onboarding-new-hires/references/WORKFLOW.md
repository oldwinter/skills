# Workflow Notes (expanded guidance)

Use this file to tailor the skill’s workflow by seniority, environment, and risk profile.

## Core principles (turn “insights” into design rules)

1) **Reduce hidden curriculum**
- Provide an explicit “how we work” doc (context pack) before day 1 when possible.
- Include a glossary and “where truth lives” map (docs, dashboards, decision records).

2) **Belonging first**
- No “sit alone and read docs” first day.
- Assign a **buddy** (navigation + social integration) and a **first pair** (collaborative work partner).

3) **Diagnose before treat**
- In days 0–30, prioritize listening, learning, and relationship building.
- Major changes should be hypothesis-driven and explicitly sequenced (not day-7 reorgs).

4) **Make success legible**
- Define success at 30/60/90 days and at 1-year/2-year horizons.
- Add check-ins and “how we’ll know” metrics.

5) **Working agreement beats assumptions**
- Early “relationship design” prevents misalignment and recurring friction.

## Tailoring: by seniority

### Junior / mid-level IC
- Emphasize role clarity, safe wins, and paired work.
- Shorten the listening tour; deepen the “how we work” + examples.
- Make milestones concrete: tickets shipped, customer calls completed, docs updated.

### Senior IC (Staff+)
- Add explicit decision rights and cross-team interface expectations.
- Expand the listening tour and include architecture/strategy context.
- Bias toward “map the system” + produce a 90-day de-risk plan with stakeholders.

### First-time manager / people leader
- Add team health, performance management basics, and hiring plan context (if relevant).
- Increase the relationship design section: expectations with your manager + with reports.

### Executive / functional leader
- Expand stakeholder map to include exec peers and key external partners.
- Require a 30-day “state of the union” memo and a 60-day alignment plan.
- Define “what not to change yet” guardrails to avoid trust loss.

## Tailoring: remote/hybrid specifics

- Add time-zone friendly routines (async updates, office hours, rotating meeting times).
- Ensure the hire has scheduled “collisions” (1:1s, pairing, team rituals) to avoid isolation.

## Suggested 30/60/90 structure (default)

**Days 0–30 (Listen + Map + De-risk)**
- Build relationships; run listening tour; learn the domain and systems.
- Deliverables: stakeholder map, systems map (if needed), onboarding notes, state-of-the-union draft.

**Days 31–60 (Align + Plan + Early Delivery)**
- Propose focus areas and validate with stakeholders.
- Deliverables: prioritized plan, success metrics, first shipped outcome, decision log.

**Days 61–90 (Execute + Systemize)**
- Drive execution; establish repeatable rituals; hand off ownership cleanly.
- Deliverables: shipped outcomes, operating cadence, team docs updated, next-quarter plan.

## Common failure modes (and how to prevent them)

1) **Over-indexing on docs without relationships**
- Fix: schedule introductions + pairing; measure “relationship coverage” (who they’ve met).

2) **Moving too fast (“solutions before diagnosis”)**
- Fix: require a 0–30 listening tour and a written synthesis before large changes.

3) **Vague success criteria**
- Fix: force measurable milestones and explicit stakeholder sign-off.

4) **No working agreement**
- Fix: hold relationship design conversation in the first 2 weeks; document it.
