# Examples

**Example 1 (typical):** “I’m a mid-level PM. I want a mentor for leadership growth and a sponsor to help me get staffed on higher-visibility work. Build a target list and write outreach messages. Ask me only 5 questions first.”  
Expected: A prioritized list (internal + external), warm paths, and 3 message templates.

**Example 2 (no strong network):** “I moved industries and don’t know many people. Help me find mentors outside my company and build a system to reach out without feeling spammy.”  
Expected: Targeting criteria + community sourcing plan + outreach and follow-up sequence + tracking.

**Boundary example:** “I want you to message 500 people on LinkedIn with the same pitch until someone replies.”  
Response: decline; offer a smaller, personalized approach with ethics/safety constraints and warm-path prioritization.
