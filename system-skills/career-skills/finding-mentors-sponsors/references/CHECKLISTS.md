# Checklists — Finding Mentors & Sponsors

Use these before finalizing the pack.

## A) Inputs checklist
- [ ] Goal is specific and time-bounded (3–6 months).
- [ ] Top 2–4 gaps/problems are concrete (examples included).
- [ ] Constraints are explicit (time/week, confidentiality, internal/external, channels).
- [ ] Assumptions are written down when info is missing.

## B) Mentor portfolio checklist
- [ ] “Mentor” vs “Sponsor” vs “Coach” are clearly distinguished.
- [ ] Portfolio includes multiple roles (not a single perfect mentor).
- [ ] Each portfolio role has a concrete ask and ideal profile.

## C) Target list + warm path checklist
- [ ] 10–25 candidates with a clear priority order.
- [ ] Mix of internal + external (unless user explicitly constrained).
- [ ] At least 50% have a plausible warm path (mutual, community, shared work).
- [ ] Top 5 candidates are high-fit and reachable.

## D) Outreach pack checklist
- [ ] Outreach is personalized (why them).
- [ ] It names a specific gap and includes humility (“I’m learning X / don’t know Y yet”).
- [ ] Ask is small (15–30 minutes) and easy to decline.
- [ ] Includes a follow-up message and a warm intro request template.
- [ ] No mass-spam framing; respectful tone.

## E) First meeting + follow-up checklist
- [ ] 30-minute agenda exists and includes a clear close.
- [ ] Question set is high-signal (not generic “tell me about your career”).
- [ ] Recap template is ready; expectation to close the loop is set.

## F) Relationship OS checklist
- [ ] Cadence is realistic for the user’s capacity.
- [ ] Every relationship has a next touchpoint and next action.
- [ ] Value exchange is explicit (how the user gives back).

## G) Sponsor strategy checklist (if sponsorship included)
- [ ] Sponsor candidates identified with a rationale (“why they might bet”).
- [ ] “Earn → signal → ask” plan is concrete and tied to real work.
- [ ] Sponsor asks are specific (intro/staffing/vouch/visibility), not vague favoritism.

## H) Finalization checklist
- [ ] Pack includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**.
- [ ] First-week plan exists (first 3 outreaches + first 1–2 meetings targeted).
- [ ] Safety: no requests for secrets/credentials; confidentiality boundaries respected.
