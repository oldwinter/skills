# Source Summary (what was preserved and how)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/evaluating-candidates/SKILL.md`

## Preserved core insights → converted into rules/checks/artifacts

1) **Defensiveness is a risk signal (team dynamics)**
- Rule: explicitly evaluate coachingability and reactions to pushback; record evidence.
- Check: do notes include examples of handling disagreement/feedback without deflection?
- Artifact: scorecard criteria + red flag list; reference check question on feedback/defensiveness.

2) **Keep a pulse on the market (bar calibration)**
- Rule: define the bar using explicit benchmarks (internal exemplars or market calibration).
- Check: can you describe what “great” looks like and why, for this role at this stage?
- Artifact: evaluation brief with success outcomes + criteria anchors.

3) **Paid work trials can be high-signal (especially high-agency roles)**
- Rule: prefer job-relevant work samples; use paid trials when scope resembles real work.
- Check: trial has clear timebox, deliverables, and anchored rubric; fairness/IP constraints are respected.
- Artifact: work sample/trial brief + rubric template.

4) **Reference checks can outperform interview signals**
- Rule: run structured reference checks with specific examples and calibration vs peers.
- Check: reference summary includes concrete examples, not generic praise.
- Artifact: reference outreach, script, note form, and summary template.

5) **Value raw ability + drive when appropriate**
- Rule: decide explicitly whether to prioritize raw ability + “hunger to build” vs domain tenure.
- Check: criteria and signal plan match the role reality (pace, ambiguity, ownership).
- Artifact: weighted criteria + signal plan; work sample/trial designed to surface agency and judgment.
