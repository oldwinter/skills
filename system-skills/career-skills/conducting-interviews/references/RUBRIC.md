# Rubric (1–5)

Score the Interview Execution Pack. A strong pack is typically **≥ 22/30** with no category below 3.

## 1) Stage goal clarity (1–5)
- **1:** Unclear purpose; overlaps with other stages; no timeboxes.
- **3:** Purpose is mostly clear but stage responsibilities are still fuzzy.
- **5:** One-sentence goal, crisp boundaries, and realistic timeboxes (including candidate questions).

## 2) Criteria quality (1–5)
- **1:** Criteria are missing or pure “traits/vibes”.
- **3:** Criteria exist but anchors are vague or not observable.
- **5:** 4–8 criteria with clear definitions, strong/weak anchors, and evidence hints.

## 3) Question design (1–5)
- **1:** Generic questions; double-barreled; mostly hypotheticals.
- **3:** Some behavioral questions but mapping/probes are inconsistent.
- **5:** Behavioral-first, one question → one signal, with probing ladders that force specifics.

## 4) Evidence capture + scoring (1–5)
- **1:** No structured notes/scorecard; ratings are impressionistic.
- **3:** Scorecard exists but evidence requirements are weak or inconsistent.
- **5:** Notes + scorecard demand evidence per rating; summary is consistent with criterion scores.

## 5) Substance-over-polish hygiene (1–5)
- **1:** Rewards confidence/structure; penalizes candidates for communication style.
- **3:** Acknowledges the risk but lacks concrete countermeasures.
- **5:** Explicit guardrails to reduce false positives/negatives (specificity tests + question clarification).

## 6) Fairness + candidate experience (1–5)
- **1:** Process feels adversarial; risks inappropriate topics; unclear next steps.
- **3:** Candidate experience is acceptable but inconsistently handled.
- **5:** Clear expectations, respectful close, and fairness hygiene (notes discipline, bias reduction, escalation to HR/legal when needed).
