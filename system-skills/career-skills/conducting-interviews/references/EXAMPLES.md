# Examples

**Example 1 (Screen):** “Create a 30-minute phone screen for a Senior Product Manager. I want to evaluate product sense, execution, and collaboration. Output the Interview Execution Pack with a question map and scorecard.”  
Expected: timeboxed script, behavioral questions, clear anchors, and a scorecard that captures evidence.

**Example 2 (Loop):** “Design a structured interview loop for a Staff Engineer, including a hiring manager interview and a cross-functional panel. Map questions to our values and include a debrief template.”  
Expected: stage goals, consistent criteria across interviewers, and artifacts that make debriefs evidence-based.

**Boundary example:** “Just tell me if this candidate is good; I don’t have criteria or notes.”  
Response: require criteria + evidence; propose default criteria and ask the user to paste notes or run a structured interview first.
