# Intake (Conducting Interviews)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What role are we interviewing for and at what level?** (title, level, function)
2) **Which interview stage(s) are you running/designing?** (screen, hiring manager, panel, onsite) + **duration** per stage.
3) **What criteria should we evaluate?** (4–8 competencies/values). Any “must-have” or “must-not” signals?
4) **What is the role context the candidate should know?** (team mission, what you build, what’s hard, why hire now)
5) **What candidate materials should we probe?** (resume, portfolio, work samples) + any concerns/topics to validate

## Helpful details (as needed)
- Interview format: remote/in-person; number of interviewers; panel order; tooling (Zoom, Greenhouse, Lever, etc.)
- What parts of the process already exist? (question bank, rubric, values, leadership principles)
- What’s currently going wrong? (false positives, inconsistent scoring, bias risk, weak debriefs, poor candidate experience)
- Constraints: time zones, accommodations, confidentiality boundaries, topics you should not discuss

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A **default criteria set** appropriate to the role family (explicitly labeled assumptions)
- A **behavioral-first** question map: 1–2 questions per criterion + probes
- A scorecard with clear anchors and evidence prompts, even if the criteria are later refined
