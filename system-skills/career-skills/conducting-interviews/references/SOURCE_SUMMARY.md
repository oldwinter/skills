# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → Execution Contract)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/conducting-interviews/SKILL.md`

The original skill is insight-heavy (quotes + advice). This pack converts those insights into rules, checks, and concrete artifacts for running structured interviews.

## Preserved insights → rules + artifacts

### 1) “Look past numbered lists; evaluate substance” (Jackie Bavaro)
- **Rule:** Do not equate structured delivery with strong judgment; require evidence and specificity.
- **Artifact:** “Substance-over-polish” guardrails + probing ladders in `references/WORKFLOW.md` and `references/TEMPLATES.md`.
- **Check:** Every criterion rating is backed by concrete evidence (decisions, constraints, outcomes), not presentation quality.

### 2) “How did you prepare?” reveals systems-thinking (Austin Hay)
- **Rule:** Use “How did you prepare for this interview?” as a meta-signal question (especially in screens).
- **Artifact:** Global question section in the Question Map template.
- **Check:** The interview plan explicitly includes (or intentionally omits) this question with rationale.

### 3) Standardize behavioral interviews mapped to values (Bill Carr)
- **Rule:** Use standardized, behavioral questions mapped to objective criteria/values.
- **Artifact:** Criteria table + Question Map + Scorecard templates.
- **Check:** Questions map to criteria; interviewers use consistent anchors across candidates.

### 4) “Is there anything else?” surfaces late-breaking signal (Christopher Lochhead)
- **Rule:** Always end with a low-structure close to allow important information to surface.
- **Artifact:** Mandatory close question in the Interview Plan and Script templates.
- **Check:** The script reserves time for candidate questions and the closing prompt.

### 5) “Why do you want to work here?” tests homework + alignment (Gina Gotthilf)
- **Rule:** Ask “Why here?” to test basic research and mission/role alignment.
- **Artifact:** Global question section in the Question Map template.
- **Check:** The scorecard captures evidence of alignment and understanding (not just enthusiasm).

## Gaps/assumptions
- The provided source SKILL.md includes 5 highlighted insights while referencing “75 product leaders (91 insights)”. This pack implements the available insights and adds execution scaffolding (templates, checklists, rubric) to make the guidance usable in real hiring workflows.
