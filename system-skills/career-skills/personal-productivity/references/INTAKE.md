# Intake — Personal Productivity

Use these questions to gather the minimum information needed to build a timebox plan + capture/to-do system.

## Ask first (pick 3–5)
- What’s your role and what are the 3–5 outcomes you’re responsible for?
- What does a “bad week” look like right now (2–3 concrete examples)?
- What does “better” mean in 2–4 weeks (how will you know this worked)?
- Do you have a calendar you can timebox on (any tool), and do you use a to-do list today (which one)?
- Share either: (a) a representative week (recurring meetings list), or (b) your main constraints (time zones, on-call, travel, caregiving).

## Schedule + constraints
- What are your non-negotiables (sleep, commute, workouts, caregiving, hard stops)?
- What meeting load do you typically have (hours/day; recurring blocks)?
- Do you control your calendar, or do others book you freely?
- Are there “fixed deep work” needs (writing, planning, IC work) and how many hours/week?
- Do you work weekends today? If yes, what’s driving it and what’s your ideal rule?

## Task capture + task volume
- Where do tasks currently land (Slack, email, notes, memory)?
- What kinds of tasks are you dropping (follow-ups, admin, people mgmt, project details)?
- Do you prefer one list or multiple lists (projects/contexts), and why?
- How often are you interrupted with new tasks during the day?

## Preferences + operating style (optional)
- When is your best focus time (morning/afternoon/evening)?
- What’s your tolerance for structure (light vs detailed)?
- What’s one productivity habit that has worked for you in the past?

## If information is missing
- If no calendar is available: draft a default week with conservative focus blocks + meeting windows and label assumptions.
- If no to-do tool is preferred: default to a single inbox + 3 lists (Today / Next / Waiting) with a daily processing ritual.
- If workload is unclear: start with the next 7 days only; avoid “life overhaul” plans.
