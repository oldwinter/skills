# Source Summary — Personal Productivity (Refound/Lenny)

## Source
- `sources/refound/raw/personal-productivity/SKILL.md`

## Core insights preserved
1) **Timeboxing for high-intensity roles:** use explicit blocks to balance a demanding job with additional commitments (e.g., board/advising) by scheduling dedicated windows rather than letting work spill indefinitely.
2) **Write everything down:** externalize memory into a trusted to-do system; capture tasks reliably and use lists/reviews to maintain clarity under high volume.

## How the skill was transformed
- Converted insights into an execution contract that produces a **Weekly Timebox Plan** and a **Capture + To-Do System Spec**, plus daily/weekly rituals and a 7-day rollout.
- Added checks (buffers, meeting windows, single inbox, daily processing ≤15 minutes) to make the system practical and testable.

## Notes / assumptions added
- Assumed a career-focused persona (busy knowledge worker/leader) based on category = Career.
- Kept tooling neutral (works with any calendar + any to-do list) to stay compatible across environments.
