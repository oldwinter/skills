# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → Execution Contract)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/writing-job-descriptions/SKILL.md`

The original skill is insight-heavy (quotes + advice). This pack converts those insights into rules, checks, and concrete artifacts.

## Preserved insights → rules + artifacts

### 1) “Job descriptions are made up… focus on progress” (Bob Moesta)
- **Rule:** Define the role by the progress/outcomes it must create, not an arbitrary task list.
- **Artifact:** Role scorecard + outcome-mapped responsibilities.
- **Check:** Every responsibility maps to at least one 12-month outcome; anything unmapped is removed or re-justified.

### 2) “Major and minor… define spikes” (Lauren Ipsen)
- **Rule:** Pick 1 major spike and 1–2 minors; do not hire for “everything”.
- **Artifact:** Competency spike map (major/minor) with “strong looks like” + evidence.
- **Check:** Spikes are specific, evidence-backed, and linked to 12-month outcomes.

### 3) “Use polarizing language / be transparent about intensity” (Anton Osika)
- **Rule:** Be candid about constraints and pace so candidates self-select; avoid vague hype.
- **Artifact:** “How we work / what’s hard here” + “who will thrive / who won’t” sections.
- **Check:** Statements are specific and role-fit oriented (not identity traits); avoids biased or exclusionary language.

### 4) “Treat the JD like a product; iterate” (Jason Shah)
- **Rule:** Treat the JD as a living document; update it based on candidate conversations and market feedback.
- **Artifact:** Iteration plan + version log with triggers (e.g., review after N applicants/screens).
- **Check:** The pack defines what signal will cause which changes (attract vs filter vs misalignment).

### 5) “12 months later… clinking champagne” (Jonathan Lowenhar)
- **Rule:** Start with success at 12 months and work backward.
- **Artifact:** “Success in 12 months” section + scorecard.
- **Check:** Outcomes are stated in business-impact terms and include evidence/artifacts and (when possible) measurable indicators.

## Gaps/assumptions
- The source references “insights from all 6 guests” but only 5 guests are present in the provided SKILL.md. This pack uses the available insights and adds execution scaffolding (templates, checklists, rubric).
