# Checklists

Use these to validate the Job Description Pack before finalizing.

## A) Role clarity checklist
- [ ] Role title, level, reporting line, and team context are explicit
- [ ] “Why hire now” and the role’s purpose are stated in plain language
- [ ] Public vs internal-only info is clearly separated (no accidental leakage)

## B) 12-month outcomes checklist (scorecard)
- [ ] Includes 3–6 outcomes for **12 months after start**
- [ ] Outcomes describe business impact and owned artifacts (not generic activities)
- [ ] At least 1–2 measurable indicators exist (or are clearly labeled “TBD”)
- [ ] Scope boundaries are explicit (in/out)

## C) Spike specificity checklist (major/minor)
- [ ] Exactly 1 **major** spike and 1–2 **minor** spikes are defined
- [ ] Each spike ties to at least one 12-month outcome
- [ ] “What strong looks like” is concrete (examples), not buzzwords
- [ ] Must-haves vs nice-to-haves are separated (no “must have everything”)

## D) High-signal + filtering checklist
- [ ] Responsibilities are phrased as ownership/progress, not meeting lists
- [ ] “How we work / what’s hard here” is candid and specific
- [ ] “Who will thrive / who should not apply” enables self-selection
- [ ] Filters are about role fit (work preferences, environment), not identity traits

## E) Inclusivity + compliance checklist (non-legal)
- [ ] Avoids biased or exclusionary language (e.g., “rockstar”, “native”, protected-class proxies)
- [ ] Avoids unverifiable hype (“best-in-class”, “once-in-a-lifetime”) unless substantiated
- [ ] Includes (or flags for addition) an EEO / accommodations statement consistent with company policy
- [ ] Location/remote and any required constraints (travel/on-call/clearance) are stated truthfully

## F) Iteration readiness checklist
- [ ] Includes an iteration trigger (review after N applicants/screens)
- [ ] Version log exists with what will change and what signal will drive the change
- [ ] Includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**
