# Examples

**Example 1 (Startup, high-pace):** “Write a job description for a founding Product Designer for a seed-stage B2B AI tool. We need someone who can ship end-to-end in ambiguity. Include success at 12 months and a candid ‘what’s hard here’ section.”  
Expected: clear 12-month outcomes, a design-major spike, honest pace/constraints, and filters that self-select the wrong candidates out.

**Example 2 (Scale-up, specialized spike):** “Create a role scorecard + job posting for a Staff Backend Engineer owning reliability for a high-traffic API. Emphasize systems thinking and incident ownership.”  
Expected: outcome-based responsibilities tied to reliability outcomes, plus a clear major spike (operational excellence) and measurable success criteria.

**Boundary example:** “Write a JD for a ‘rockstar generalist’ to ‘do whatever is needed’ (no outcomes).”  
Response: refuse to invent a laundry list; run intake, define 12-month outcomes and spikes first, then draft.
