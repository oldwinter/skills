# Source Summary (Managing Imposter Syndrome)

## Source
- Refound/Lenny skill: `sources/refound/raw/managing-imposter-syndrome/SKILL.md`
- Primary contributor referenced: **Julie Zhuo**

## What the source emphasized (preserved)
- Imposter feelings often appear in **uncomfortable situations** that coincide with rapid growth.
- Managing imposter syndrome is a **distinct professional skill** (not just a mood), involving vulnerability and reframing.

## What was missing / inferred
The source file provided in-repo is short and partially truncated, so this pack adds a complete execution contract:
- Episode-based pattern mapping (triggers → thoughts → behaviors)
- Confidence vs competence calibration
- Evidence bank (“receipts”) to counter distorted beliefs
- A 2–4 week experiment plan (exposure ladder + feedback loops)
- Support scripts and a maintenance/relapse routine

## How this pack maps insight → artifacts
- “Discomfort can signal growth” → Growth Narrative + Reframe Set
- “Make it a skill” → Repeatable workflow + templates + checklists + rubric
