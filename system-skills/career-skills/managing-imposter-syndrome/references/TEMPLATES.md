- Success criteria (2–4 weeks; observable behaviors):
- Constraints (time, privacy, workload):
- Assumptions/unknowns:

### B) Trigger & Pattern Map
For each trigger:
- Trigger (situation):
- Inner script (automatic thought):
- Emotion/body signal:
- Behavior (avoid/perfect/overwork/silence):
- Cost:
- Distortions likely:
- Gap type (confidence vs competence vs mixed):

### C) Reframe Set + Growth Narrative
- Growth narrative (2–4 sentences):
- Reframes (3–7):
  1) …
  2) …
  3) …
- “If-then” coping plan:
  - If I notice [signal], then I will [reframe] and do [micro-action].

### D) Evidence Bank
| Claim / fear | Evidence for fear | Evidence against fear | Next evidence to gather |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

Also capture “receipts”:
- Wins/outcomes (metrics or proxies):
- Artifacts (docs, launches, decisions):
- Feedback (quotes):
- Skills demonstrated:

### E) Experiment Plan (2–4 weeks)
- Weekly cadence (how many exposures/week):
- Top avoidance loop to target:

| Experiment | Goal | Difficulty (1–5) | Schedule | Pass signal | Debrief question |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

### F) Support Plan + Scripts
- Who to involve (manager/mentor/peer):
- What you need from them (calibration, feedback, reassurance, sponsorship):
- Check-in cadence:

**Manager script (calibration ask)**
Hi [Name] — I’m ramping into [scope] and want to calibrate expectations. For [upcoming situation], what does “good” look like? After I do it, could you give me quick feedback on what worked and what to adjust?

**Peer/mentor script (reality-check)**
I’m noticing a pattern where I interpret uncertainty as “I don’t belong.” Can I share a specific episode and get your read on what’s actually expected and how you’d handle it?

**Boundary script (reduce over-commitment)**
I can take this on, but I’d need to trade off [X]. Which should I deprioritize?

### G) Maintenance + Relapse Plan
- Daily (2 minutes):
- Weekly (10–20 minutes):
- Monthly (optional):

### H) Risks / Open Questions / Next Steps
