# Intake (Question Bank)

Use this to gather the minimum information required to produce an **Offer Negotiation Pack**. Ask **3–5 questions at a time**.

## 1) Offer + role snapshot
1) What role/title/level is the offer for, and who will you report to?
2) Is the offer verbal, written, or still “coming soon”? What’s the decision deadline?
3) Who is your point of contact for negotiation (recruiter vs hiring manager)?

## 2) Offer components (share what you’re comfortable sharing)
4) What are the components: base, bonus, sign-on, equity (type + amount/vesting), benefits, location/remote, start date?
5) Any constraints already stated (comp bands, leveling, remote policy, visa timing, start date)?

## 3) Your priorities (features vs experiences)
6) Rank your top 3 priorities (e.g., cash, equity, title/level, scope, learning, mentorship, autonomy, flexibility, mission).
7) What are your dealbreakers (must-haves) and what are you willing to trade?
8) Are you optimizing for “features” (money/title) or “experiences” (learning/autonomy/mentorship) — and why now?

## 4) BATNA + leverage (no bluffing)
9) What alternatives do you have (other offers/interviews/current role)? (High level is fine.)
10) What’s your timeline/risk tolerance: would you rather accept quickly, or push for a better package even if there’s some risk?

## 5) Success conditions (resources to succeed)
11) What do you believe could block success in this role (tech debt, unclear scope, missing headcount, weak decision rights, stakeholder misalignment)?
12) What resources/commitments would make you confident you can hit the role’s outcomes in 6–12 months?

## 6) Optional: alternative structures
13) Would you consider part-time, contract, or a phased start? If yes, what constraints (days/week, minimum income, benefits needs)?

## 7) Safety/constraints
14) Any sensitive constraints I should avoid (confidential employer info, NDA, numbers you don’t want written down)?
