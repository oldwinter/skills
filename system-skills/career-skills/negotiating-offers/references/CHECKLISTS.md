# Checklists (Quality Gate)

Use these checklists before finalizing an **Offer Negotiation Pack**.

## 1) Scope + safety checklist
- [ ] This is an employment offer negotiation (not legal/tax advice; not vendor/procurement).
- [ ] No secrets requested or stored; user can redact sensitive details.
- [ ] Scripts avoid threats, bluffs, or false claims.
- [ ] If equity/tax/legal details are material, the pack flags “consult a professional.”

## 2) Decision clarity checklist
- [ ] Decision deadline and next meetings are explicit.
- [ ] BATNA is written in plain language and used as a decision rule (not a threat).
- [ ] Must-haves, tradeables, and dealbreakers are clearly separated.

## 3) Success conditions checklist (resources to succeed)
- [ ] At least 3 success-condition asks are listed (if relevant to the role).
- [ ] Each ask is tied to outcomes (OKRs/results) and includes a verification method.
- [ ] Hiring-manager agenda includes questions about expectations, blockers, and authority.

## 4) Offer tradeoffs checklist
- [ ] Offer components are inventoried (cash, equity, role, lifestyle, experience).
- [ ] Tradeoffs are explicit (what you’ll trade to get what you want).
- [ ] The plan avoids “ask for everything”; focuses on a few high-impact levers.

## 5) Ask package + scripts checklist
- [ ] A/B/C packages exist and are internally consistent.
- [ ] Package C is genuinely acceptable (no future resentment).
- [ ] Scripts include: first response, counter framing, and follow-up recap.
- [ ] Next steps are scheduled (who responds by when).

## 6) Final required section
- [ ] **Risks** (3–7 bullets)
- [ ] **Open questions** (3–7 bullets)
- [ ] **Next steps** (3–7 bullets with owners/dates where possible)
