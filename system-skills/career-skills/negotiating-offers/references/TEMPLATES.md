# Templates (Copy/Paste)

Use these templates to produce the **Offer Negotiation Pack**. Keep language concrete, polite, and business-outcome oriented.

## 1) Offer snapshot + timeline

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Company / team | <…> |
| Role / level / manager | <…> |
| Offer status | verbal / written / pending |
| Decision deadline | <date> |
| Negotiation owner | recruiter / hiring manager / both |
| Next meeting(s) | <date/time + who> |
| Notes | <constraints, bands, policy> |

## 2) Goals, priorities, BATNA

### Priorities
- **Must-haves (2–4):** <…>
- **Tradeables (2–6):** <…>
- **Nice-to-haves (2–6):** <…>
- **Dealbreakers:** <…>

### BATNA (high-level)
- If this offer can’t meet <minimums>, I will <accept other offer / stay in current role / keep interviewing>.

### Negotiation posture
- **Risk tolerance:** low / medium / high
- **Style:** collaborative / firm / exploratory

## 3) Success conditions & resourcing asks (negotiate the ability to win)

Use this to negotiate for resources/commitments required to hit outcomes.

| Outcome I’m accountable for | Likely blocker | Ask / commitment | Why it matters | How we verify (in writing) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <e.g., ship X by Y> | <tech debt / missing headcount> | <budget/headcount/authority> | <tie to OKRs> | <role charter / hiring plan / OKR doc / offer addendum / recap email> |

### Hiring-manager questions (agenda)
1) “To be successful in 6–12 months, what outcomes will I be measured on?”
2) “What resources do you expect will be available (headcount, budget, decision rights)?”
3) “What are the biggest blockers today (tech debt, process, org dependencies), and what’s the plan to address them?”
4) “What authority will this role have to make changes if blockers appear?”

## 4) Offer components & tradeoff matrix (features vs experiences)

### Components inventory
List what’s negotiable:
- Cash: base, bonus, sign-on, relocation
- Equity: grant size, type (ISO/NSO/RSU), strike price, vesting cliff, refresh, exercise window
- Role: level/title, scope, team, direct reports, decision rights
- Lifestyle: remote/hybrid, travel, start date, flexibility
- Experience: mentorship, learning budget, conference budget, coaching, project ownership

### Tradeoff matrix
| Lever | Current | Ask | Priority (Must/Trade/Nice) | Rationale | What I’ll trade |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| Base salary | <…> | <… or %> | <…> | <market/impact> | <e.g., sign-on> |
| Equity | <…> | <…> | <…> | <risk/ownership> | <…> |
| Mentorship | <none> | <named mentor + monthly cadence> | <…> | <learning> | <…> |

## 5) A/B/C ask package (make “yes” easier)

### Package A (ideal)
- Compensation: <…>
- Equity: <…>
- Role / success conditions: <…>
- Experience / flexibility: <…>

### Package B (target)
- <…>

### Package C (floor I can accept)
- <…>

### Strategy notes
- **Sequence:** success conditions first / parallel / comp first (choose)
- **Single-threading:** one negotiation thread owner (usually recruiter)
- **Decision rule:** accept if package ≥ C and success conditions are confirmed

## 6) Scripts pack

### A) First response to an offer (email)
Subject: Offer for <Role> — thank you + next steps

Hi <Name> — thank you for the offer. I’m excited about the opportunity and I’d love to talk through a few details so I can make a confident decision.  
Could we schedule <time options> to discuss the offer and a couple role-success questions?

Thanks,  
<Name>

### B) Success-conditions framing (for recruiter or hiring manager)
“I’m very interested. Before we finalize comp, I want to make sure I’m set up to succeed in the role. To deliver <outcomes>, I’ll need clarity on <resources/authority>. Can we talk through what the company can commit to?”

### C) Counteroffer (collaborative, specific)
“Based on <market/level/scope> and what I’d be accountable for, I’m targeting <ask>. If that’s difficult on base, I’m open to exploring <sign-on/equity/level> as alternatives.”

### D) Follow-up recap (after a call)
Subject: Recap — offer discussion for <Role>

Hi <Name> — thanks again for the conversation today. Here’s my understanding of what we discussed:
- **Agreed:** <…>
- **Open items:** <…>
- **Next steps:** <who does what by when>

If I missed anything, please correct me.  
Thanks,  
<Name>

## 7) Optional: alternative structure proposal (contract / part-time)

Use this when flexibility is the main goal and you can define concrete outputs.

### Proposal (fill-in)
- **Structure:** contractor or part-time employee
- **Schedule:** <e.g., 3 days/week>
- **Term:** <e.g., 3 months trial, then extend>
- **Scope / deliverables:** <3–6 bullet outputs>
- **Rate / comp approach:** <hourly/day rate or prorated>
- **Review point:** <date> with decision to convert/extend/end
- **Risk reduction for employer:** clear deliverables, easy exit, defined handoffs

### Ask script
“Would you be open to a <3 days/week> structure for the first <X> months? I can own <deliverables> with clear milestones. It reduces risk on both sides, and we can decide by <date> whether to extend or convert to full-time.”
