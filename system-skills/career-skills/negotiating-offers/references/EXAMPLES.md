# Examples

**Example 1 (resources + comp):** “I got a PM offer from a Series B startup. The role seems under-resourced. Help me negotiate for the right headcount/budget and a better equity package, and draft the recruiter email + hiring-manager agenda.”  
Expected: Offer Negotiation Pack with success-conditions asks and a clear A/B/C package.

**Example 2 (optimize for experiences):** “I have two offers. One pays more, the other has better mentorship and autonomy. Help me compare trade-offs and negotiate for mentorship/training budget without losing the offer.”  
Expected: Tradeoff matrix + experience-focused asks + scripts.

**Boundary example:** “Negotiate a SaaS vendor contract renewal with legal terms and procurement.”  
Response: out of scope; use a procurement/legal negotiation workflow instead.
