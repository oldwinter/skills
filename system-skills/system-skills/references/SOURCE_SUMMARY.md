# Source summary (Refound/Lenny → skill pack)

## Source
- `sources/refound/raw/technical-roadmaps/SKILL.md`
- Primary insight (Will Larson): **write the strategy down** so it can be critiqued, aligned on, and improved.
- Referenced framework: Richard Rumelt’s strategy structure (**Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, Actions**).

## What was preserved
- The emphasis that a written strategy creates a baseline for alignment and iteration.
- The Rumelt framing as the backbone for the roadmap narrative.

## What was added to make it executable
- A concrete **input/output contract** (what to ask for; what to deliver).
- A step-by-step workflow that turns strategy into a roadmap with owners, dependencies, milestones, and metrics.
- Templates, checklists, and a scoring rubric to validate quality before sharing.
