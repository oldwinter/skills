# Rubric — Running Decision Processes (1–5)

Score the Decision Process Pack before finalizing. Use the total to decide whether to ask for more input or proceed with assumptions.

## 1) Decision clarity
1 = Vague / multiple decisions mixed together  
3 = Clear decision, but deadline or scope is fuzzy  
5 = One-sentence decision + deadline + scope boundaries are explicit

## 2) Options and tradeoffs
1 = Only one “preferred” option; strawman alternatives  
3 = Multiple options, but tradeoffs are not explicit  
5 = 2–4 viable options; tradeoffs and reversibility are clearly articulated

## 3) Assumptions explicitness (learning readiness)
1 = Mostly intuition; assumptions not written down  
3 = Some assumptions listed; not testable  
5 = Key assumptions are explicit, testable, and paired with a review plan

## 4) Decision rights and alignment
1 = Unclear who decides; hidden vetoes likely  
3 = Roles exist but veto/escalation rules are fuzzy  
5 = One Decider (or defined body), clear consult/inform list, explicit veto/escalation rules

## 5) Process fit (speed vs rigor)
1 = Process is mismatched to stakes (too heavy or too light)  
3 = Mostly right, but timelines/participants are unrealistic  
5 = Process is timeboxed, executable, and matched to reversibility and stakes

## 6) Communication and follow-through
1 = Decision not logged or communicated; execution diffuses  
3 = Some comms/logging; weak ownership or review loop  
5 = Decision log + clear owner + comms + milestones + review date/metrics

## Interpreting scores
- **26–30:** ship as-is
- **20–25:** ship with explicit assumptions + a short “unknowns” list
- **< 20:** do another intake round (max 5 questions) before finalizing
