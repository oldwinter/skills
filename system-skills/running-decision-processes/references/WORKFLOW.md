# Workflow (Expanded) — Running Decision Processes

This file expands `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance, heuristics, and failure modes.

## Step 1 — Classify the decision (speed vs rigor)
Heuristics:
- **Two-way door:** default to speed; decide with a lightweight memo + short consult loop; set a quick review date.
- **One-way door:** invest in clarity: explicit criteria, explicit decision rights, explicit assumptions, and explicit comms.

Failure modes:
- Treating every decision as one-way door (“process tax”).
- Treating an irreversible decision as reversible (“we’ll fix it later”).

## Step 2 — Make the decision explicit (anti-hesitation)
Heuristics:
- If the team is debating forever, the decision is usually **underspecified** (what exactly are we deciding?) or decision rights are unclear.
- When both options are bad, make the tradeoff explicit: “We accept downside A to avoid downside B.”

Failure modes:
- Avoiding the decision by asking for “more data” when data cannot resolve it.
- Confusing a preference conflict with a decision-quality conflict.

## Step 3 — Historian pass (reduce repeating failures)
Heuristics:
- Assume the org remembers: old decisions create invisible constraints.
- Ask tenured folks: “What did we try? What did we learn? What would you never do again?”

Failure modes:
- Re-litigating old battles without acknowledging history.
- Ignoring “baggage” until it shows up as a hidden veto late in the process.

## Step 4 — Options, criteria, and explicit assumptions
Heuristics:
- A good option set is usually **2–4** choices, not 10.
- Write assumptions as **testable statements** (what must be true).
- If criteria are all “high priority,” you don’t have criteria—you have a wish list.

Failure modes:
- Only comparing “the preferred option” vs a strawman.
- Writing a matrix that hides disagreement by averaging away concerns.

## Step 5 — Decision rights and process design
Heuristics:
- Ensure there is exactly one **Decider** (or a defined decision body).
- Make veto power explicit. Hidden vetoes create churn.
- Prefer **async pre-read + short meeting** for busy orgs:
  - pre-read deadline
  - consult window
  - decision meeting (30–60 minutes)

Failure modes:
- Too many people in the decision meeting (turns into a debate club).
- Unclear roles (“everyone decides”) → no accountability.

## Step 6 — Curiosity loop (contextual advice, not generic opinions)
Heuristics:
- Ask questions that force rationale:
  - “Pick top 2 options and why.”
  - “What is the most important missing piece of context?”
  - “What would change your mind?”
- Curate a mix of:
  - domain experts
  - people who know your org constraints
  - people who will be impacted

Failure modes:
- Asking “Do you like this?” (invites weak signal).
- Asking too broadly (low response rate; generic feedback).

## Step 7 — Decide and commit (document the why)
Heuristics:
- The meeting goal is not consensus; it’s **clarity and commitment**.
- Document:
  - decision
  - rationale + tradeoffs
  - assumptions
  - owner
  - what would trigger a revisit

Failure modes:
- Decision made but not communicated (“shadow decision”).
- No owner, so execution diffuses.

## Step 8 — Review loop (make intuition testable)
Heuristics:
- Set a review date at decision time (“we’ll revisit” without a date means never).
- Compare outcomes vs assumptions and capture learning.

Failure modes:
- No review, so the org never learns (intuition stays implicit).
- Blame-based retros; keep it decision-quality focused, not ego-focused.
