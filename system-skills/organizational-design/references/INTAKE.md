# Intake (Organizational Design)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What are you optimizing for and by when?** (speed, UX coherence, cost, reliability, accountability) What are success metrics?
2) **What’s the current structure?** Teams + rough charters + reporting lines (even a rough list is fine).
3) **What’s broken today (with examples)?** Where do delays/rework happen and why?
4) **How coupled is the product/tech?** Which areas require tight integration vs can run independently with clean interfaces?
5) **What constraints are non-negotiable?** Headcount budget, critical launches, regulatory/compliance, geography/time zones, leadership preferences.

## Context (as needed)
- What “units” do you ship against (journeys, products, markets, platforms, capabilities)?
- Where are dependencies most painful (shared services, data, design systems, approvals, unclear ownership)?
- Who are the key decision-makers and approvers today? Where do decisions get stuck?
- What’s the talent/experience level (many new managers? strong functional craft leadership?) and appetite for change?
- What history exists (recent reorgs, morale/attrition risk, trust issues, prior failures)?

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A conservative Org Design Brief with explicit assumptions and unknowns
- A draft current-state map that highlights likely dependency hotspots and decision bottlenecks
- 2 options (centralized vs decentralized) with clear tradeoffs
- A minimal transition plan that prioritizes continuity and low-risk sequencing
