# Templates — Organizational Design

Use these templates to produce an Organizational Design Pack. Copy/paste and fill.

## 1) Org Design Brief (template)

**Context:** (company stage, domain, size; functions in-scope)  
**Why now:** (what changed; what’s breaking)  
**Time horizon:** (when must outcomes improve?)  

**Design problem (1–2 sentences):**  

**What we’re optimizing for (ranked 1–5):**
1)  
2)  
3)  
4)  
5)  

**Success metrics (top 3):**
-  
-  
-  

**Constraints / non-negotiables:**
- Headcount/budget:  
- Critical launches / immovable dates:  
- Regulatory/compliance/security:  
- Geography/time zones:  
- Leadership preferences:  

**Design principles (3–5):**
-  
-  
-  

## 2) Current-State Map (template)

### A) Current teams + charters

| Team | Charter (what they own) | Primary interfaces | Key dependencies | Top pain points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

### B) Dependency hotspots (top 5)
1)  
2)  
3)  
4)  
5)  

### C) Decision rights (current)

| Decision type | Current decider | Who is consulted | Typical bottleneck | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

### D) Management layers snapshot (current)
- Layers between IC → CEO/GM:  
- Where managers don’t know the work (examples):  
- Where “people management” is detached from craft (risk areas):  

## 3) Operating Model Decision (template)

### A) Centralization posture (Apple-like ↔ Amazon-like)
**Chosen posture:** more centralized / balanced / more decentralized  
**Rationale:**  
**What is standardized (must be consistent):**
-  
**What is allowed to vary (autonomy zones):**
-  

### B) Functional ↔ divisional/value-stream posture
**Chosen posture:** more functional / balanced / more divisional/value-stream  
**Rationale:**  
**Implications (what changes because of this choice):**
-  

### C) Guardrails
- “We will not decentralize decisions about ____ without standards/interfaces.”
- “We will not centralize decisions about ____ because it creates bottlenecks.”

## 4) Org Options (template)

Create 2–3 options. Keep each option concrete and comparable.

### Option A — (name)
**Summary:**  
**Where on the spectrums:** (centralized/decentralized; functional/divisional)  
**Pros (what improves):**
-  
**Cons (what worsens):**
-  
**Key dependencies removed (vs moved):**
-  
**Risks/assumptions:**
-  

**Teams + charters (proposed):**
| Team | Charter | Interfaces | Dependencies | Leadership roles |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

**Decision rights changes (top 5):**
1)  
2)  
3)  
4)  
5)  

### Option B — (name)
(repeat)

### Option C (optional) — (hybrid)
(repeat)

## 5) Recommendation + Scorecard (template)

**Recommended option:**  
**Fallback option:**  

**Rubric score summary:**
- Mission/optimization fit: _/5
- Dependency reduction + parallelism: _/5
- UX/customer coherence: _/5
- Decision rights clarity: _/5
- Leadership/craft leverage (layers + managers): _/5
- Feasibility + transition risk: _/5

**Decision narrative (why this, why now, why not the others):**  

**Day 1 changes (minimum viable reorg):**
-  

**Follow-on changes (next 30–90 days):**
-  

## 6) Operating Mechanisms (template)

**Decision rights (new):**
- What is centralized:
- What is decentralized:
- Escalation triggers:

**Planning cadence:**
- Where does prioritization happen?
- How are cross-team dependencies managed?
- How are standards enforced (and by whom)?

**Interface contracts (examples):**
- Platform ↔ Product:
- Design Systems ↔ Feature teams:
- Data ↔ Product:

## 7) Transition Plan (template)

**Guiding approach:** (pilot vs phased rollout vs big-bang; rationale)  

### A) Sequencing (phases)
| Phase | Dates | What changes | Owners | Success checks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

### B) Comms plan
- Audience groups (execs, managers, ICs, partners):
- Narrative outline (why now, what changes, what stays, how decisions work):
- FAQ topics (career paths, reporting, priorities, how to escalate issues):

### C) Risk mitigations
- Continuity plan for critical work:
- Morale/attrition risks:
- “Unknown approver” risks:
- Rollback triggers:

### D) Measurement and checkpoints
- Day 30 check:
- Day 60 check:
- Day 90 check:

## 8) Risks / Open questions / Next steps (template)

**Risks (top 5):**
1)  
2)  
3)  
4)  
5)  

**Open questions:**
-  

**Next steps (next 1–2 weeks):**
1)  
2)  
3)
