# Checklists — Organizational Design

Use these checklists before finalizing the Organizational Design Pack and during rollout.

## A) Pack quality checklist (pre-flight)
- Optimization target is explicit (what gets better, by when) with 1–3 success metrics.
- Constraints/non-negotiables are listed (headcount, launches, compliance, time zones).
- Current-State Map captures real dependency/decision bottlenecks (not just org chart).
- Operating Model Decision is explicit (centralization + functional/divisional posture) with guardrails.
- At least 2 org options are presented with clear pros/cons and assumptions.
- Recommendation includes “Day 1 changes” vs “follow-on changes”.
- Decision rights are clear enough that a manager can answer “who decides?” without ambiguity.
- Management layers and leadership roles are explicit (no hidden “manager-only” layers).
- Transition plan includes comms, sequencing, and safety rails (continuity + rollback triggers).
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps are included.

## B) Dependency & parallelism checklist
- Top dependency hotspots are listed and addressed (removed or given a stable interface).
- Interfaces between teams are explicit (what inputs/outputs are exchanged, and how often).
- Shared services/platform teams have clear service boundaries and prioritization mechanisms.
- The reorg does not merely “move dependencies” without reducing coordination load.

## C) UX coherence checklist (when customer experience is integrated)
- There is a clear owner for end-to-end journeys that must feel coherent.
- Standards are documented (design system, API standards, quality bar) and enforcement is clear.
- Decentralized teams still align on shared UX principles and cross-cutting decisions.

## D) Decision rights checklist
- Decisions have explicit owners (and escalation triggers).
- “Consulted vs informed” is clear to avoid consensus-by-default.
- Decisions are logged somewhere durable (doc hub/decision log).

## E) Transition & people-risk checklist
- In-flight projects have stable ownership during the transition.
- Managers have a clear message for their team: what changes, what stays, what to do next.
- The plan avoids serial reorgs; check-ins are scheduled (Day 30/60/90) to adjust based on reality.
