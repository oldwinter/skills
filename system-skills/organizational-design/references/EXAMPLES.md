# Examples — Organizational Design

Use these as starting prompts and as calibration for what “good output” looks like.

## Example 1 (good) — Reduce dependencies and increase parallelism

**Prompt**
“Use `organizational-design`. Context: B2B SaaS, ~200 people; Product/Eng/Design/Data in-scope. Current structure: 6 feature teams, 1 platform team, 1 data team; many shared dependencies. Symptoms: slow delivery, rework, roadmap thrash. Goals: increase parallelism and shorten cycle time without fragmenting UX. Constraints: no net-new headcount for 2 quarters; major launch in 10 weeks. Output: Organizational Design Pack.”

**What good output includes**
- Current-State Map that names the top dependency hotspots (platform bottleneck, approvals, unclear ownership).
- Operating Model Decision that clarifies what is standardized (platform interfaces, design system) vs decentralized (feature prioritization within guardrails).
- 2–3 options (e.g., stronger platform productization; value-stream teams with explicit interfaces; hybrid).
- Recommendation with Day 1 changes + follow-on plan and a transition sequence that protects the upcoming launch.

## Example 2 (good) — Simplify layers and strengthen functional leadership

**Prompt**
“Use `organizational-design`. Context: consumer marketplace, ~80 people; Product/Eng/Design in-scope. Symptoms: too many managers, slow decisions, managers detached from craft. Goal: regain ‘startup speed’ and improve quality. Constraints: avoid serial reorgs; minimize churn. Output: Organizational Design Pack.”

**What good output includes**
- Current-state layer snapshot and where managers lack domain/craft context.
- Operating Model Decision leaning more functional with clear craft/quality ownership.
- Options that simplify layers (e.g., player-coach managers, fewer management-only roles) and clarify decision rights.
- Transition plan that sequences changes and includes comms + risks.

## Boundary example (not appropriate) — HR/legal-driven downsizing

**Prompt**
“Use `organizational-design` to design a reorg that helps us reduce headcount quickly.”

**Expected response behavior**
- Clarify that org design for outcomes is different from downsizing execution.
- Recommend involving HR/legal and establishing strategy/constraints first.
- If still needed, limit output to operating-model clarification and risk-aware sequencing (no individual targeting).
