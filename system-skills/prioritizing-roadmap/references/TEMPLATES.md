# Templates (Copy/Paste)

Use these templates to produce the **Roadmap Prioritization Pack**.

## 0) Context snapshot (bullets)
- Product:
- Primary customer segment:
- Decision to make (and deadline):
- Horizon + cadence:
- North Star / primary goal:
- Guardrails (2–5):
- Constraints (capacity/commitments/dependencies/deadlines):
- Stakeholders (deciders/contributors/approvers):
- Notes / assumptions:

## 1) Season framing
### Season name
One line: “Season of ___” (or similar).

### Why now (what changed)
- …

### Season bets (3–5)
1) …
2) …

### Non-goals (3–7)
- …

### Success criteria
- Primary metric (common currency):
- Guardrails:

## 2) Opportunity inventory (truth vs hypotheses)
Write each item as a problem/outcome statement and tag conviction + evidence.

| Opportunity | Target segment | Problem statement (1–2 lines) | Intended outcome metric/driver | Conviction (Known/Belief/Hypothesis) | Evidence (1–3 bullets) | Effort (S/M/L) | Dependencies | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | | | |

## 3) Scoring model (common currency + ICE)
### Common currency
Choose one:
- North Star units
- Revenue/margin
- Cost reduction
- Risk reduction (severity × probability)

### ICE scales (example)
Adjust scales to your context; document them here.

**Impact (0–5)**
- 5 = Step-change impact in the common currency for this horizon
- 3 = Meaningful impact, visible within the horizon
- 1 = Marginal impact or unclear time-to-impact

**Confidence (0–5)**
- 5 = Strong evidence (data + repeated customer signal + successful precedent)
- 3 = Some evidence (directional data or strong qualitative signal)
- 1 = Mostly hypothesis

**Ease (0–5)** (or invert as Effort)
- 5 = Small/simple, low dependencies
- 3 = Medium, some dependencies
- 1 = Large/complex, many dependencies

ICE score (example): `Impact × Confidence × Ease`

### Scoring table
| Opportunity | Common-currency impact (range) | Impact (0–5) | Confidence (0–5) | Ease (0–5) | ICE score | Key assumptions | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| | | | | | | | |

## 4) Shortlist + parking lot
### Shortlist (committed candidates)
List the top set you will turn into a roadmap:
1) …

### Parking lot (not now)
List items you are explicitly not doing this cycle (and why):
- …

## 5) Roadmap draft
Pick one format (or provide both if helpful).

### Option A — Now / Next / Later
| Now (0–6 weeks) | Next (6–12 weeks) | Later (future / needs discovery) |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

### Option B — Quarterly themes
| Quarter | Theme | Key initiatives | Notes / dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

### Rolling plan cadence
- Rolling horizon (e.g., 12–24 months):
- Refresh cadence (e.g., every 6 months):
- Update triggers (e.g., major market change, metric shift, exec decision):

## 6) Decision narrative (why these, why now)
### One-paragraph summary
Explain the season and top priorities.

### Top reasons (bullets)
- …

### Non-goals (explicit “no’s”)
- …

### Think Bigger (required)
With 20% more time, what would we do that isn’t on this list?
- Big bet idea:
  - Why it matters:
  - What we’d need to believe/learn:
  - Discovery next step:

## 7) Alignment + communication plan
| Audience | What they need | Format | Frequency | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

### Roadmap update mechanism
- Where the single source of truth lives:
- How new inputs are handled:
- How/when priorities are re-scored:

## 8) Risks / Open questions / Next steps (required)
### Risks
- …

### Open questions
- …

### Next steps
1) …
2) …
