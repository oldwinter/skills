# Rubric (Score the Pack)

Score each category **0–2** and sum. Use the notes to decide what to fix.

Scale:
- **0 = Missing / unacceptable**
- **1 = Partial / unclear**
- **2 = Strong / clear / decision-ready**

## Scoring table

| Category | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Decision framing clarity | | | |
| Season framing usefulness (why now + bets + non-goals) | | | |
| Opportunity inventory quality (problem/outcome, evidence, conviction) | | | |
| Common-currency scoring reproducibility | | | |
| Tradeoffs explicitness (“no’s”, parking lot, constraints) | | | |
| Roadmap coherence (sequencing + cadence) | | | |
| Balance (core vs growth vs quality vs big bets) | | | |
| Alignment readiness (narrative + comms + owners) | | | |
| Risks/open questions/next steps quality | | | |

## Interpretation
- **16–18:** Strong. Ready to share and align.
- **12–15:** Usable but has gaps; fix the lowest-scoring categories.
- **<12:** Not decision-ready; revisit decision framing, season framing, and the scoring model.
