# Intake (Roadmap Prioritization)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and provide 2–3 roadmap options.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What’s the product and primary customer segment?** Who is the target user/buyer?
2) **What decision are we making right now?** (rank backlog, pick next quarter themes, annual planning, etc.) What’s the deadline for the decision?
3) **What is success for this horizon?** (North Star / business goal) + 2–5 **guardrails** (quality, trust, margin, churn, support load, etc.)
4) **What’s the planning horizon and cadence?** (6 weeks / quarter / 6 months / rolling 12–24 months) How often will you refresh the roadmap?
5) **What constraints must we respect?** Capacity (teams), hard commitments (compliance/reliability), dependencies, fixed dates, risk tolerance.

## Opportunity inventory (as needed)
- Do you already have a list of candidate initiatives/opportunities? If yes, provide:
  - 1–2 line **problem statement** and target segment
  - Expected outcome metric (or driver)
  - Any evidence (research, data, customer quotes, past experiments)
  - Rough effort/size (S/M/L) + dependencies
- If you don’t have a list, what are the top 10 “inputs” (requests, ideas, problems) you’re considering?

## “Season” framing (optional but powerful)
- What changed recently in the market/customer/tech that matters most right now?
- If you had to name the next 6–12 months as a “season”, what would it be and why?
- What should be explicitly **out of scope** this season?

## Stakeholders + alignment
- Who must agree? Who will execute? Who can veto?
- What prior decisions/strategies must this roadmap align to?
- What format works best for alignment (workshop, async review, exec memo)?

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A **Context snapshot** stating assumptions
- A **season framing** with 2–3 plausible season options
- A **scoring model** with defined scales and clearly labeled uncertainty
- 2–3 **roadmap scenarios** (base/aggressive/conservative)
- A short list of **open questions** that would change the ranking
