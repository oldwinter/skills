# Checklists (Quality Gates)

Use these checklists before finalizing the Roadmap Prioritization Pack.

## A) Decision framing checklist
- Decision is explicit (what will be decided, by whom, by when)
- Horizon and cadence are defined
- Success criteria are clear (primary metric + guardrails)
- Constraints are explicit (capacity, commitments, dependencies, deadlines)
- Stakeholders and alignment forum are identified

## B) Season framing checklist
- Season name is memorable and matches real context
- “Why now” is stated in plain language (2–4 bullets)
- 3–5 season bets are explicit
- 3–7 non-goals prevent “everything is priority”
- Success criteria map back to the season bets

## C) Opportunity inventory checklist
- Every item is a **problem/outcome statement**, not a feature list
- Each item has a target segment and intended outcome metric/driver
- Conviction level (Known/Belief/Hypothesis) is tagged
- Evidence is summarized (1–3 bullets) and not hand-wavy
- Discovery vs delivery is separated (unknowns aren’t treated as commitments)

## D) Scoring model checklist (common currency)
- Common currency is explicit and appropriate for the decision
- Impact/Confidence/Ease scales are defined (not implied)
- Assumptions are written down (and time-to-impact considered)
- Rankings can be reproduced by a second reviewer using the same scales
- A “common currency” mapping exists for cross-team comparisons (if multiple teams)

## E) Roadmap draft checklist
- Roadmap format matches the level of uncertainty (Now/Next/Later vs themes vs rolling plan)
- Sequencing reflects dependencies and learning gates
- Capacity constraints are respected (not everything is “Now”)
- Parking lot is explicit (what we are not doing, and why)
- Update cadence and triggers are defined (rolling plan)

## F) Alignment + communication checklist
- Decision narrative answers: why now, why these, why not others
- “Think Bigger” section exists and includes 3–5 ideas
- A single source of truth is defined
- Communication plan specifies audiences, cadence, and owners

## G) Final pack checklist (shareable as-is)
- Includes all deliverables listed in `../SKILL.md`
- Uses plain language; minimal jargon
- Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**
- Assumptions are explicit; open questions are actionable
