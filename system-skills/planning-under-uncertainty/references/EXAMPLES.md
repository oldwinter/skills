# Examples

**Example 1 (ambiguous initiative):** “We think onboarding is hurting conversion, but we’re not sure why. Create an uncertainty plan with hypotheses, experiments, and pivot triggers.”  
Expected: an uncertainty map + experiment portfolio (qual + quant) + a Plan v0 that commits to learning milestones, not premature delivery dates.

**Example 2 (wartime):** “Retention dropped 15% this week after a release. We need a wartime plan: diagnose root causes, run rapid tests, and decide whether to rollback or patch.”  
Expected: diagnosis-first workflow with falsifiable hypotheses, tight guardrails, and explicit rollback/escalation triggers.

**Boundary example:** “Write a full PRD for Feature X.”  
Response: clarify uncertainty first (this skill), then use `writing-prds` once the hypotheses, constraints, and decision gates are clear.
