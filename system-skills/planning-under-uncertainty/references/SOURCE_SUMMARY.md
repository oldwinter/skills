# Source Summary (Planning Under Uncertainty)

This skill pack converts the Refound/Lenny skill `sources/refound/raw/planning-under-uncertainty/SKILL.md` into an execution contract for leaders.

## What the original covered

The source skill is insight-heavy and framed as tactical advice on planning under uncertainty from “44 product leaders (52 insights)”. The raw file in this repo includes 5 detailed insights (quotes + “apply this by” bullets) and references a deeper guest list that is not present in the raw folder.

## How those insights were converted

### 1) Experiments should be hypothesis-driven learning (Ramesh Johari)
- **Rule:** Every experiment must include a hypothesis, expected learning, and a decision it enables; “failed” results are valuable if they change a decision.
- **Where it shows up:** `SKILL.md` Steps 4–5; `references/TEMPLATES.md` (hypothesis + decision rule columns); `references/CHECKLISTS.md` (hypotheses/experiments).

### 2) Crisis requires humility and diagnosis first (Alex Hardimen)
- **Rule:** In wartime, prioritize diagnosis and falsifiable hypotheses before taking irreversible action.
- **Where it shows up:** `SKILL.md` Steps 1–2; `references/WORKFLOW.md` (“wartime humility”).

### 3) Process quality beats idea quality in uncertain markets (Nikita Bier)
- **Rule:** Build a reproducible testing process (portfolio + cadence + roles) so you can take many shots at bat.
- **Where it shows up:** `SKILL.md` Step 5; `references/WORKFLOW.md` (reproducible testing process).

### 4) Data is a compass, not a GPS (Shaun Clowes)
- **Rule:** Use data to falsify bad assumptions and check direction; avoid waiting for data to “give the answer”.
- **Where it shows up:** `SKILL.md` Step 6; `references/WORKFLOW.md` (data as compass); `references/CHECKLISTS.md` (data-as-compass).

### 5) Plans need buffers and contingencies (Upasna Gautam)
- **Rule:** Build explicit buffers and contingency paths; define triggers for when to use them or pivot.
- **Where it shows up:** `SKILL.md` Step 6; `references/TEMPLATES.md` (buffers/contingencies/triggers); `references/CHECKLISTS.md` (buffers + triggers).

## What was manufactured (not explicitly in the source)
- A full **Uncertainty Planning Pack** output contract (deliverables + templates)
- A step-by-step 7-step workflow (inputs/actions/outputs/checks)
- Checklists + rubric so outputs are testable and repeatable
