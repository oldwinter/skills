# Rubric (Planning Under Uncertainty)

Score each item 0/1/2:
- 0 = missing / unusable
- 1 = present but incomplete
- 2 = clear, executable, reusable

Suggested passing bar: **>= 14/18**.

## 1) Decision clarity (0–2)
- Objective, “why now”, and time horizon are explicit.
- Decision owner(s) and decision type (stop/pivot/scale/commit) are clear.

## 2) Mode fit (0–2)
- Wartime vs peacetime mode is correctly chosen and justified.
- The plan matches urgency (diagnosis-first in crisis).

## 3) Uncertainty mapping (0–2)
- Unknowns/assumptions are concrete and prioritized.
- Confidence/impact and validation methods exist for top items.

## 4) Hypothesis quality (0–2)
- Hypotheses are falsifiable and tied to a mechanism.
- Each hypothesis maps to a decision.

## 5) Experiment portfolio (0–2)
- Experiments are feasible and appropriately sized.
- Each has owner, timeline, and expected learning.

## 6) Metrics as compass (0–2)
- Primary signals are leading and directional; guardrails exist.
- The pack avoids false precision and includes “disprove” signals.

## 7) Buffers + contingencies (0–2)
- Buffers are explicit and proportional to uncertainty.
- Contingency paths and triggers are operational (“if X then Y”).

## 8) Cadence + comms (0–2)
- Learning/decision cadence exists with a runnable agenda.
- Stakeholder updates and decision logging are covered.

## 9) Actionability (0–2)
- Risks/open questions/next steps are actionable with owners and time bounds.
- A team could execute without additional interpretation meetings.
