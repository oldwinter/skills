# Templates (Planning Under Uncertainty)

Copy/paste these templates to produce an Uncertainty Planning Pack.

## 1) Uncertainty Planning Pack (full outline)

```md
# Uncertainty Planning Pack — <project / initiative>

## 1) Decision frame
- Objective:
- Why now:
- Time horizon:
- Mode: (wartime / peacetime)
- Decision owner (stop/pivot/scale):
- Success metrics:
- Guardrails (“must not worsen”):
- Non-negotiable constraints:
- What is flexible (scope/time/resources/quality/segment):

## 2) Uncertainty map (assumptions + unknowns)
Top 5 unknowns (highest impact):
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)

| Assumption / unknown | Type (market/user/tech/ops/legal) | Confidence (H/M/L) | Impact (H/M/L) | How we’ll validate | Owner | By when | Decision impacted |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## 3) Hypotheses + experiment portfolio
Principle: “Winning” = learning that changes a decision.

| Hypothesis | If true… | If false… | Experiment / test | Primary signal (compass) | Guardrails | Segment / sample | Duration | Decision rule (stop/pivot/scale) | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## 4) Plan v0 (phases + learning gates)
| Phase | Goal | Output(s) | Learning gate (what must be true) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Reduce uncertainty |  |  |  |
| 2 | Commit to direction |  |  |  |
| 3 | Execute + rollout |  |  |  |

## 5) Buffers, contingencies, and triggers
Buffers:
- Time buffer:
- Capacity buffer:
- Budget buffer:

Contingencies (Plan A/B/C):
- Plan A:
- Plan B:
- Plan C:

Triggers (if X then Y):
- If <signal> crosses <threshold>, then we will <rollback/pivot/escalate> by <when>.

## 6) Cadence + comms
Learning/decision cadence:
- Wartime (default if crisis): daily/48-hour review for top hypotheses
- Peacetime: weekly learning review; biweekly decision checkpoint

Learning review agenda:
1) What changed since last review?
2) What did we learn (hypothesis results)?
3) What decisions do we make now (stop/pivot/scale)?
4) What are the next experiments?
5) Risks and mitigations

Stakeholder update template:
- Status: (green/yellow/red) + what changed
- This week’s learning:
- Decisions made / needed (owner + deadline):
- Next tests and dates:
- Risks / mitigations:

Decision log location:

## 7) Risks / Open questions / Next steps
**Risks:**
- ...

**Open questions:**
- ...

**Next steps (owners + dates):**
- ...
```

## 2) Hypothesis writing patterns (copy/paste)

```md
- Hypothesis: “If <we do X for segment Y>, then <metric Z> will change by <amount> because <mechanism>.”
- Primary signal (compass): <leading indicator that changes quickly>
- Guardrails: <metrics that must not get worse>
- Decision rule: “If we see <threshold> by <date>, we will <scale/pivot/stop>.”
```

## 3) Simple decision log

```md
| Date | Decision | Decision owner | Evidence / rationale | Follow-ups (owner/date) |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |
```

## 4) Risk register (lightweight)

```md
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Early signal | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
```
