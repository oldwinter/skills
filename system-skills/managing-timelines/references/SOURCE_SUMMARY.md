# Source Summary (Managing Timelines)

This skill pack converts the Refound/Lenny skill `sources/refound/raw/managing-timelines/SKILL.md` into an execution contract.

## What the original covered

The source skill is insight-heavy and includes highlights from several product leaders. The raw file in this repo includes 5 detailed insights and references “13 guests” overall.

## How those insights were converted

### 1) Deadlines must be treated as P0 (Nan Yu)
- **Rule:** If a deadline is real, it becomes the highest priority and other work must be explicitly deprioritized.
- **Where it shows up:** `SKILL.md` Step 6 (scope control + distraction shield); `references/CHECKLISTS.md` (scope protection); templates for cut list + freeze points.

### 2) Defeat “productive procrastination” by starting small (Ada Chen Rekhi)
- **Rule:** Use a tiny “start now” ritual for the hardest timeline task (e.g., 5 minutes on the critical path).
- **Where it shows up:** Optional practice implied in governance/cadence; can be added to team operating cadence if helpful.

### 3) Commit to dates within your control (Annie Pearl)
- **Rule:** Commit to near-term phase outputs (Discovery/Solutioning) first; commit to engineering delivery dates only after solutioning reduces uncertainty.
- **Where it shows up:** `SKILL.md` Step 2–3; `references/WORKFLOW.md` (phase-based planning + commitment ladder).

### 4) AI cadence is uneven (Aparna Chennapragada)
- **Rule:** Separate “time to first demo” from “time to production”; explicitly plan outer-loop work (eval, safety, reliability, rollout).
- **Where it shows up:** `SKILL.md` Step 4; `references/WORKFLOW.md` (AI/ML section); `references/TEMPLATES.md` (outer-loop prompts).

### 5) Use RAG + frequent reviews to unblock work (Brian Chesky)
- **Rule:** Use a simple RAG system and frequent (weekly) review to find bottlenecks and force decisions.
- **Where it shows up:** `SKILL.md` Step 5; `references/WORKFLOW.md` (RAG + governance); templates for weekly updates + escalation notes.

## What was manufactured (not explicitly in the source)
- A full **Timeline Management Pack** output contract (deliverables + templates)
- A step-by-step 8-step workflow (inputs/actions/outputs/checks)
- Checklists + rubric so output is testable and repeatable
