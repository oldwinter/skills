# EXAMPLES (User Onboarding)

Use these as reference patterns for what “good” looks like.

## Example 1 — B2B SaaS (integration-heavy setup)

**Context:** Team analytics tool. New admins must connect 1+ integrations before value appears.  
**Goal:** Increase 7-day activation from 12% → 18% by end of quarter; don’t reduce signup completion.  
**Good solution characteristics:**
- First 30 seconds uses **demo data** + a “preview dashboard” so value is immediate.
- First mile milestones: (1) see demo insights, (2) connect first integration, (3) invite teammate, (4) run first report.
- Experiment backlog includes: permission-copy changes, integration defaults, “connect later” deferral, and a guided checklist with progress.

## Example 2 — B2C app (blank-state + choice overload)

**Context:** Fitness app with many programs; new users get overwhelmed.  
**Goal:** Reduce time-to-first-workout from 10 minutes → 3 minutes; increase first-win rate.  
**Good solution characteristics:**
- First 30 seconds: default a “starter workout” with one tap; minimal questions up front.
- First mile plan: progressively collect preferences after first win, not before.
- Guardrails include refunds/cancellations and support tickets.

## Boundary example — Not a product onboarding problem

**Prompt:** “Write a training program for new customer success hires.”  
**Response:** Not in scope; use an HR onboarding/training process. This skill targets in-product onboarding and activation.
