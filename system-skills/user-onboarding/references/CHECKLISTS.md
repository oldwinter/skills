# CHECKLISTS (User Onboarding)

Use these checklists before finalizing the Onboarding & Activation Pack.

## A) Scope + boundary checklist
- [ ] This is **product onboarding/FTUE**, not HR/service onboarding.
- [ ] Primary segment(s) are defined (1–2) and used throughout the plan.
- [ ] Goal includes baseline → target + date; guardrails are explicit.
- [ ] Assumptions are clearly labeled (especially if metrics are missing).

## B) Activation (“aha moment”) checklist
- [ ] Activation is **behavioral** and measurable (event + threshold + time window).
- [ ] There is a plan to validate (correlation with retention; experiment if possible).
- [ ] Activation ties to user value (not just product usage).

## C) First 30 seconds checklist (make it feel magical)
- [ ] The first 30 seconds has a clear “win” (or best proxy is stated).
- [ ] Non-essential setup is deferred (progressive disclosure).
- [ ] Onboarding is interactive; no reliance on passive carousel tours.
- [ ] The product provides immediate feedback and a clear next action.

## D) First mile checklist (milestones → activation)
- [ ] Milestones are 3–6 steps that map to real product actions.
- [ ] Each milestone includes mechanics (templates/defaults/empty states/checklists).
- [ ] Each milestone has a leading-indicator metric and reduces time-to-value.

## E) Measurement + experiment readiness checklist
- [ ] Every proposed experiment has a primary metric + at least one guardrail.
- [ ] Instrumentation needs are listed (events + properties).
- [ ] Rollout/rollback is specified with triggers and monitoring.
- [ ] Risks, open questions, and next steps are included.
