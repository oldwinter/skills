# Source Summary (What was preserved and how it was transformed)

This skill pack was generated from `sources/refound/raw/launch-marketing/SKILL.md` (Launch Marketing).

## Key preserved insights → execution rules

### 1) “Exclusive PR” is often the pragmatic startup path (Arielle Jackson, Emilie Gerber)
- **Rule:** If using PR for an early-stage launch/funding story, explicitly decide **exclusive vs broad** and sequence outreach **one outlet at a time**.
- **Artifact:** PR Outreach Kit (exclusive decision + outlet list + pitch templates).
- **Check:** Pitch is short, specific, and includes only verifiable proof; outreach is not sent without approval.

### 2) A launch needs “sizzle” (Bret Taylor)
- **Rule:** Every launch must define a primary **hook** that earns attention fast (visual demo, artifact reveal, surprising insight), even if it’s not the core utility.
- **Artifact:** Launch Marketing Brief (hook options + selected hook + proof assets).
- **Check:** Hook is concrete and showable; avoids vague hype.

### 3) High-volume experimentation finds the winning tactic (Marc Benioff)
- **Rule:** Plan multiple small launch experiments, define what “sticks,” then **double down** on the winner(s).
- **Artifact:** Measurement + Experiment plan (backlog + thresholds + double-down rule).
- **Check:** Experiments have owners, thresholds, and a stop/scale decision rule.

### 4) Internal readiness matters as much as “what’s coming” (Christine Itwaru)
- **Rule:** Launch plans must include internal enablement (talk track, FAQ, objections) so teams know how to position and support the launch.
- **Artifact:** Internal Readiness Kit.
- **Check:** A sales/support teammate can answer “what is this and why should I care?” without improvising.

## Notes / gaps

The source skill references “guest insights” beyond the top excerpts; only the content present in the source file was available here. This pack therefore focuses on converting the provided top insights into an executable workflow and artifacts.
