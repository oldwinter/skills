# Intake (Positioning & Messaging)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What is the product in 1–2 sentences?** What does it replace or automate?
2) **Who is the ICP and buyer/user?** Industry, company size, role, sophistication.
3) **What is the primary use case / job-to-be-done?** Desired outcome + current workflow.
4) **What is the “against” alternative in real decisions?** Status quo, competitor, internal build, agency, manual workaround.
5) **What proof do we have?** Metrics, customer quotes, logos, case studies, demos, guarantees, compliance, credibility.

## Audience + channel (as needed)
- Which surface(s) matter most right now? (homepage hero, sales deck, outbound emails, ads, onboarding, press)
- What stage are we at? (pre-launch, early traction, scaling, enterprise)
- Any words to avoid, regulated claims, or legal/compliance constraints?
- Desired tone/voice: crisp/technical/playful/serious; examples you like/hate

## Symptoms (help diagnose weak positioning)
- Where do prospects get confused? (“back up and start over” moments)
- Where is the funnel sluggish? (top-of-funnel response, mid-funnel sales cycle, close rate)
- What do customers say you are today (in their own words)?

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A clearly stated ICP + use-case assumption
- 2 category frames + a chosen “pattern match” recommendation
- A positioning statement “against” a likely status quo alternative
- A messaging hierarchy with proof placeholders and a validation plan to fill gaps
