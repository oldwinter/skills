# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance and heuristics.

## Step 1 — Intake + success definition
Anchor on what the messaging must change:
- Comprehension (“what is it?”)
- Relevance (“is this for me?”)
- Recall (“what do I remember tomorrow?”)

If there’s no success signal, define one (e.g., higher homepage-to-demo conversion, fewer “what is this?” questions, shorter sales re-explains).

## Step 2 — “Against” alternative + category frame
Positioning is comparative. Force an explicit “against”:
- Status quo (spreadsheets, email, manual process)
- Workaround (scripts, internal tools)
- Direct/indirect competitor
- Outsourcing/agency/consultant

Category frames:
- “<category> for <audience>”
- “<existing thing> but <key difference>”
- “Replace <old workflow> with <new workflow>”

Heuristic: if the category requires 3 sentences to explain, pick a simpler frame.

## Step 3 — Positioning brief (specific + tradeoffs)
Include:
- Who it’s for (ICP) and the job
- Category (what it is)
- Primary value (outcome)
- Differentiation (why you vs alternative)
- Proof (why believe)
- Tradeoffs/non-goals (what you’re not)

Heuristic: if your positioning has no tradeoff, it’s probably generic.

## Step 4 — Messaging hierarchy (listener-first)
Build:
- Core message (1 sentence)
- 3 pillars (benefit statements)
- Proof points (facts, examples, credibility signals)
- Objections + responses
- “What we mean / what we don’t mean” clarifiers

Memorability prompts:
- Can a listener repeat it after one read?
- Are there concrete nouns/verbs instead of abstractions?

## Step 5 — Copy primitives (direct + pattern-matched)
Aim for:
- Tight language; remove throat-clearing and trend-story setup
- Specific nouns (“SOC2-ready audit trail”) over vague claims (“enterprise-grade”)
- Parallel structure for pillar headlines

Pattern matching for press:
- “It’s like <known product/category> for <new audience/use case>”
- Pair with a clear “but unlike” differentiation clause.

## Step 6 — Consistency + enablement
Consistency means:
- Everyone internally describes the product similarly
- Sales/support can reset confusion quickly without rambling

Enablement assets:
- “Say this / not that” table
- Internal description script (30 seconds)
- Sales talk track (discovery → value → proof → next step)

## Step 7 — Validation plan (understanding + recall)
Prefer fast loops:
- 5 customer/prospect conversations
- 1–2 landing page variants
- Internal “teach-back” test (new hire or adjacent team)

Test questions (examples):
- “What do you think this product is?”
- “Who is this for?”
- “What would you use it for tomorrow?”
- “What’s different vs what you use now?”
- “What do you remember 24 hours later?”

Decision rule example:
- Keep if ≥70% can correctly restate “what it is” + “for whom” and recall 1 pillar after 24h; otherwise revise the category frame or pillar language.

## Step 8 — Quality gate + finalize
Before finalizing:
- Run [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md)
- Score with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md)
- Include Risks/Open questions/Next steps
