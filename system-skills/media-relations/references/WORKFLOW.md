# Workflow notes (expanded guidance)

This file expands the steps in `../SKILL.md` with practical tips and default heuristics.

## 1) “Prep” = newsworthiness + proof

Earned media works best when you have a clear **news peg**:
- What is **new information**?
- Why is it **timely**?
- Who is it **for**, and why should a reporter care?
- What is the **credible proof** you can share?

Heuristic: if you can’t write a 1-sentence headline that starts with something new (not “we’re excited”), you likely need a stronger angle.

## 2) Exclusive vs embargo (and when to skip both)

**Exclusive** (one outlet gets the “first look”) can work when:
- The story is meaningful enough that one outlet can justify investing time.
- You can support it with proof and access (founder interview, demo, data).
- You have a clear fallback if they pass.

**Embargo** (multiple outlets can work on a story before publish time) can work when:
- You want broader coverage and can coordinate timing cleanly.
- You can provide consistent materials and a clear on-the-record spokesperson.

Skip both when:
- The story is small, urgent, or not worth coordination overhead.
- You can’t reliably manage approvals and timelines.

## 3) Building a media list that isn’t “spray and pray”

Prefer **fit over volume**. A good list is:
- Beat-aligned (the reporter actually covers this topic)
- Audience-aligned (the outlet reaches who you want)
- Angle-aligned (you have a specific hook for this reporter)

Minimum data per target:
- Outlet + reporter name
- Beat / recent relevant articles (1–2 titles)
- Hook angle (1 sentence)
- Relationship status (cold / warm / existing)
- Best contact method + timing notes (if known)

## 4) Staggered outreach (how to “offer exclusives” responsibly)

If offering an exclusive:
- Make the offer explicit (“first look” + what access they get + by when you need an answer).
- Don’t imply other outlets are already committed (unless true).
- Timebox the exclusive (e.g., 24–48 hours) so you can proceed.
- Plan a clean handoff to a wider list if they pass.

## 5) Pitch emails: short, specific, reporter-centric

A strong pitch:
- Opens with the **news** in 1 sentence
- Explains “why you / why now” in 1–2 sentences
- Provides 1–3 proof bullets (or “available on request”)
- Offers access (interview, demo, data)
- Ends with a simple CTA (“Interested in a quick chat this week?”)

Avoid:
- Long backstories
- Marketing adjectives doing the work (“innovative”, “game-changing”)
- Attachments by default (use links; respect inbox hygiene)

## 6) Follow-ups and relationship hygiene

Default cadence (adjust to urgency):
- Follow-up #1: 1–2 business days after initial pitch
- Follow-up #2: 2–4 business days later (only if truly relevant)
- Close the loop: “no worries—happy to be a resource for future stories”

Always:
- Thank reporters for their time
- Offer helpful redirects (“who covers this?”)
- Keep notes for next time (what they care about, what they declined)

## 7) Interview prep: control what you can

Prepare:
- 3 key messages (repeatable, not over-scripted)
- 3 proof points (numbers/examples you can safely share)
- Sensitive-topic responses (brief, honest, non-defensive)
- Bridging phrases to return to core points

After:
- Send 3–5 bullets with links and any clarifications
- If you spot an error, request a correction politely with precise facts

## 8) Measuring success (keep it realistic)

Define success by **quality and fit**, not just count:
- Coverage in outlets your audience reads
- Accurate messaging (angle you intended)
- Referral traffic / signups (if measurable)
- Secondary effects (partner interest, recruiting, investor inbound)

Track:
- Outreach conversion (pitches → replies → interviews → coverage)
- Which angles and targets worked best (for iteration)
