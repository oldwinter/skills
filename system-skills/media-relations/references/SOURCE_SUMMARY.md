# Source summary (what this skill preserves and how it was transformed)

## Source
Refound/Lenny skill: `sources/refound/raw/media-relations/SKILL.md`

## Source quality note
The source file in this repo appears **truncated** (several “Key insight” lines cut off). This pack preserves the two visible guest takeaways and fills in missing execution details with standard media-relations practice.

## Key guest insights preserved (and how they map to this pack)
1) **Offer exclusives and stagger outreach** (Emilie Gerber)  
   - Transformed into: `SKILL.md` Step 4 (exclusive/embargo + sequencing) + `references/TEMPLATES.md` exclusive plan + `references/CHECKLISTS.md` section D
2) **Prep → target list → pitch** (Jason Feifer)  
   - Transformed into: `SKILL.md` Steps 2–3–6 and the overall workflow structure

## What was added to make it agent-executable
- Explicit input/output contracts (minimum inputs + missing-info strategy; concrete deliverables)
- A step-by-step workflow with checks at each step
- Copy/paste templates: media list, exclusive plan, pitch emails, tracker, media FAQ, interview prep
- Quality controls: checklists, scoring rubric, and required Risks/Open questions/Next steps
- Safety constraints: no fabricated facts; avoid confidential info; define approvals for embargo/exclusive
