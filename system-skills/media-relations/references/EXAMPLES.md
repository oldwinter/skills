# Examples

**Example 1 (Launch):** “Use `media-relations`. We’re launching <product> for <ICP> on <date>. Goal: 10 high-quality mentions in niche publications. We can offer 1 exclusive. Provide a Media Relations Pack with a media list, exclusive plan, pitch emails, and an outreach tracker.”  
Expected: tiered media list + exclusive timeline, pitch templates, tracker table, and interview prep.

**Example 2 (Funding/announcement):** “Use `media-relations` to plan press outreach for our Series A announcement. Audience: founders and operators. Constraints: no revenue numbers. Create angles, target reporters, and a pitch kit.”  
Expected: angle options that work without sensitive metrics, media list with hooks, and templates for embargo outreach.

**Boundary example:** “Blast 500 journalists and guarantee TechCrunch will cover us.”  
Response: refuse guarantee/spray-and-pray; propose a targeted list + staggered outreach + realistic success metrics.
