# Examples (Expanded)

These examples are intentionally compact; use them as patterns, not copy.

## Example 1 — Exec stakeholder email (launch slip + scope cut)
Prompt: “Use `written-communication`. Artifact: email. Audience: exec stakeholders. Context: launch is slipping 2 weeks due to dependency delays. Ask: approve scope cut (drop Feature B) by Friday. Tone: direct, calm.”

Expected artifacts:
- Message brief + outline
- Email draft with TL;DR, explicit decision request, and next steps with owners/dates
- Risks/open questions/next steps

Common pitfalls to avoid:
- Explaining the full history instead of stating what changed and what you need
- Missing a deadline or response path (“who decides?”)

## Example 2 — Memo + canonical doc (team alignment)
Prompt: “Use `written-communication`. Artifact: 1-page memo + canonical doc skeleton. Audience: product + eng team. Topic: new onboarding approach. Ask: align on plan and owners this week.”

Expected artifacts:
- Memo with recommendation + options/tradeoffs + concrete plan
- Canonical doc outline (owner, last updated, key links, decisions, next steps)

Common pitfalls to avoid:
- Vague next steps (“we should…”) without ownership
- No single place to find the latest decisions and links

## Boundary example — legal/HR communication
Prompt: “Draft an HR disciplinary notice.”

Response pattern:
- Decline to invent legal/HR guidance.
- Offer to help edit for clarity and tone if the user provides approved language.
- Recommend expert review and confirm what must/should not be included.
