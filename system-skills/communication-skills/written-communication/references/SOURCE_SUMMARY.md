# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → Skill Pack)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/written-communication/SKILL.md`

The source skill is “insight-heavy” and provides tactical advice on written communication from product leaders (the excerpt includes 5 guests; the original mentions more).

## Preserved insights → execution rules

### 1) Focus on the “how”, not just the “what/why” (Wes Kao)
- **Rule:** Every artifact must include an explicit “How / Next steps” section with concrete actions.
- **Check:** A reader can act without asking “what do you want me to do?”
- **Where used:** `../SKILL.md` Step 3; [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md) outline + next-steps tables.

### 2) Write to clarify thinking (Julie Zhuo)
- **Rule:** If content feels fuzzy, do a “letter to yourself” clarity pass before polishing.
- **Check:** The final message has a single through-line and no buried lede.
- **Where used:** `../SKILL.md` Step 6; [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) Step 6.

### 3) Writing is clarity at scale (Kevin Yien)
- **Rule:** Optimize for scanability and standalone comprehension (TL;DR, headings, explicit asks).
- **Check:** A skim-reader gets the point in < 60 seconds.
- **Where used:** `../SKILL.md` Step 4; [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) universal checklist; [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md) scanability dimension.

### 4) Create a canonical doc (Naomi Gleit)
- **Rule:** For ongoing work, maintain one canonical doc that links to everything else.
- **Check:** There is one obvious place to find the latest state, decisions, and next steps.
- **Where used:** `../SKILL.md` Step 7; [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md) canonical doc template.

### 5) Take ownership of being understood (Boz)
- **Rule:** Treat communication as the work: make asks explicit, reduce ambiguity, and include follow-through (owners, dates, next update).
- **Check:** The artifact reduces meetings and follow-ups rather than creating them.
- **Where used:** `../SKILL.md` Steps 2 and 8; [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md) “Source of truth + follow-through”.

## What was added to make it agent-executable
- A concrete **Written Communication Pack** output contract (brief, outline, draft, canonical doc option).
- A step-by-step workflow with checks (8 steps).
- Templates, checklists, and a rubric to enforce clarity and actionability.
