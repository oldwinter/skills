# Rubric (Score 1–5)

Score each category from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Use the score to decide whether the pack is ready to use live.

## 1) Objective + ask clarity
1: Ask is missing or changes mid-way.  
3: Ask exists but is not crisp or not tied to audience needs.  
5: Ask is explicit, memorable, and easy to act on.

## 2) Audience fit
1: Content feels generic; audience incentives are ignored.  
3: Some tailoring exists, but key stakeholders aren’t addressed.  
5: Stakeholder concerns are anticipated and addressed with proof.

## 3) Narrative + contrast strength
1: No tension; no clear “why now.”  
3: Contrast exists but is vague or unsupported.  
5: “What is vs what could be” is concrete, evidenced, and compelling.

## 4) Slide clarity + structure
1: Slides are dense or confusing; multiple takeaways per slide.  
3: Mostly clear, but some slides compete for attention or timing is tight.  
5: Clean, single-takeaway slides with a smooth, time-fit flow.

## 5) Proof and credibility
1: Claims are unsupported or hand-wavy.  
3: Some evidence exists but key claims lack support.  
5: Critical claims have credible evidence or clearly labeled assumptions.

## 6) De-risking (pre-brief + alignment)
1: High-stakes talk with no pre-briefing or risk plan.  
3: Some pre-briefing planned but not targeted.  
5: Key stakeholders pre-briefed; surprises removed; changes tracked.

## 7) Delivery readiness
1: No rehearsal; high risk of rambling/reading slides.  
3: One rehearsal completed; timing is close.  
5: Multiple timed runs; record/review done; delivery cues set.

## Interpreting scores
- **32–35:** Solid. Proceed, but tighten weak areas.
- **28–31:** Risky. Rework the lowest two categories.
- **< 28:** Do not present yet. Rebuild narrative/structure and rehearse.
