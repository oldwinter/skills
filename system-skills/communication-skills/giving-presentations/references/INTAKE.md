# Intake (Question Bank)

Use these questions to gather the minimum context to produce a Presentation Pack. Ask **3–5 at a time**.

## A) Objective + ask (required)
1) What is the presentation type and setting (all-hands / keynote / exec review / customer demo)? In-person or Zoom?
2) What outcome do you want: **inform, align, decide, persuade**?
3) What is the **ask**? (decision, approval, budget, headcount, commitment, next step)
4) What happens if the audience says “no” or does nothing?

## B) Audience (required)
5) Who is the audience (roles/seniority)? Who are the decision-makers vs influencers vs observers?
6) What does this audience care about most? (cost, risk, speed, growth, user impact, quality, morale)
7) What are they likely skeptical about?

## C) Constraints + logistics (required)
8) Time limit (minutes) and format (Q&A during, at end, none; async recording)?
9) Deadline and level of polish expected (rough alignment vs “big moment”)?
10) Anything sensitive we should avoid naming (customers, metrics, internal details)?

## D) Content inputs (required)
11) What source material exists (doc/bullets/deck/metrics)? Paste or summarize.
12) What are the must-include points (max 5)?
13) What is the “one thing” the audience should remember the next day?

## E) Risks, objections, and politics (recommended)
14) Who could block this, and why?
15) Are there known objections you’ve already heard?
16) Which stakeholders should be pre-briefed before the live meeting?

## F) Delivery preferences (optional)
17) Your comfort level (1–10) and main delivery risk (speed, nerves, monotone, rambling, reading slides)?
18) Any style constraints (minimal text, demo-first, story-first, data-first)?

## Default assumptions (use only if needed)
If the user can’t answer, proceed with these defaults and label them as assumptions:
- Outcome: align + secure a next step
- Ask: a single decision or commitment at the end
- Structure: Context → Tension → Proposal → Proof → Ask → Next steps
- Q&A: 5 minutes at end with top 10 questions prepped
