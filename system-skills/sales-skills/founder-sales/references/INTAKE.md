# Founder Sales — Intake (question bank)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## A) Context + goal
1) What is the product in one sentence, and what does it replace (status quo or competitor)?
2) What is the specific goal and time box (e.g., “10 paying customers in 8 weeks”, “6 design partners in 6 weeks”)?
3) What stage are you at (pre-revenue / some revenue / repeatable motion emerging)?
4) How many customer conversations have you already done, and what patterns are emerging?

## B) ICP + buyer process
5) Who is the target buyer (titles/roles) and what company type (industry, size, maturity)?
6) Who uses it day-to-day vs who signs (buyer vs user)?
7) What is the “hair on fire” trigger that makes them look for help *now*?
8) How do they currently solve this (tools, process, internal workarounds)?
9) What does a “successful 30 days” look like for a customer?

## C) Offer + pricing + risk
10) What’s your offer structure today (pilot, subscription, services, implementation support)?
11) What pricing hypothesis do you have (range is fine)?
12) What are the buyer’s perceived risks (career risk, security/compliance, switching cost, time)?
13) What risk-reversal is acceptable (pilot terms, limited scope, success criteria)?

## D) Founder assets + credibility
14) Why are *you* (the founder) credible here (background, unique insight, prior wins)?
15) What proof points can you use (case studies, demos, references, results, testimonials)?

## E) Outreach constraints + channels
16) How much founder time/week is available for sales conversations and outreach?
17) What channels are acceptable (warm intros, email, LinkedIn, communities, events)?
18) Do you have any existing network or distribution advantage (investors, partners, audience)?

## F) Activation/implementation
19) What does “implemented” mean in practice (steps, stakeholders, time to value)?
20) What resources can you apply to onboarding (founder/engineer time, CS, docs)?
