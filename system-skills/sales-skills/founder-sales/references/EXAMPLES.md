# Founder Sales — Additional Examples

These are optional “worked examples” beyond the short examples in `../SKILL.md`.

## Example A: “No decision” rescue (mid-market ops tool)
**Situation:** Prospects agree there’s pain but keep stalling, asking for “more time” or “send info.”  
**Use:** Produce a Decision Enablement Kit + MAP + bounded pilot framing.

**Strong outputs include:**
- A 1-page decision guide with 3 options (do nothing / DIY / pilot) and explicit criteria
- A pilot scope that can be implemented in <14 days
- A MAP with dates, owners, and concrete artifacts (kickoff, access, first value, review)

## Example B: White-glove activation for a technical product (developer tool)
**Situation:** Deals close verbally but implementation requires engineering time and the customer goes quiet.  
**Use:** Produce an activation definition + implementation checklist + follow-up cadence, and schedule kickoff before signature.

**Strong outputs include:**
- Activation milestones that are observable (integration complete, first event processed, first report generated)
- Weekly check-ins for 4 weeks with escalation paths
- A “time-to-first-value” target and who owns each dependency

## Boundary example: “Lead list scraping”
**Situation:** “Scrape me a list of 5,000 leads and blast them.”  
**Response:** Decline high-volume spam behavior; ask for an ICP wedge and produce a small, testable list with ethical outreach and a learning plan.
