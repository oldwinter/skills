# Sales Qualification — Workflow Notes

This file expands `../SKILL.md` with practical guidance, defaults, and talk tracks.

## Workflow at a glance (7 steps)
1) Intake + define the qualification decision
2) ICP segments + hard disqualifiers
3) Qualification scorecard (fit × need × access × urgency)
4) Stage exit criteria + pipeline hygiene rules
5) Discovery/qualification script + question bank
6) CRM note template + rollout/measurement plan
7) Quality gate + finalize

## Default assumptions (use only if missing)
- Qualification decisions are **triage**: **accept**, **nurture**, or **reject** (not “convince everyone”).
- A “qualified” opportunity must have: **(a) a real problem**, **(b) an ICP fit**, **(c) a path to a decision**, and **(d) a time-bound next step**.
- Use **hard disqualifiers** to protect time; soft uncertainty goes to **nurture** with a follow-up trigger.
- Keep scorecards simple: **5–8 criteria** with clear anchors beats 20 vague questions.
- Pipeline hygiene rule: **No next step, no stage.** If there’s no dated next step, it’s not active.

## Guidance by step

### 1) Define the decision
- Write down the exact decision point (e.g., “After the first call, should we create an opportunity and spend AE time?”).
- Make sure there is a “nurture” path so reps don’t force a “yes” when timing is wrong.

### 2) ICP + disqualifiers
- Disqualifiers should be **observable** and **fast**.
- Prefer disqualifiers that prevent “maybe forever” states:
  - No meaningful pain / impact
  - No access to the real buyer or process
  - No urgency / no trigger
  - Deal size can’t justify the time
- Include a graceful disqualify talk track so reps can exit without burning goodwill.

### 3) Scorecard design
- Map criteria to the most common qualification failures in your funnel.
- Use a mix of:
  - **Fit** (segment, use case, constraints)
  - **Need** (pain severity, impact)
  - **Access** (stakeholders, champion strength, decision steps)
  - **Urgency** (trigger, timeline)
- Add at least 1 “must-pass” criterion (e.g., “has a compelling event in next 90 days”).

### 4) Stage exit criteria
- Stages should reflect buyer progress, not seller activity.
- Each stage must have:
  - required evidence (what we know now)
  - a next step with date
  - a max age before recycle/close-lost

### 5) Script + question bank
- Don’t aim to “pitch”; aim to **diagnose** and decide.
- Use short, direct questions that map to your scorecard.
- Include “disqualify questions” early (segment, use case, urgency).

### 6) CRM notes + rollout
- If it’s not captured in CRM, it won’t be coached or forecasted.
- Run a short calibration:
  - 3 calls with live scoring
  - compare decisions across reps
  - adjust anchors and disqualifiers
- Track 3 metrics during rollout:
  - meeting→opportunity conversion (or lead→opportunity)
  - opportunity→win rate
  - stage aging / % with next steps

### 7) Iteration loop
- After 20–30 calls, review:
  - top 3 disqualifier reasons
  - where deals still stall
  - whether the scorecard predicts wins
- Update disqualifiers, scoring anchors, and stage criteria accordingly.
