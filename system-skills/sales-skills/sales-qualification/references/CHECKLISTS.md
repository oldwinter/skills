# Sales Qualification — Quality Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing the Sales Qualification Pack.

## A) Scope + decision clarity
- [ ] “Qualified” decision is explicit (accept / nurture / reject)
- [ ] Intended user is clear (SDR/AE/founder) and handoffs are defined
- [ ] Boundaries are clear (what this does NOT solve)

## B) ICP segments + disqualifiers (time protection)
- [ ] 1–3 ICP segments are defined with observable attributes
- [ ] Explicit exclusions exist (“not for…”)
- [ ] Hard disqualifiers are fast and objective (not vibes)
- [ ] A graceful disqualify talk track exists (protects goodwill)

## C) Scorecard quality
- [ ] Scorecard has 5–8 criteria with weights and scoring anchors
- [ ] 1–3 must-pass criteria are defined
- [ ] Thresholds produce consistent outcomes (accept/nurture/reject)
- [ ] Criteria map to actual funnel failure modes (not generic theory)

## D) Script + question bank
- [ ] Call flow can be run in 20–30 minutes
- [ ] Questions map to scorecard criteria
- [ ] Includes an explicit nurture path and disqualify path
- [ ] Call ends with a dated next step or a clear close-out

## E) CRM + pipeline hygiene
- [ ] Notes template captures the minimum qualification evidence
- [ ] Required fields/stage exit criteria are explicit
- [ ] “No next step, no stage” rule is included
- [ ] Stalled-deal policy exists (max stage age + recycle/close)

## F) Rollout + measurement
- [ ] A 2-week rollout plan exists (training + call reviews + calibration)
- [ ] KPIs are defined and measurable from your CRM/tools
- [ ] An iteration loop is defined (review after 20–30 calls)

## G) Safety + ethics
- [ ] No requests for secrets (tokens/passwords/credentials)
- [ ] No spam/deception guidance
- [ ] Any sensitive customer data is minimized and handled responsibly

## H) Completeness
- [ ] Pack ends with **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**
