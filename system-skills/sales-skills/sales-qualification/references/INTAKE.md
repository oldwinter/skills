# Sales Qualification — Intake (question bank)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## A) Context + goals
1) What’s the product in one sentence, and what does it replace (status quo/competitor)?
2) What is the primary goal of qualification right now (higher win rate, faster cycle, fewer bad meetings, cleaner pipeline, better forecasting)?
3) Who will use this (SDR, AE, founder) and where does qualification happen (inbound, outbound, both)?

## B) ICP + segments
4) Who is the ideal buyer (titles/roles) and ideal company type (industry, size, maturity)?
5) Who uses it day-to-day vs who signs (user vs economic buyer)?
6) What are explicit “not a fit” exclusions today (industry, size, tech stack, geography, use case)?

## C) Deal reality
7) Typical ACV range and sales cycle length?
8) What stakeholders are usually required (security, IT, finance, legal, procurement)?
9) What is the minimum viable deal (price floor or ROI bar) that justifies rep time?

## D) Triggers + pain + impact
10) What “why now” triggers tend to create urgency (events, deadlines, incidents, growth, tool migration)?
11) What pain does the buyer feel today (in their words)?
12) How do you quantify impact (time, dollars, risk, missed targets)?

## E) Current funnel + failure modes
13) Where do deals die or stall (before meeting, after first call, after demo, during procurement)?
14) Share 3–5 recent examples of “bad leads” and why they were bad (fit, need, access, urgency, budget).
15) What does the current pipeline look like (volume, stage aging, no-next-step deals)?

## F) Process + tooling constraints
16) What CRM do you use and what fields/stages already exist?
17) What is your SLA for responding to inbound leads (if applicable)?
18) Any constraints (compliance, brand voice, no cold calling, etc.)?
