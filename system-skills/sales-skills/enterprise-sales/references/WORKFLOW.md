# Enterprise Sales — Workflow Notes

This file expands `../SKILL.md` with practical defaults, talk tracks, and project-management guidance.

## Workflow at a glance (7 steps)
1) Intake + enterprise qualification
2) Buying committee map + champion
3) Champion enablement kit
4) Decision enablement + Mutual Action Plan (MAP)
5) POC/pilot as business case + ROI
6) Procurement + security execution
7) Quality gate + close-to-implementation

## Default assumptions (use only if missing)
- Buying committees often involve **5–7 roles**; assume at least: Champion, Economic Buyer, IT/Security, Procurement, Legal, and 1–2 day-to-day users.
- The #1 competitor is often **“no decision”** (status quo), not a direct competitor.
- A “POC” should produce a **decision-ready business case** (ROI + success metrics), not a vague “it works”.
- Treat procurement and security like a **project**: owners, dates, dependencies, and a tracker.

## Guidance by step

### 1) Intake + enterprise qualification
- Write a crisp 1-line statement of “what we’re selling” and “what changes if they buy”.
- Define **closed-won** as: signature + kickoff scheduled + first value milestone planned.
- If the request is “help me sell enterprise generally,” re-scope to a specific account/deal.

### 2) Buying committee map + champion
- Your job is not to “convince everyone” directly; it’s to enable the champion to do it internally.
- Common roles to map:
  - **Champion:** drives consensus; needs internal ammo
  - **Economic buyer:** budget owner; cares about ROI and risk
  - **IT/Security:** risk + controls; cares about evidence (SOC2, architecture, DPAs)
  - **Procurement:** process + vendor onboarding; cares about forms, terms, timelines
  - **Legal:** contract language; cares about data handling, liability, termination
  - **Users/Operators:** workflow fit; cares about time-to-value and usability

### 3) Champion enablement kit
- Make everything forwardable: short, plain language, and tailored per stakeholder.
- Include a “what to say” snippet for the champion (talk track).
- If you have no proof points, include a plan to generate them during the pilot (quotes, metrics, screenshots).

### 4) Decision enablement + MAP (reduce “no decision”)
- “No decision” happens when the buyer perceives high career risk and low urgency.
- Make **do nothing** explicit:
  - What breaks if they don’t act?
  - What does it cost (time/$/risk)?
  - What is the opportunity cost (missed roadmap, compliance, SLA risk)?
- MAP must include:
  - a decision date/meeting
  - buyer owners and specific deliverables (not just seller tasks)
  - procurement/security milestones (and their dependencies)

### 5) POC/pilot as business case + ROI
- Rewrite “POC success” as: “We can justify this spend internally.”
- Pilot success criteria should include:
  - outcome metrics (time saved, incidents reduced, revenue protected)
  - adoption metrics (active users, workflows migrated)
  - operational proof (controls met, support burden acceptable)
- If appropriate, propose a paid pilot as a filter; if not, add seriousness gates:
  - dedicated buyer owner
  - agreed timeline
  - access/data commitments
  - decision meeting scheduled before kickoff

### 6) Procurement + security execution
- Procurement advice (operational, not legal):
  - Offer to **pre-fill forms** to make their job easy.
  - Ask for a checklist of what they need and drive it to completion.
  - Track every dependency (security, legal, finance) and unblock proactively.
- Security advice (operational, not legal):
  - Provide a “security packet” index (what docs you have; what you don’t).
  - Don’t share secrets; don’t paste confidential customer data into artifacts.

### 7) Quality gate + close-to-implementation
- Ensure there is a real plan for:
  - signature (who signs + timing)
  - kickoff scheduled
  - first value milestone defined (what will they see/do by day X)
- Always end with **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** so the pack is executable.
