# Enterprise Sales — Quality Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing the Enterprise Deal Execution Pack.

## A) Scope + enterprise fit
- [ ] The deal is scoped to a specific account and use case (not generic enterprise advice)
- [ ] Target ACV/package and timeline are explicit (or clearly labeled assumptions)
- [ ] The top stall risk is identified (no decision vs procurement vs security vs POC)
- [ ] “Closed-won” includes kickoff + first value planning (not just signature)

## B) Buying committee + champion
- [ ] Buying committee map includes champion + economic buyer + IT/security + procurement + legal + users
- [ ] A primary champion is named (or a concrete plan to find one within 1–2 calls)
- [ ] Each stakeholder has: goal, risk/concern, required evidence, and next action
- [ ] Champion plan includes what they need and when (assets + internal sequence)

## C) Champion enablement assets
- [ ] Internal pitch memo is forwardable and 1 page
- [ ] Stakeholder one-pagers exist for IT/security, procurement, legal, and economic buyer
- [ ] Objection/FAQ answers exist for preferred vendor, security delay, POC request, and risk
- [ ] Proof artifacts are included or a plan exists to generate proof during the pilot

## D) Decision enablement (reduce “no decision”)
- [ ] “Do nothing” is explicit and quantified (time/$/risk/opportunity cost)
- [ ] Decision guide includes options + criteria + recommendation
- [ ] Mutual Action Plan (MAP) has dates, owners, and required outputs
- [ ] MAP includes a decision meeting date and buyer-owned commitments

## E) POC/pilot as business case
- [ ] Pilot goal is explicitly “decision-ready business case,” not “feature test”
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable, with owners and data sources
- [ ] ROI model includes assumptions + expected value and cost range
- [ ] Decision criteria and decision date are defined before kickoff
- [ ] Paid pilot or seriousness gates are included (owner, access, timeline)

## F) Procurement + security execution readiness
- [ ] Procurement/security tracker exists with owners, dates, and blockers
- [ ] A plan exists to pre-fill forms and reduce buyer admin burden
- [ ] Security packet index lists what is available vs missing (no secrets)
- [ ] Legal/procurement workstreams have a cadence and escalation path

## G) Completeness + safety
- [ ] Pack ends with Risks / Open questions / Next steps
- [ ] Assumptions & unknowns are labeled with a validation plan
- [ ] No requests for secrets or credentials
- [ ] No legal advice is presented as definitive; counsel is recommended for contract language
