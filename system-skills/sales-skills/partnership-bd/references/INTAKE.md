# Intake — Partnership & BD

Use these questions to collect the minimum viable context. Ask **up to 5** at a time; if answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Quick intake (answer these first)
1) What’s the partnership objective and metric? (e.g., “$200k pipeline/qtr”, “10 leads/month”, “3 integrations shipped”)
2) Which partnership type(s) are in scope? (platform/integration, channel/referral, strategic/co-marketing, reseller)
3) What market/ICP are we targeting (industry, buyer role, segment, geo)?
4) What can we offer partners today? (API/integration, audience, revenue share, co-marketing, credibility, data)
5) What constraints apply? (timeline, eng/marketing bandwidth, compliance, exclusivity appetite, budget)

## Deal reality checks
6) What’s our current baseline? (existing partners, pipeline sourced, inbound demand, current integrations)
7) What’s the typical deal size/cycle (if applicable) and who must approve internally?
8) Do we require an integration? If yes: what’s “minimum integration” and how many eng-weeks are available?
9) Any non-negotiables? (no exclusivity, no data sharing, only specific geos, etc.)

## Partner targeting
10) Name 5 “dream partners” and why each might care.
11) Who is the “finger-on-the-button” decision-maker at each (function + title)?
12) Do we have a warm path? (mutuals, investors, customers, communities, events)
13) Is this a network-dependent market? (regulated/concentrated buyers where intros matter more than product merit)

## Proof + leverage
14) What proof do we have? (case studies, logos, metrics, founder credibility)
15) What do we want to be true in 90 days? (signed LOIs, launched partners, sourced pipeline)
16) What leverage do we have (or can we create)? (case study angle, alpha/beta participation, unique demand)

## Safety / compliance
17) Any claims we must avoid? (regulated statements, privacy constraints, competitive constraints)
18) Who must review before we sign anything? (legal, security, exec)
