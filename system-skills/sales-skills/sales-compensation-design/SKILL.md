Sales Compensation Design  Sales compensation design is the strategic structuring of pay plans to align rep incentives with business objectives. The traditional 50/50 base-bonus split has remained unchanged for decades, but modern approaches consider long-term retention, net dollar retention, and customer success - not just closed deals.

Read Guide

The Guide  3 key steps synthesized from 2 experts.

1 Understand the standard 50/50 structure  The traditional model is 50% base salary, 50% bonus tied to quota attainment. This is the industry baseline that most reps expect. Before innovating, understand why this structure exists and what it optimizes for (new business acquisition above all else).

Featured guest perspectives

"It's usually 50/50, right? 50% base, 50% bonus for a sales rep."

— Jason M Lemkin        2 Align comp with business outcomes beyond closed deals  Modern comp plans should align rep incentives with what actually matters to the business: customer success, retention, and net dollar retention - not just initial close. The old model was built for a different era. Consider how to incent behavior that leads to long-term value, not just short-term wins.

Featured guest perspectives

"Sales comp plans are stuck in the stone ages... What we haven't done is built a modern technical sales compensation plan that actually aligns the needs and incentives of the business, the customer and the rep."

— Sahil Mansuri        3 Design ramping strategies for new hires  New sales hires need time to ramp up before they can hit full quota. Your comp plan should account for this with ramping structures that provide financial stability during the learning period while still incentivizing performance improvement.
