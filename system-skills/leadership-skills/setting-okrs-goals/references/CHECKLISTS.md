# Checklists

Use these to validate the OKR & Goals Pack before finalizing.

## A) Scope + alignment checklist
- [ ] Cycle, horizon, and team scope are explicit
- [ ] A clear strategy anchor exists (company goal / North Star / why now)
- [ ] Each team objective is **no more than one step away** from the company goal
- [ ] Non-goals are explicit (what we will not optimize/build)

## B) Objective quality checklist
- [ ] 1–3 objectives total (per team per cycle)
- [ ] Objectives are outcomes, not project lists
- [ ] “Why now” is documented
- [ ] Each objective is understandable without reading the KRs

## C) KR quality checklist (measurement + ownership)
- [ ] 2–5 KRs per objective (not 10+)
- [ ] Each KR has: definition, baseline, target, time window
- [ ] Each KR has an owner and data source (and data latency if relevant)
- [ ] Targets are ambitious enough to change behavior, but not obviously impossible

## D) Anti-gaming + metric robustness checklist
- [ ] Prefer absolute metrics over ratios/percentages
- [ ] Any ratio KR includes numerator/denominator checks or complementary absolute KRs
- [ ] Each KR includes 1–2 “how this could be gamed” notes (or explicitly “hard to game because…”)
- [ ] Guardrails exist to prevent obvious harm (quality/trust/margin/volume)

## E) Systems & habits checklist
- [ ] At least one default-on system/habit exists per objective
- [ ] Each system has a cadence + owner
- [ ] Evidence/artifacts from the system are defined (what gets captured each time)

## F) Review + grading checklist (learning loop)
- [ ] Weekly review cadence and agenda are defined
- [ ] Mid-cycle checkpoint rules are defined (what can change)
- [ ] End-of-cycle grading method and retro prompts exist
- [ ] The grading framing is explicitly for learning, not punishment

## G) Final pack checklist (must-have sections)
- [ ] Context snapshot
- [ ] Alignment map
- [ ] OKRs (objectives + KRs tables)
- [ ] Guardrails + anti-gaming notes
- [ ] Systems & habits plan
- [ ] Review + grading plan
- [ ] Risks
- [ ] Open questions
- [ ] Next steps
