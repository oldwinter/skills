# Workflow (Expanded) — Organizational Design

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance, heuristics, and common failure modes.

## Step 1 — Define what you’re optimizing for (and constraints)

Heuristics:
- Org design is a **tradeoff engine**. Make the tradeoffs explicit (speed vs coherence, autonomy vs consistency, innovation vs reliability).
- Prefer 3–5 principles over 10+. If everything is a principle, nothing is.

Common failure modes:
- Reorg as a solution to unclear strategy (“structure will fix it”).
- No success metrics (no way to tell if the change helped or hurt).

## Step 2 — Map the org as a system (dependencies + decision rights)

Heuristics:
- Most “slow” orgs are slow due to **dependency chains** and **unclear decision rights**, not because people aren’t working hard.
- Model the system as “work flows + handoffs,” not just reporting lines.

Common failure modes:
- A neat org chart that ignores how work actually moves.
- Missing approvers/constraints that appear late (rework and morale damage).

## Step 3 — Choose posture on two spectrums

### A) Centralized ↔ decentralized (Apple-like ↔ Amazon-like)

Heuristics:
- **More centralization** works when you need an integrated customer experience and consistent quality/brand decisions.
- **More decentralization** works when you can define clean interfaces and want parallel execution with fewer coordination meetings.

Failure modes:
- Decentralizing without interfaces/standards → fragmentation and duplicated work.
- Centralizing without capacity → bottlenecks and slow decisions.

### B) Functional ↔ divisional/value-stream

Heuristics:
- **Functional** alignment (e.g., product/eng/design organized by discipline) can improve craft consistency and reduce “mini-companies,” especially when you need to “go back to startup” and simplify.
- **Divisional/value-stream** alignment can improve end-to-end ownership and speed for distinct products/journeys, if you can keep standards and shared platforms healthy.

Failure modes:
- Switching models without changing decision rights and operating cadence (nothing improves).

## Step 4 — Create multiple options

Heuristics:
- Always generate at least two options, otherwise you’re not designing—you’re rationalizing.
- Every option should explicitly answer:
  - “What dependencies are removed?”
  - “What decisions move closer to the work?”
  - “What stays standardized vs varies?”

Common failure modes:
- “Hybrid” that’s actually ambiguity (no one knows who decides).

## Step 5 — Decide with a score + narrative

Heuristics:
- Use the rubric as a forcing function, then write the decision narrative (“why this option, why now, why not the others?”).
- Pick a fallback option in case a key assumption fails (e.g., talent maturity, architecture constraints).

Common failure modes:
- Decision made by politics; no explicit rationale; later re-litigated.

## Step 6 — Transition plan (sequence + safety rails)

Heuristics:
- Minimize “Day 1 churn”: change structure and decision rights, but keep in-flight work continuity.
- Define “Day 1 operating model”: who decides, what meetings exist, and where truth lives.
- Prefer pilots when uncertainty is high; avoid serial reorgs.

Common failure modes:
- Big-bang change with unclear interim ownership (work stalls).
- No comms plan; rumor fills the gap.

## Step 7 — Quality gate and iteration

Heuristics:
- If the rubric is low, do one more small intake round and revise; don’t ship a shaky reorg plan.
- Explicitly list Risks/Open questions/Next steps so stakeholders know what’s still uncertain.
