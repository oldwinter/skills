# Source Summary — Organizational Design (Refound/Lenny)

This skill pack was derived from the Refound/Lenny skill: `sources/refound/raw/organizational-design/SKILL.md`.

The source is primarily **insights**. This pack operationalizes those insights into rules, checks, and reusable artifacts.

## What was preserved (key insights → operational rules)

### “Go back to a startup” via functional alignment + fewer layers (Brian Chesky)
- **Rule:** When speed and craft consistency are suffering, consider shifting toward a more **functional** model and simplifying management layers.
- **Rule:** Avoid “people managers” who don’t know the work; make leadership roles accountable for outcomes and craft (not just process).
- **In pack:** Operating Model Decision template + management/layer checks in `references/CHECKLISTS.md` and `references/RUBRIC.md`.

### Centralized ↔ decentralized spectrum (Gustav Söderström)
- **Rule:** Choose a deliberate posture on the centralization spectrum: centralize when integrated UX/quality decisions must be coherent; decentralize when minimizing dependencies enables parallel execution.
- **Rule:** Decentralization requires interfaces/standards; centralization requires capacity to avoid bottlenecks.
- **In pack:** Two-spectrum model in Workflow Step 3 + guardrails templates + dependency checklist.

## What was added (to make it agent-executable)
- A concrete **Organizational Design Pack** output contract (what to produce, in what order).
- Templates for brief, current-state map, operating model decision, options, scorecard, operating mechanisms, and transition plan.
- A checklist + rubric so the output is testable and repeatable.
