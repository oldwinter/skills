# Examples

**Example 1 (resource allocation):** “Should we invest in SEO or paid acquisition for the next 2 quarters? Build a trade-off pack with all-in cost, ROI speed, and assumptions.”  
Expected: all-in cost vs alternatives, order-of-magnitude impact ranges, and a clear recommendation + review date.

**Example 2 (speed vs quality):** “We can ship v1 next week with rough edges or delay 3 weeks to ship ‘noteworthy’. Evaluate the trade-off and propose a worse-first mitigation plan if we ship now.”  
Expected: explicit criteria/guardrails (trust/support load), dip plan, and stop/continue triggers if metrics degrade.

**Boundary example:** “Help me decide if I should leave my job.”  
Response: this skill is for organizational/product leadership trade-offs; suggest a personal decision framework or coach instead.
