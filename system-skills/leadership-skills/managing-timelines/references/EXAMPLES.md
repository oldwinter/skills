# Examples

**Example 1 (fixed external date):** “We’re launching at an industry event on May 15. Create a milestone plan, RAG cadence, and a comms template for Sales/Marketing/Execs.”  
Expected: a fixed-deadline plan that treats the date as P0, with change control and clear escalation triggers.

**Example 2 (AI uneven cadence):** “We can demo an AI support agent in 2 weeks, but production will be risky. Build a plan that separates first demo vs production-ready and sets expectations.”  
Expected: milestones that include evaluation, safety/reliability, and rollout steps; explicit commit vs forecast language.

**Boundary example:** “Decide what we should build this quarter and set dates for everything.”  
Response: use `prioritizing-roadmap` first; then apply this skill to the chosen initiative(s).
