# Checklists (Planning Under Uncertainty)

Use these before finalizing the Uncertainty Planning Pack.

## 1) Decision frame checklist
- Objective and “why now” are stated in 1–2 sentences.
- Mode is explicit (wartime vs peacetime) and fits urgency.
- Success metrics and guardrails are defined.
- Decision owner(s) for stop/pivot/scale are named.
- Constraints and what can flex (scope/time/resources/quality/segment) are explicit.

## 2) Uncertainty map checklist
- Top unknowns/assumptions are captured (not just a vague “lots of uncertainty”).
- Each unknown has confidence and impact ratings.
- The top 5 unknowns are prioritized by “impact × uncertainty”.
- Every top unknown has a validation method, owner, and time bound.

## 3) Hypotheses checklist
- Hypotheses are falsifiable and tied to a mechanism (“because…”).
- Each hypothesis links to a decision (stop/pivot/scale/commit).
- “Winning” is defined as learning that changes a decision (not win rate).
- Guardrails exist to prevent local optimization.

## 4) Experiments checklist
- Each experiment has: owner, segment/sample, duration, and expected learning.
- The portfolio includes at least one fast test (days) and one higher-confidence test (weeks) if needed.
- The tests are sized appropriately to stakes (higher stakes → stronger evidence).
- There is a clear plan for what happens when results are ambiguous.

## 5) Data-as-compass checklist
- Primary signals are directional and update quickly (leading indicators).
- You have “ridiculousness tests” to quickly disprove bad assumptions.
- Metrics are interpreted with context (segment, confounders, seasonality).
- You avoid false precision (don’t pretend data can “tell you what to do”).

## 6) Buffers + contingencies checklist
- Buffers are explicit (time/capacity/budget) and proportional to uncertainty.
- Contingency plans (A/B/C) exist for the top risks/unknowns.
- Triggers are written as “if X then Y” with thresholds and deadlines.
- Rollback/escalation paths are defined in wartime scenarios.

## 7) Cadence + comms checklist
- A learning/decision cadence is defined (weekly default; faster in crisis).
- A short review agenda exists and can run repeatedly.
- Stakeholder update template includes: what changed, what was learned, decisions needed, next tests.
- A decision log location is specified.

## 8) Finalization checklist
- The pack includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, and **Next steps** with owners + time bounds.
- A stakeholder could approve the plan async (it’s specific and unambiguous).
