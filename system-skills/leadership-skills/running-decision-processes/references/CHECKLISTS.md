# Checklists — Running Decision Processes

Use these checklists before finalizing the Decision Process Pack and at key moments during execution.

## A) Decision Process Pack quality checklist (pre-flight)
- Decision statement is one sentence and includes a deadline.
- One-way door vs two-way door classification is explicit.
- Constraints/non-negotiables are listed (policy/security, budget, timeline, customer promises).
- Options set is 2–4 real options (not strawmen); tradeoffs are visible.
- Evaluation criteria reflect real tradeoffs (not a wish list).
- Key assumptions/unknowns are explicit and testable.
- Decision rights are explicit (one Decider or a defined body); veto power is explicit.
- Consultation plan exists (who is consulted, by when) and is lightweight enough to execute.
- Decision log entry includes rationale, tradeoffs, owner, and review date.
- Communication draft states what changes now, who owns next steps, and when we’ll review.
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps are included.

## B) Anti-hesitation checklist
- The team is not waiting for “perfect data” when the decision is fundamentally ambiguous.
- The decision is framed as a tradeoff, not as “finding the perfect answer.”
- A clear “default if we do nothing” is stated (and why it’s unacceptable or acceptable).
- The Decider is willing to choose between imperfect options and own the outcome.

## C) Explicit assumptions checklist (Annie Duke test)
- Assumptions are written as statements that could be proven wrong.
- Each major assumption has a plan to test/observe it (metric, leading indicator, pilot).
- A review date is set to check assumptions vs reality.

## D) Curiosity loop checklist
- Ask is lightweight (2–3 prompts; “pick top 2 and why”).
- The consult list includes experts + context-aware peers (not only friends).
- Inputs capture “why” and evidence; disagreements are recorded.

## E) Post-decision follow-through checklist
- Decision is communicated to everyone who needs to execute (not just attendees).
- Owner and first 2–3 milestones are named.
- Review date and metrics are scheduled (calendar + doc link).
- A short retrospective is planned to capture learning and update templates.
