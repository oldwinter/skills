# Source Summary — Running Decision Processes (Refound/Lenny)

This skill pack was derived from the Refound/Lenny skill: `sources/refound/raw/running-decision-processes/SKILL.md`.

## What was preserved (key insights → operational rules)

### “Don’t hesitate” (Ben Horowitz)
- **Rule:** When options are bad, make the decision explicit and timeboxed; name the tradeoff and commit.
- **In pack:** Step 2 (anti-hesitation framing) + Anti-hesitation checklist.

### “Make implicit → explicit” (Annie Duke)
- **Rule:** Write down assumptions behind intuition so you can learn when you were wrong/right.
- **In pack:** Step 4 (assumptions log) + Explicit assumptions checklist + review loop template.

### “Curiosity loop” (Ada Chen Rekhi)
- **Rule:** Seek contextual advice from a curated set using lightweight, rationale-seeking prompts.
- **In pack:** Step 6 + Curiosity Loop outreach template + checklist.

### “Be a historian” (Anneka Gupta)
- **Rule:** Reconstruct past decisions and baggage to avoid repeating mistakes and late-stage vetoes.
- **In pack:** Step 3 + Historian interview prompts + workflow guidance.

### “High-conviction choices under ambiguity” (Brandon Chu)
- **Rule:** Some decisions can’t be solved with data; leaders must choose, own it, and create accountability.
- **In pack:** Step 7 (decide + commit) + decision log requirements (owner, tradeoffs, review date).

## What was added (to make it agent-executable)
- A concrete **Decision Process Pack** output contract with copy/paste templates.
- A step-by-step workflow with checks, plus checklists and a scoring rubric to make quality testable.
