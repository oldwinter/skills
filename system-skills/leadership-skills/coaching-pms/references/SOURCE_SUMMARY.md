# Source Summary — Coaching PMs (Refound/Lenny)

This skill pack was derived from the Refound/Lenny skill: `sources/refound/raw/coaching-pms/SKILL.md`.

## What was preserved (key insights → operational rules)

### Bloom’s Taxonomy for diagnosis and leveling (Bangaly Kaba)
- **Rule:** Use an explicit “thinking depth” ladder (e.g., Bloom’s) to diagnose skill depth and choose the right reps.
- **In pack:** Competency model template includes a Bloom depth ladder; development plan uses Bloom-driven rep design.

### Coaching is the primary job of product leadership (Marty Cagan)
- **Rule:** Treat coaching as a scalable leadership responsibility; build repeatable coaching systems (cadence + artifacts).
- **In pack:** Output contract includes coaching cadence + session toolkit + follow-up tracker.

### 5-step PM development framework (Petra Wille)
- **Rule:** Develop PMs via: (1) define “good PM” in-context, (2) assess current state, (3) align on shared vision, (4) create a development plan, (5) follow up.
- **In pack:** Workflow steps 2–7 and templates directly implement this sequence.

## What was added (to make it agent-executable)
- A concrete **PM Coaching Pack** output contract (definition → assessment → growth bets → plan → cadence → tracker).
- Templates, checklists, and a scoring rubric to make quality repeatable and testable.
