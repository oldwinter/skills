# Examples — Coaching PMs

Use these as reference patterns. Adapt to your org, level, and constraints.

## Example A — Mid-level PM: “move from shipping to choosing better bets”

**Context:** Growth team, weekly releases. PM ships reliably but struggles to frame the right problems and make crisp tradeoffs.

**Growth bets (2):**
1) Problem framing & insight (Apply → Analyze)
2) Strategy & prioritization (Apply → Analyze)

**Weekly reps (samples):**
- Write a 1-page opportunity assessment for one funnel drop-off (problem, evidence, segments, options, tradeoffs, recommendation).
- Create a “decision brief” for one prioritization call with 2 options + rejected alternatives.

**Stretch assignment:**
- Own an 8-week initiative with a clear hypothesis; run weekly decision briefs; present a mid-point tradeoff review.

## Example B — Senior PM: “exec comms + cross-functional alignment”

**Context:** Platform roadmap. PM has strong technical depth but creates friction with stakeholders and struggles with narrative clarity.

**Growth bets (2):**
1) Stakeholder leadership (Apply → Analyze)
2) Product craft (narrative + decision docs) (Apply → Analyze)

**Weekly reps (samples):**
- Pre-read for each major decision: context, options, tradeoffs, recommendation, asks.
- Stakeholder map update: incentives, risks, alignment plan, comms plan.

## Boundary example — “turn this into a PIP”

If the user requests HR/performance documentation:
- Recommend following company HR process.
- Offer only coaching-adjacent outputs (expectations doc + development plan) labeled explicitly as non-HR.
