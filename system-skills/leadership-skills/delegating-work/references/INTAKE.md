# Intake (Delegating Work)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What are you delegating?** (project/problem/decision) What’s the “why now”?
2) **What does “done” look like?** Output artifact(s), success metrics, acceptance criteria, and the quality bar.
3) **What are the non-negotiables?** Timeline, budget, policies/compliance, customer impact, stakeholders to involve.
4) **Who is the owner?** Their role/seniority, current workload, and development goals (if relevant).
5) **What autonomy level do you want?** (e.g., “propose + I approve” vs “you decide, inform me”) Any escalation triggers you already know?

## Context + constraints (as needed)
- What background/docs/links exist? Prior decisions, requirements, metrics, user/customer context.
- What dependencies exist? Other teams, vendors, data access, approvals.
- What risks are you worried about? (quality, safety, security, reputation, cost overruns)
- What decisions are reserved for you or leadership?

## Cadence preferences (optional)
- Desired check-in cadence (daily/2x week/weekly) and medium (1:1, Slack, doc updates)
- Preferred update format (bullets, dashboard, weekly memo)
- Who else needs visibility? (stakeholders, execs, partner teams)

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A clearly stated assumed outcome + definition of done
- A conservative guardrails set + explicit escalation triggers
- A lightweight cadence and review plan that emphasizes artifacts and decisions
- A list of unknowns and the first 3 questions the owner should answer in week 1
