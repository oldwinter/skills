# Checklists

## A) Golden Ritual quality (Named / Templated / Known)
- [ ] Golden Ritual list is small (3–7), and each ritual has a crisp purpose
- [ ] Every ritual is **Named** (people can reference it in conversation)
- [ ] Every ritual is **Templated** (agenda/notes format exists and is easy to reuse)
- [ ] Rituals are **Known by first Friday** (onboarding primer exists and is discoverable)

## B) System design (minimal, outcome-driven)
- [ ] Rituals map to explicit outcomes (alignment, decisions, execution, learning, belonging)
- [ ] Total sync time fits within the team’s meeting time budget
- [ ] Each ritual has an owner/facilitator responsible for prep and outputs
- [ ] Each ritual has an explicit artifact output (decisions, priorities, action list, learnings)
- [ ] Status-only meetings are replaced with async updates where feasible

## C) Template quality (run-ability)
- [ ] Agenda is timeboxed and includes required prework
- [ ] Outputs are explicit (what gets written, where it lives, and who follows up)
- [ ] Decision rules are clear (who decides, how to escalate)
- [ ] Anti-patterns are listed with fixes
- [ ] Async fallback exists (how non-attendees participate and stay informed)

## D) Rollout + onboarding readiness
- [ ] Rollout plan includes pilot, feedback collection, and iteration
- [ ] Calendars/docs are created and linked from a single “ritual index”
- [ ] New hires can find templates quickly and understand how to prepare

## E) Governance (avoid ritual sprawl)
- [ ] A quarterly ritual review is scheduled with a keep/change/kill decision rule
- [ ] Feedback loop exists (monthly pulse or equivalent)
- [ ] Retirement path exists (how rituals get removed without confusion)

## F) Final pack completeness
- [ ] Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**
- [ ] Assumptions are labeled; missing info is listed
- [ ] The system is adoptable for the team’s size and maturity (not over-processed)
