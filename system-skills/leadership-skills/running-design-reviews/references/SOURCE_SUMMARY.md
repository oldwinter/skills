# Source Summary

Source: `sources/refound/raw/running-design-reviews/SKILL.md`

The provided source skill contained “Top Insights” from multiple design/product leaders and a reference to a deeper file (`references/guest-insights.md`) that was not present in the raw source folder. This skill pack therefore operationalizes the insights that were present and adds missing execution layers: contracts, workflow, templates, and quality gates.

## Preserved insights → operational rules

### 1) Prioritize feedback by Value → Ease → Delight (Julie Zhuo)
- **Rule:** Do not spend time on aesthetics/minutiae until the design’s value and ease-of-use are validated.
- **Checks:** Feedback log categories are used; “Delight” is deferred if Value/Ease is unresolved.
- **Artifacts:** Feedback log + agenda structure that enforces the hierarchy.

### 2) Assign a Sponsor/DRI and use live demos (Karri Saarinen)
- **Rule:** Every major project has a sponsor/DRI who focuses on “why” and the core concept, and reviews happen via live demos when possible.
- **Checks:** Roles are named; agenda includes a demo walkthrough.
- **Artifacts:** Brief lists sponsor; agenda + facilitation script.

### 3) Maintain a high quality bar with senior review for shipped screens (Dmitry Zlokazov)
- **Rule:** For high-craft products/areas, require a ship gate where a senior owner reviews all user-facing screens and key states.
- **Checks:** Ship-readiness review type is available; outcomes include a next gate.
- **Artifacts:** Decision record + follow-up plan including final review gate.

### 4) Structure feedback requests around risks/tradeoffs (Geoff Charles)
- **Rule:** Presenters must ask for specific types of feedback and explicitly surface risks/tradeoffs.
- **Checks:** Brief includes requested feedback questions and risks/tradeoffs.
- **Artifacts:** Design review brief template.

### 5) Start big-picture before minutiae (Jessica Hische)
- **Rule:** Begin critiques with overall goals/feelings (“what’s bothering me?”) before pixel-level comments.
- **Checks:** Facilitation prompts start with big-picture and move to details.
- **Artifacts:** Agenda script + checklist.
