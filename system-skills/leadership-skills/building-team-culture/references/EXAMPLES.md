# Examples

**Example 1 (new leader, listen-first):** “I’m a new Head of Product joining a remote team of 14. Culture feels low-trust and decisions are slow. Create a culture snapshot, a culture code, and explicit decision-making + meeting norms. Include a 30/60/90 rollout and measurement plan.”  
Expected: full pack with clear norms and rituals; no generic values.

**Example 2 (scaling + coaching culture):** “We’re growing from 8 → 25. I want to preserve high ownership while adding more coordination. Draft a culture code and a coaching model, plus rituals that keep ambition and creativity high.”  
Expected: principles + behaviors, coaching model, rituals/cadence map.

**Boundary example:** “We have a harassment complaint and need to ‘fix our culture’ immediately.”  
Response: direct to HR/legal for investigation and safety; offer to help later with culture articulation, norms, and reinforcement once appropriate.
