# Checklists (Quality Gates)

Use these checklists before finalizing the pack.

## A) Pack completeness (must pass)
- [ ] Includes **culture snapshot** with examples (not just opinions)
- [ ] Includes **culture code** with 3–7 principles and behavior-level “do/don’t”
- [ ] Includes **decision rules** (how decisions get made + documented)
- [ ] Includes **team norms** (communication, meetings, feedback/conflict)
- [ ] Includes **rituals/cadence map** with owners and outputs
- [ ] Includes **rollout + reinforcement** plan (not just “announce the doc”)
- [ ] Includes **measurement** (leading indicators + pulse questions)
- [ ] Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**

## B) Culture code quality
- [ ] Principles are specific (not generic “be excellent”)
- [ ] Each principle has 2–5 concrete behaviors and at least 1 anti-pattern
- [ ] “Culture fit” is defined as observable behavior (not personality or background)
- [ ] Principles translate into day-to-day decision rules (tradeoffs are explicit)

## C) Norms + rituals quality
- [ ] Norms address common failure modes (slow decisions, meeting bloat, unclear ownership)
- [ ] Rituals reinforce principles (each ritual maps to at least one principle)
- [ ] Each ritual has a clear owner and a written output
- [ ] The plan respects time budget (defaults are lightweight)

## D) Psychological safety + learning
- [ ] Includes at least 2 concrete safety practices (e.g., blameless retro, structured disagreement norms)
- [ ] Leaders’ behaviors are specified (modeling, acknowledging mistakes, inviting dissent)
- [ ] Feedback norms include repair (what happens after conflict)

## E) Rollout readiness
- [ ] Starts with listening / diagnosis before heavy change
- [ ] Proposes 1–2 pilots (smallest experiments) instead of a big-bang rollout
- [ ] Assigns responsibilities (DRI/owner) for each reinforcement mechanism
- [ ] Includes at least one “visible progress” ritual to counter stagnation
