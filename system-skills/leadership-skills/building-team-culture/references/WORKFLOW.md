# Expanded Workflow: Building Team Culture

This file expands the workflow in `SKILL.md` with practical heuristics and copy/paste building blocks.

## Principles to follow (rules + checks)

### 1) Articulate before you invent
- **Rule:** Start by describing the culture that already exists (what it rewards/punishes), then decide what to keep/change.
- **Check:** Can the team recognize themselves in the “culture snapshot” without feeling caricatured?

### 2) Listen first when you’re new
- **Rule:** When joining a new team, prioritize listening over “coming in swinging.”
- **Check:** You can cite 5–10 concrete examples from the team’s lived experience before proposing changes.

### 3) Culture is a decision-making system
- **Rule:** Values must translate into decision rules people use when the boss isn’t around.
- **Check:** For each principle, you can answer: “What decision does this change?”

### 4) Stagnation often looks like ‘nothing changes’
- **Rule:** Maintain visible progress and creative ambition; remove sacred cows that block evolution.
- **Check:** Your rituals include a recurring “progress visible” moment (demo, shipping review, customer-impact review).

### 5) Reinforce via coaching, not policing
- **Rule:** Prefer a coaching model (skill development + growth path) over pure compliance.
- **Check:** The rollout plan includes who coaches whom, and how feedback is practiced.

## Step-by-step guidance

### Step 2: Culture snapshot (what to capture)
Capture these in 1–2 pages:
- **Stated culture:** what leadership says matters (values, principles, slogans)
- **Lived culture:** what gets rewarded/punished in practice
- **Decision patterns:** how decisions are made (by data, by hierarchy, by loudest voice, by consensus)
- **Conflict patterns:** how disagreement works (avoidance, escalation, productive debate)
- **Ownership:** where responsibility is clear vs fuzzy
- **Psych safety signals:** who speaks, who stays silent, what happens after mistakes
- **Sacred cows:** taboos/untouchables that constrain progress

Optional: propose a “listening tour” plan (2 weeks)
- 30–45 min 1:1s across roles/levels (or small-group listening sessions)
- Use 6–8 core questions (see “Listening prompts” below)
- Synthesize themes without naming individuals (protect safety)

Listening prompts (copy/paste)
1) “What’s the best part of working on this team?”
2) “When have you felt proud of our work? What enabled it?”
3) “When do we move too slowly? Why?”
4) “What’s hard to say out loud here?”
5) “What behaviors get rewarded (explicitly or implicitly)?”
6) “What should we stop doing immediately?”
7) “If you led this team, what 1–2 changes would you make first?”

### Step 3: Diagnose focus areas
Pick **2–4** focus areas max. Common ones:
- Decision speed and clarity
- Feedback quality and conflict norms
- Ownership/accountability
- Ambition/creativity/customer obsession (countering stagnation)
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Psychological safety + learning from mistakes

For each focus area:
- Current pattern (with examples)
- Root causes (structure, incentives, norms, leadership behavior)
- New behaviors to reinforce (specific)
- Leading indicators (observable within weeks)

### Step 4: Culture code v1 (how to write principles)
Keep to **3–7** principles. For each include:
- **Principle name** (short and memorable)
- **Definition** (what we mean)
- **Do / Don’t** (behavioral)
- **Decision rules** (what to do in common dilemmas)
- **Anti-patterns** (what this is not)
- **Signals** (what you’ll see in a healthy version of this principle)

### Step 5: Norms + rituals that reinforce principles
Design norms for:
- **Communication:** async vs sync, response expectations, documentation
- **Meetings:** default agendas, facilitation, “no surprises”, decision capture
- **Decisions:** DACI/RAPID/DRI, disagree-and-commit, escalation
- **Feedback & conflict:** how to challenge, how to give feedback, repair after conflict

Design rituals using this structure:
- Ritual name
- Purpose (which principle it reinforces)
- Cadence + duration
- Owner/facilitator
- Participants
- Standard agenda
- Outputs (what gets written down)

### Step 6: Rollout + reinforcement plan
Use multiple reinforcement channels:
- Onboarding: teach principles + norms in week 1
- Hiring: interview signals aligned to principles (avoid vague “culture fit”)
- Coaching: peer/craft coaches, regular growth conversations
- Recognition: reward behaviors, not just outcomes
- Moments: offsite, planning cycle, retros, launch reviews

Measurement ideas (lightweight)
- Pulse questions (monthly) on safety, clarity, ownership, decision speed
- Ritual adherence (are we actually doing the rituals?)
- Qualitative examples (two “wins” and one “miss” per month)
