# WORKFLOW (Expanded)

This file expands `../SKILL.md` with heuristics, branching logic, and meeting hygiene practices.

## 1) First decision: meeting vs async

Default stance: **if it’s not discussion, don’t meet.**

Use a meeting when you need at least one of:
- Real-time debate on trade-offs / objections
- Fast clarification across functions
- Live negotiation of constraints and commitments

Prefer async when you only need:
- Status updates
- Broadcasting a decision
- Collecting ideas without interaction (use a doc/form first)

## 2) Pick the meeting format (separate operational vs strategic)

**Operational meeting (high structure)**
- Purpose: track priority work, surface blockers, assign owners
- Format: tight agenda, timeboxed updates, clear “off-ramp” for deep dives
- Output: action items + blockers + owner/due dates

**Strategic discussion (more open)**
- Purpose: explore direction, evaluate hypotheses, align on principles
- Format: fewer topics, more discussion time, explicit parking lot
- Output: decisions made (or what evidence is needed) + next steps

Heuristic: If your weekly meeting keeps mixing both, split it into two meetings.

**Decision meeting**
- Purpose: pressure-test options and record a decision
- Requirements: decision owner present; pre-read with options + recommendation
- Output: decision record + rationale + follow-up actions

**Workshop (single-session)**
- Purpose: generate outputs collaboratively (e.g., risks list, plan, options)
- Format: scripted exercises, artifacts per exercise, strong timekeeping
- Output: compiled artifact(s) and a clear handoff

If the problem is big and cross-functional with lots of unknowns, consider a multi-day workshop (out of scope for this skill pack’s default workflow).

## 3) Use “Discover / Discuss / Decide”

Many meetings fail because they try to do all 3 live:
- **Discover:** share context, data, options
- **Discuss:** debate, clarify, stress-test
- **Decide:** choose, commit, record

Rule of thumb:
- Discover happens **before** the meeting (pre-read + async comments)
- Discuss happens **in** the meeting
- Decide happens **immediately after** discussion, captured explicitly

## 4) Prime the room (avoid “cold start” meetings)

Start every meeting by stating:
- Objective and desired output
- Meeting type (“This is an operational sync” / “This is a decision meeting”)
- Decision rights (“X decides after hearing input”)
- Conversation mode (creative problem solving vs tactical efficiency)
- Ground rules (timeboxing, parking lot, note capture)

This reduces derailments and “wait—why are we here?” moments.

## 5) Agenda design rules

- Cap at **1–3 topics** per meeting.
- Design for **discussion time** (not live reading).
- Add an “expected output” per segment: decision, list, owner, next step.
- Add explicit “deep dive off-ramp”: if a topic needs 30+ minutes, park it and schedule a follow-up with the right subset.

## 6) Closing alignment (prevent re-meetings)

End with these three questions (and write the answers):
1) What did we decide?
2) Who needs to do what by when?
3) Who else needs to know?

If you can’t answer #1, the meeting outcome is “no decision” — record what evidence is needed and by when.

## 7) Follow-up rules

Within 24 hours:
- Send decisions + action items + owners + due dates
- Link to notes and the decision record
- Name “who else needs to know” and assign an owner to inform them

Within 1–2 weeks (for recurring meetings):
- Audit: does this meeting still earn its calendar time?
- Kill, shorten, or split meetings that drift
