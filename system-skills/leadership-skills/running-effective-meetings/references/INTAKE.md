# INTAKE (Question Bank)

Ask up to 5 questions at a time. If the user can’t answer, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum questions (pick 3–5)
1) What is the meeting’s **objective** and what must be true when it ends?
2) Is this an **operational**, **strategic discussion**, **decision**, or **workshop** meeting (or should I recommend)?
3) What **decision(s)** (if any) must be made, and who is the **decision owner**?
4) Who must attend, and what role does each person play (input, approver, implementer, informed)?
5) What is the **time box** (30/45/60/90 min) and is it remote/hybrid?

## Helpful follow-ups (ask only if needed)
- What context exists already (doc links, metrics, constraints, prior decisions)?
- What are the top 1–3 discussion questions or tensions?
- What pre-work can attendees do asynchronously (read, comment, propose)?
- What is the expected output: decision, plan, list of options, risks, owners?
- Any meeting anti-patterns to avoid (too many topics, bikeshedding, no owner, status drift)?
- Who else needs to know the outcome (stakeholders to inform)?

## If the user provides almost nothing
Use these defaults (and mark them as assumptions):
- Meeting type: **decision meeting** (if choice is implied) else **strategic discussion**
- Time box: **60 minutes**
- Roles: facilitator + note-taker + decision owner + timekeeper
- Pre-read: 1 page max (context, options, open questions)
