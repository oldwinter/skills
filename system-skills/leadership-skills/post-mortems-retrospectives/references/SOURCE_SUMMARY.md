# Source summary (what was preserved)

Source file: `sources/refound/raw/post-mortems-retrospectives/SKILL.md`

This skill pack turns the source’s “insight bullets” into an execution contract: templates, workflow steps, and quality gates.

## Preserved insights → rules/checks/artifacts

### 1) Pre-mortems need kill criteria (Annie Duke)
- **Rule:** If you do a pre-mortem or risk review, define observable **kill/pivot criteria** and pre-commit to actions.
- **Where in this pack:** `../SKILL.md` Step 6; templates in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md) (Kill criteria / triggers).
- **Check:** Every trigger has a committed action (not “we’ll discuss it”).

### 2) Reframe “postmortem” as “retrospective” (Eeke de Milliano)
- **Rule:** Use language that signals learning and reduces blame.
- **Where in this pack:** `../SKILL.md` Step 1; expanded guidance in [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md).
- **Check:** Ground rules are blameless; the document avoids individual blame language.

### 3) Institutionalize learnings reviews (Ben Williams)
- **Rule:** Create a recurring ritual that socializes learnings beyond the team.
- **Where in this pack:** `../SKILL.md` Step 7; dissemination templates in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md) (Impact & Learnings Review).
- **Check:** There is an owner, cadence, and input format for the learning review.

### 4) Treat failures as learning opportunities (Carole Robin)
- **Rule:** Explicitly ask “What did we learn?” and capture learnings as decisions and actions.
- **Where in this pack:** `../SKILL.md` Steps 4–5; checklist items in [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md).
- **Check:** The output includes 3–7 learnings and they map to decisions/actions.

### 5) Focus on the “why” behind OKR grades (Christina Wodtke)
- **Rule:** Keep grades secondary; focus on system causes and what changes next.
- **Where in this pack:** `../SKILL.md` Step 4; expanded guidance in [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md).
- **Check:** The retro doc includes blockers/root conditions and concrete decisions for the next cycle.

## Notes / gaps
- The source description references “11 leaders / 13 insights”, but the provided source snapshot contains 5 excerpts. This pack preserves those excerpts and fills execution details (workflow, templates, checklists) that were not present in the source.
