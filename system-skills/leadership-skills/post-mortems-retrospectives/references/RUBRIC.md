# Rubric (score 1–5)

Score the draft across categories. A “pass” requires:
- No category below **3**
- Average score **≥ 4.0**

## 1) Clarity of scope and safety
1: Goal unclear; blame framing; roles missing  
3: Goal and roles exist; mostly blameless; some ambiguity  
5: Goal and audience are crisp; explicit blameless norms; roles and constraints are clear

## 2) Evidence and timeline quality
1: Hand-wavy story; no timestamps or sources  
3: Partial timeline; some evidence; facts/hypotheses mixed  
5: Clear timeline with timestamps and links; facts vs hypotheses explicitly separated

## 3) Systems thinking (contributing factors)
1: Individual blame or single-point cause  
3: Some systems factors; shallow clustering  
5: Multi-factor systems view; “why it made sense” captured; changeable conditions identified

## 4) Decisions and actionability
1: Vague recommendations; no owners/dates  
3: Some actions with owners; weak success signals  
5: Concrete decisions; action tracker with owners, due dates, success signals, and follow-up cadence

## 5) Learning dissemination and institutionalization
1: No shareout; learning stays local  
3: Shareout exists but lacks cadence/ownership  
5: Clear 1-page shareout + recurring “Impact & Learnings” review with owner and inputs

## 6) Kill criteria / triggers (if applicable)
1: Triggers absent or meaningless (“discuss later”)  
3: Some triggers but unclear thresholds or actions  
5: Observable signals with thresholds and pre-committed actions; ownership is clear
