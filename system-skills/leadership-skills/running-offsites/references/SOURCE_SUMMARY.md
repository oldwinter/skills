# Source Summary — Running Offsites (Refound/Lenny)

This skill pack converts the original “Running Offsites” insights into an execution contract with runnable artifacts.

## Preserved insights → rules/requirements

### 1) Remote-first “bursts” for high-velocity creative work (Brandon Chu)
- Rule: Use short, high-intensity in-person bursts (often quarterly) for work that’s hard async.
- Requirement: Include a repeatable logistics process (“make it frictionless”) and a default burst agenda.
- Where it shows up: `references/WORKFLOW.md` (burst guidance) + `references/TEMPLATES.md` (Burst Program Plan) + SKILL workflow step 3/7.

### 2) Offsites create space and imprint collective memory (Claire Hughes Johnson)
- Rule: Offsites must remove people from day-to-day and end with durable memory artifacts.
- Requirement: Include distraction controls (e.g., laptops down) and a “memory artifact” + checkpoint plan.
- Where it shows up: `references/WORKFLOW.md` (design rules) + SKILL steps 5 and 8 + `references/TEMPLATES.md` (memory artifact options).

### 3) Don’t use a soft-skills workshop to paper over real conflict (Donna Lichaw)
- Rule: If trust/conflict is the blocker, address it directly (or escalate) before “storytelling” or influence workshops.
- Requirement: Include an explicit conflict/trust risk check and boundaries.
- Where it shows up: SKILL scope “When NOT to use” + intake questions + workflow step 1.

### 4) Defrag the day; use physical collaboration tools (John Mark Nickels)
- Rule: Strategic work benefits from laptops down and physical collaboration (whiteboards, stickies).
- Requirement: Agenda + facilitation guide must specify laptops-down blocks and the scribe pattern.
- Where it shows up: SKILL steps 3/4/6 + facilitation template + rubric item 5.

### 5) Connection before strategy; use internal experts for skill-building (Megan Cook)
- Rule: Start with connection and include optional skill-building workshops led by internal experts.
- Requirement: Agenda must include connection time and (optionally) a workshop block.
- Where it shows up: `references/WORKFLOW.md` session library + agenda checklist + SKILL step 4.
