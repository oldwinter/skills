# Running Offsites — Expanded Workflow

Use this alongside `SKILL.md` to design an offsite that produces durable alignment and follow-through.

## Core design rules (derived from the source skill)

1) **Create space**: remove people from day-to-day (or simulate it with laptops-down rules and timeboxed comms breaks).
2) **Imprint memory**: end with a tangible “memory artifact” (1-page narrative, principles, photos of boards + summary) plus a follow-up checkpoint.
3) **Fix the real problem**: if trust/conflict is the blocker, don’t hide behind a soft-skills workshop.
4) **Defrag the day**: for strategic work, prefer physical collaboration (whiteboards, stickies) and ban multitasking.
5) **Connection before strategy**: start with human connection so disagreement later is productive.
6) **Make logistics frictionless**: remote-first teams benefit from repeatable “bursts” with low ops overhead.

## Session pattern library (pick 3–6)

### 1) Context alignment (30–60 min)
- Output: shared “current state” bullets + constraints list
- Format: silent read of pre-read, then structured Q&A

### 2) North Star + success definition (45–75 min)
- Output: success measures + non-goals
- Format: small-group draft → merge → vote

### 3) Strategy bets / priorities (90–150 min)
- Output: 3–5 bets with rationale + anti-bets
- Format: divergence (ideas) → convergence (criteria + vote) → commit (owners)

### 4) Decision principles (45–60 min)
- Output: 5–9 principles the team will use to make tradeoffs
- Format: examples → extract principles → test against scenarios

### 5) Working agreements (45–75 min)
- Output: explicit norms (decision-making, comms, escalation)
- Format: “start/stop/continue” + negotiation

### 6) Skill share / internal expert workshop (45–90 min)
- Output: a shared method + template (e.g., growth hypothesis format)
- Format: internal expert teaches; teams practice with real work

### 7) Retro + reset (45–90 min)
- Output: top 3 fixes + owners + timeline
- Format: retro prompts + dot voting

## Facilitation defaults

- **Laptops down** during co-creation blocks. If laptops are required (e.g., docs), use a single “scribe” pattern.
- Use **physical artifacts** when possible: whiteboards, stickies, printed agendas.
- Build in breaks: 10 min every 60–90 min; a longer break mid-day.
- Use a “parking lot” list for off-topic items; assign owners during close.
- Decision capture: every decision has (a) statement, (b) rationale, (c) tradeoffs, (d) owner, (e) review trigger/date.

## Handling tension safely (lightweight)

If you detect trust debt or conflict:
- Keep group activities bounded: focus on observable behaviors and working agreements.
- Avoid forced vulnerability exercises.
- If conflict is severe or involves HR/legal risk, escalate to human leadership/HR and redesign the offsite around safer topics.

## “Burst” cadence guidance (remote-first)

When to choose bursts:
- You’re mostly remote and need periodic high-velocity creative work and relationship reinforcement.
- You want a repeatable pattern (e.g., quarterly) with predictable budgets and ops.

Burst design defaults:
- Frequency: quarterly (or semi-annual for smaller teams)
- Length: 2 days (travel permitting)
- Day 1: connection + context + divergence
- Day 2: convergence + decisions + action plan + comms

## Output expectations (anti-“Monday amnesia”)

Within 24–48 hours:
- Send the decision/action summary
- Publish the memory artifact
- Schedule the first checkpoint (2–3 weeks)
