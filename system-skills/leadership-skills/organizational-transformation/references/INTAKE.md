# Intake Questions — Organizational Transformation

Ask up to 5 at a time. If unknown, proceed with assumptions and label them.

## A) Context + constraints
1) What’s the company stage/size, domain, and where are teams located (time zones/geos)?
2) What constraints matter most (regulatory, security, budget/headcount, immovable launches)?
3) Who is the executive sponsor and who has decision rights to change operating mechanisms?

## B) Why now + success definition
4) Why transform now (what broke / what changed)? What happens if nothing changes?
5) What would success look like in 90 days and 12 months (top 3 outcomes + leading indicators)?

## C) Current operating model (today)
6) How does work flow from idea → shipped today (who decides, who prioritizes, what meetings/rituals exist)?
7) Are teams primarily **feature teams** (project-based) or **product teams** (outcome ownership)? Examples?
8) What’s the current state of discovery (research, experiments, validation) vs delivery?

## D) System diagnosis inputs
9) What are the biggest bottlenecks (dependencies, approvals, rework, unclear ownership, incentive misalignment)?
10) What have you already tried (frameworks, reorgs, process changes)? What backlash/rejection happened?

## E) Change capacity + risk
11) How much change can the org absorb (low/medium/high)? Any change fatigue?
12) What risks are unacceptable (customer impact, uptime, compliance, morale, attrition)?
13) Which teams/areas are best candidates for pilots (high leverage + willing leadership)?
