# Workflow (Expanded) — Organizational Transformation

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance, heuristics, and common failure modes.

## Step 1 — Align on outcomes (not frameworks)

Heuristics:
- Treat frameworks as a **toolbox**, not a destination.
- Write 2–3 **anti-goals** (things you explicitly will not change yet) to reduce fear and scope creep.

Common failure modes:
- Transformation framed as process compliance (“use Jira this way”, “follow SAFe rituals”) rather than outcomes.
- “Everything changes at once” → backlash and systemic rejection.

## Step 2 — Diagnose the operating model as a system

Heuristics:
- Map reality (how decisions actually happen), not the org chart.
- Look for reinforcing loops that keep feature teams in place (e.g., annual planning + output metrics + centralized approvals).

Common failure modes:
- Vague diagnosis (“culture problem”) with no concrete mechanisms to change.
- Missing incentives: leaders say “outcomes” but reward output.

## Step 3 — Transformation thesis + guardrails (framework hygiene)

Heuristics:
- Pick the smallest set of changes that creates leverage (often: decision rights + team boundaries + discovery expectations).
- Define “borrow list” vs “do not borrow” from popular frameworks to reduce cargo-culting.

Common failure modes:
- Copying a model designed for a different product/architecture/talent maturity.
- Announcing “empowered teams” without changing decision rights and incentives.

## Step 4 — Design the target product operating model

Heuristics:
- Make it observable: specify required artifacts (problem briefs, discovery notes, decision logs).
- Define “Day 1 operating model”: meetings, owners, escalation paths, and where truth lives.

Common failure modes:
- Ambiguous decision rights (“everyone collaborates”) → hidden approvers and slow decisions.
- Roles without capability building (new expectations without training/coaching).

## Step 5 — Nudge-first pilots (90 days)

Heuristics:
- Prefer pilots that produce proof quickly (2–6 weeks) and are reversible.
- Use nudges: templates, rituals, coaching, and “default paths” rather than mandates.

Common failure modes:
- Pilot chosen for politics rather than leverage (low impact or doomed area).
- No learning loop: pilots run, but insights don’t change the plan.

## Step 6 — Roadmap (6–12 months)

Heuristics:
- Sequence: capability building + decision rights often need to precede structural changes.
- Reserve capacity for transformation work; don’t assume teams can do it “on top” of everything else.

Common failure modes:
- Big-bang reorg; in-flight work stalls; trust drops.
- No resourcing plan (transformation becomes “extra work”).

## Step 7 — Change + comms

Heuristics:
- Communication is an operating mechanism: repeat, show examples, reinforce with rituals.
- Plan for resistance: objections often contain real risks; harvest them into mitigations.

Common failure modes:
- One announcement, then silence → rumor and resistance.
- Leaders don’t model the new behaviors (teams follow incentives, not slides).

## Step 8 — Quality gate + finalize

Heuristics:
- Use the rubric to force specificity; revise by tightening decision rights, sequencing, and measurable pilots.
- Keep the plan safe: add rollback triggers and human checkpoints for high-risk moves.
