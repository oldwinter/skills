# Intake (Question Bank)

Use these questions to gather the minimum context to produce a Stakeholder Alignment Pack. Ask **3–5 at a time**.

## A) Alignment target (required)
1) What does “alignment” mean here: **inform, align, or decide**?
2) What is the decision/commitment we need (one sentence)? By when?
3) What happens if we do nothing (or fail to align) in the next 4–8 weeks?

## B) Stakeholders + decision rights (required)
4) Who is the **Decider** (or decision body)? Who can veto?
5) Who are the top 3–7 stakeholders to influence (roles/names), and what functions do they represent (Eng, Design, Sales, Support, Legal/Compliance, Finance, Security, etc.)?
6) Who will have to do real work after the decision (implementers)? Are they represented?

## C) User value + context (required)
7) Which user/customer segment is impacted, and what’s the intended user value?
8) What is the “vital question” we should anchor on? (e.g., “How does this make our users love us more?”)

## D) Constraints + tradeoffs (required)
9) What are the non-negotiables (deadline, budget, commitments, policies)?
10) Any compliance, security, privacy, legal, or monetization constraints to respect?
11) What tradeoff are we making (speed vs quality, growth vs risk, scope vs timeline)?

## E) Current alignment state (recommended)
12) What has already been discussed, and where does alignment break down?
13) What objections have you already heard (verbatim if possible)?
14) Which stakeholders must not be surprised in the live meeting?

## F) Artifacts + cadence (optional)
15) Should the primary artifact be a **memo/pre-read** or a **deck** (or both)?
16) What is the expected cadence: async pre-read, 1:1 pre-briefs, then decision meeting?
17) Any sensitive details we must avoid naming in writing?

## Default assumptions (use only if needed)
If the user can’t answer, proceed with these defaults and label them as assumptions:
- Outcome: align on a path and secure a next step (decision or timeboxed experiment)
- Decider: a single person or clearly named decision body
- Timeline: 3–7 days of pre-briefs + 1 decision meeting
- Artifact: 1-page Alignment Brief + stakeholder map + meeting plan + follow-up comms
