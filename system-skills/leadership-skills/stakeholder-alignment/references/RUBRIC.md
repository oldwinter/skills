# Rubric (Score 1–5)

Score each category from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Use the score to decide whether the pack is ready to run with stakeholders.

## 1) Alignment target clarity
1: “Alignment” is vague; no clear decision/commitment or timeline.  
3: Decision exists but scope/timeline is fuzzy.  
5: Decision/commitment, owner(s), and timeline are explicit and stable.

## 2) Stakeholder coverage + decision rights
1: Missing key functions; decision rights unclear; hidden veto likely.  
3: Most stakeholders covered, but influence/roles are still ambiguous.  
5: Decider/approvers/influencers/implementers are clear; no-surprises list is accurate.

## 3) “How they think” accuracy
1: Stakeholders treated as a monolith; incentives ignored.  
3: Some tailoring exists, but principles/evidence preferences are weak.  
5: Clear decision principles per key stakeholder; objections predicted and addressed.

## 4) User value + constraint framing
1: Proposal is “nice to have”; constraints/tradeoffs missing.  
3: Some framing exists, but vital question and constraints aren’t crisp.  
5: Simple, compelling user-value anchor plus explicit business constraints and tradeoffs.

## 5) Criteria quality (decision-ready)
1: Criteria missing or too many; no real tradeoffs.  
3: Criteria exist but don’t map to stakeholder principles.  
5: 3–7 meaningful criteria that map to stakeholder principles and force tradeoffs.

## 6) Pre-brief effectiveness (no surprises)
1: No pre-briefs planned; high risk of live-meeting blowup.  
3: Some pre-briefs planned but not targeted to decider/blockers.  
5: Targeted pre-brief loop completed; objections captured; change log maintained.

## 7) Commitment capture + follow-through
1: Meeting ends with “general agreement”; no owners/dates.  
3: Some owners exist, but comms and review plan are weak.  
5: Decisions, owners, dates, and review checkpoint captured and communicated.

## Interpreting scores
- **30–35:** Strong. Proceed with stakeholders.
- **26–29:** Medium risk. Fix the lowest 2 categories before the live meeting.
- **< 26:** High risk. Rebuild the alignment target, stakeholder map, and criteria.
