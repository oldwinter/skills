# Workflow (Expanded) — Cross-functional Collaboration

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance, heuristics, and failure modes.

## Step 1 — Define the mission (and collaboration mode)
Aim: convert “we’re misaligned” into a crisp mission with measurable success and clear stakes.

Heuristics:
- If you can’t name the outcome and the time horizon, you’re coordinating vibes, not work.
- Name the “mode” explicitly: **project team** (finite) vs **interface** (ongoing) requires different cadences and artifacts.

Common failure modes:
- A mission that’s really a task list (no outcome).
- Competing success metrics across functions (e.g., “quality” vs “speed”) that stay implicit.

## Step 2 — Map the system (stakeholders + incentives)
Aim: prevent surprise constraints and hidden approvers.

Heuristics:
- List stakeholders by **execution dependency**, not org chart.
- Capture incentives as “what they are optimizing for” and “what they fear.”
- In content/regulated domains, include subject matter experts directly in the mission (not as last-minute reviewers).

Common failure modes:
- “We forgot Legal/Support/Operations” (rework late).
- A stakeholder appears late with veto power.

## Step 3 — Make expectations explicit (write the contract)
Aim: replace assumptions with an explicit agreement.

Heuristics:
- Do the “expectations of each other” exercise: PM writes expectations of Eng/Design/Data; Eng writes expectations of PM/Design; etc.
- Turn disagreements into decision rights and escalation triggers (“who decides when we disagree?”).
- Revisit the contract every 4–8 weeks (or at phase changes).

Common failure modes:
- RACI theater: roles exist on paper but decision rights are still ambiguous.
- “Ownership” is assigned without authority or time.

## Step 4 — Establish shared language via artifacts (prototype-first)
Aim: reduce interpretive fights.

Heuristics:
- Prefer artifacts that move ambiguity to the surface: a working slice, prototype, or concrete example beats abstract debate.
- Define “artifact of record”: where the latest truth lives (charter, spec, metrics definitions).

Common failure modes:
- Multiple sources of truth that drift (doc sprawl).
- Requirements are negotiated verbally and never captured.

## Step 5 — Design the operating cadence + decision logging
Aim: reduce status theater while increasing decision velocity.

Heuristics:
- Default updates should be: **progress vs outcome**, **decisions**, **risks**, **asks**.
- Every important decision gets an owner, due date, and recorded rationale.
- Keep meetings small; expand visibility via async notes.

Common failure modes:
- Meeting sprawl replaces clarity.
- Decisions are re-litigated because they were never logged.

## Step 6 — Set norms for conflict and credit
Aim: build trust mechanics that prevent chronic resentment.

Heuristics:
- Use “Yes, and” to validate competing goals before proposing tradeoffs.
- If conflict repeats, it’s usually a missing decision right, unclear metric, or misaligned incentive—not a personality issue.
- Credit sharing is a system: define who presents, who gets named, and how recognition is shared.

Common failure modes:
- Credit hoarding (partners disengage).
- Conflict is avoided until it explodes (or becomes passive-aggressive).

## Step 7 — Quality gate + launch + monitoring
Aim: ship a usable pack and adjust based on reality.

Heuristics:
- Use the rubric as a “go/no-go”: if the score is low, do one more intake round.
- Run a 2-week health check: what decisions are stuck, what rework happened, what norms were ignored.

Common failure modes:
- The pack is created but never adopted (no kickoff / no owner).
- The cadence exists but doesn’t change outcomes (still thrash).
