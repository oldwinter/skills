# Templates — Cross-functional Collaboration

Use these templates to produce a Cross-Functional Collaboration Pack. Copy/paste and fill.

## 1) Mission Charter (template)

**Initiative:**  
**Why now (context):**  
**Timeframe:** (start → target end / checkpoint dates)  
**Collaboration mode:** project team / ongoing interface  

**Mission (1–2 sentences):**  

**Success metrics (top 1–3):**
-  

**In-scope:**
-  

**Out-of-scope:**
-  

**Non-negotiables (guardrails):**
- Timeline/deadlines:  
- Quality bar:  
- Policy/compliance/security:  
- Customer commitments:  
- Budget/headcount:  

**Key milestones (high level):**
-  

**Risks (early):**
-  

## 2) Stakeholder & Incentives Map (template)

Capture the cross-functional system so constraints and incentives are explicit.

| Stakeholder | Function | Role (DRI/Approver/Contributor/Informed) | Optimizes for | Concerns/risks | What they need | Comms (channel + frequency) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Missing seats (likely needed):**
-  

## 3) Roles & Expectations Contract (template)

**Primary driver/DRI:**  
**Decision model:** (RAPID/DACI/RACI-lite; pick one and keep it simple)  

### A) Expectations matrix (write “of others”, not just “of self”)

**PM expects Eng to:**
-  

**Eng expects PM to:**
-  

**Design expects PM/Eng to:**
-  

**Data/Analytics expects PM/Eng/Design to:**
-  

**Other functions (Marketing/Ops/Support/etc.) expectations:**
-  

### B) Responsibility map (who owns what)
- **Product:**  
- **Engineering:**  
- **Design:**  
- **Data/Analytics:**  
- **Other:**  

### C) Decision rights + escalation triggers

**Decisions this group can make:**
-  

**Decisions that require escalation/approval:**
-  

**Escalation triggers (specific thresholds):**
-  

### D) Review cadence (how the contract stays alive)
- Revisit cadence: (every 4–8 weeks / phase change)
- Artifact used for review: (decision log + retro notes)

## 4) Operating Cadence & Communication Plan (template)

**Doc hub / source of truth:** (link/path)  
**Primary channels:** (Slack/Teams, email, doc comments, tickets)  

### Meetings (keep minimal)
- **Weekly cross-functional sync** (attendees, agenda, decision focus)
- **Working session(s)** (optional; only when needed for fast iteration)
- **Stakeholder update** (optional; async-first)

### Default async update format (copy/paste)
- Progress vs outcome:  
- Decisions made / needed:  
- Risks + mitigations:  
- Asks / blockers:  
- Next milestone + ETA:  

### Decision logging protocol
- Every meaningful decision gets a log entry (owner, due date, rationale).
- Re-litigate only with new info or changed constraints.

## 5) Decision Log (template)

| Decision | Owner | Due date | Options | Criteria | Decision | Rationale | Follow-ups |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## 6) Conflict Protocol (template)

Use this when cross-functional partners disagree and progress stalls.

**Step 1 — Name the conflict (neutral language):**  
“We seem to be optimizing for X vs Y.”

**Step 2 — Validate both goals (Yes, and):**  
“Yes, speed matters because <reason>, and quality matters because <reason>.”

**Step 3 — Make constraints explicit:**  
- Non-negotiables:  
- What can flex:  

**Step 4 — Propose options + tradeoffs:**  
- Option A (tradeoffs):  
- Option B (tradeoffs):  

**Step 5 — Decide (or escalate via trigger):**  
- Who decides:  
- If escalating, what’s the question + recommendation:

## 7) Credit & Recognition Plan (template)

Make credit sharing explicit so partners feel ownership and pride.

**Where we will share credit (moments):**
- Demos/reviews:
- Exec/stakeholder updates:
- Customer-facing moments:

**How we will share credit (mechanics):**
- Rotate presenters (Eng/Design/Data get airtime).
- Name contributors explicitly in written updates.
- Celebrate “behind-the-scenes” work (quality, reliability, craft).

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- One function “owns the narrative” and others feel invisible.
- Recognition only goes to whoever speaks to leadership.
