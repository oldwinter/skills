# Checklists — Cross-functional Collaboration

Use these checklists before finalizing the Collaboration Pack and during execution.

## A) Collaboration Pack quality checklist (pre-flight)
- Mission is explicit (1–2 sentences) and tied to measurable success metrics.
- Timeframe and collaboration mode are named (project vs ongoing interface).
- Stakeholder map includes all execution dependencies and approvers (“no surprise veto”).
- Incentives/concerns are captured (what each function optimizes for + fears).
- Roles & expectations contract includes decision rights and escalation triggers.
- Artifact plan defines a source of truth and avoids doc sprawl.
- Operating cadence is sustainable and outcome/decision/risk oriented.
- Decision log exists and is seeded with the next 3–5 decisions.
- Conflict protocol is explicit and usable in a real disagreement.
- Credit/recognition plan prevents credit hoarding and creates shared ownership.
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps are included.

## B) Decision clarity checklist
- Every major decision has: owner, due date, criteria, and recorded rationale.
- The team agrees on “what would change the decision” (new info thresholds).
- Disagreements map to decision rights (decide vs escalate).

## C) Mid-flight health check (weekly/biweekly)
- The top 1–3 risks are named with mitigations and owners.
- Rework is trending down (fewer loops on the same issue).
- Decisions are made at the right level (not over-escalated).
- Meeting time is stable or decreasing while progress continues.
- Cross-functional partners feel seen (credit norms are actually practiced).

## D) Phase-change / retro checklist
- Update the roles/expectations contract based on what broke in reality.
- Capture at least 1 process improvement and 1 artifact improvement.
- Explicitly recognize cross-functional contributions (credit loop closed).
