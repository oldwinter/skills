# Source Summary (Usability Testing)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/usability-testing/SKILL.md`  
Category/persona target: **Product Management**

## What was in the source
The source skill provided tactical usability testing insights framed as quotes and takeaways from product leaders, including:
- Prefer **faked implementations** (fake door, Wizard of Oz) to validate core value before writing production code.
- Usability testing can produce **massive business value** via micro-level improvements (e.g., CTA/microcopy).
- Testing with busy stakeholders requires **flexibility and buffers** for scheduling.
- PMs can use modern tools to build functional prototypes to **bypass bottlenecks** and validate ideas early.
- Build product intuition by **observing people in the wild** using real products and environments.

Note: The source referenced “guest insights” for a deeper dive, but only `SKILL.md` was available in the raw source folder.

## How it was converted into an execution contract
Each insight was translated into rules, checks, and artifacts:
- “Fake it before you build” → require a stimulus/prototype strategy and a Wizard-of-Oz/fake-door option in the test plan.
- “Micro improvements matter” → require an issue log that captures severity/frequency and ties issues to funnel/metric impact.
- “Be flexible” → require recruiting/scheduling buffers and backups in the participant plan.
- “Prototype faster” → encourage a cheapest-valid prototype and clear disclosure of what’s simulated.
- “Observe in the wild” → include an optional “reality check” observation template.
