# Rubric (Usability Testing)

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = poor, 3 = acceptable, 5 = excellent). Include notes and a short improvement plan for any score ≤ 3.

## 1) Decision clarity
- **1:** No decision; “test for feedback.”
- **3:** Decision exists but is broad; success bar is fuzzy.
- **5:** Clear decision + deadline + explicit “what we’ll do if…” scenarios.

## 2) Stimulus/prototype strategy
- **1:** Stimulus is unclear or mismatched to the question.
- **3:** Reasonable choice, but limitations aren’t documented.
- **5:** Cheapest valid stimulus chosen; what’s simulated vs real is explicit (if faked).

## 3) Task design quality
- **1:** Tasks are leading, unrealistic, or refer to UI labels.
- **3:** Mostly realistic; a few tasks still bias outcomes.
- **5:** Neutral, scenario-based tasks with starting states and success criteria; includes micro-friction probes.

## 4) Participant fit + coverage
- **1:** Participants are “anyone”; poor fit for the scenario.
- **3:** Participant profile mostly fits; some gaps acknowledged.
- **5:** Clear inclusion/exclusion criteria with deliberate coverage (core + edge cases) and realistic recruiting plan.

## 5) Operations readiness
- **1:** Logistics/recording/roles are missing; session likely to fail.
- **3:** Basics covered; some operational risks remain.
- **5:** Moderator guide, tooling, backups, and note-taking roles are clear and test-ready.

## 6) Evidence capture quality
- **1:** Findings are opinionated; little evidence recorded.
- **3:** Evidence exists but is inconsistent or hard to trace.
- **5:** Notes include verbatims + timestamps/screens; issues are backed by concrete examples.

## 7) Synthesis + actionability
- **1:** A list of observations with no prioritization or fixes.
- **3:** Issues are prioritized; recommendations exist but lack expected impact.
- **5:** Prioritized issues with severity/frequency + directional impact; clear quick wins and follow-up plan.

## 8) Ethics + privacy
- **1:** Privacy/consent ignored; risky data handling.
- **3:** Basic consent/minimization; unknowns noted.
- **5:** Minimization + consent + storage/retention considerations are explicit; high-risk cases are gated on approval.

## Suggested overall rating
- **Excellent:** avg ≥ 4.2, no dimension < 4
- **Good:** avg 3.5–4.1, no dimension < 3
- **Needs work:** avg < 3.5 or any dimension < 3
