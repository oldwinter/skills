# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → Skill Pack)

Source file: `sources/refound/raw/designing-growth-loops/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill emphasized (visible excerpts)
- In fast-moving categories, growth often requires **innovating new loops** (not just optimizing existing ones). (Elena Verna)
- Viral growth can be treated as a **repeatable system** with platform-specific mechanisms (“growth hacks”). (Nikita Bier)
- **Paid acquisition loops** require healthy unit economics, especially sufficiently high **LTV**. (Yuriy Timen)
- Choosing acquisition channels benefits from a three-way fit: **customer needs × business goals × medium strengths**. (Adam Grenier)
- Mapping **micro and macro loops** into a qualitative model creates shared understanding and guides investment; augment with quantitative data. (Ben Williams)

## How this skill pack operationalizes those insights
- Converts insights into an executable **Growth Loop Design Pack** with explicit deliverables.
- Adds a 7-step workflow that produces:
  - a micro/macro loop map (shared qualitative model),
  - a loop scorecard (prioritization),
  - explicit gates for paid viability (unit economics),
  - a channel-fit triad check,
  - a measurement + instrumentation plan,
  - and an experiment backlog with 30/60/90 sequencing.
- Adds a quality gate (checklists + rubric) and requires **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.

## Notes / limitations
- The source references a deep dive file (`references/guest-insights.md`) that was not present in the repository snapshot; this pack is derived from the visible excerpts plus standard growth-loop practice.
