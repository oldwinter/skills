# Checklists (Quality Gate)

Use this checklist before finalizing a Growth Loop Design Pack.

## A) Scope + decision clarity
- [ ] The growth goal is explicit (metric + target + date).
- [ ] Target segment(s) are defined (not “everyone”).
- [ ] Constraints are stated (budget, capacity, brand risk, platform policies, legal/privacy).
- [ ] The decision this work informs is explicit (which loop(s) we invest in; whether paid is viable; innovate vs optimize split).

## B) Baseline is grounded
- [ ] Baseline includes at least one metric for acquisition, activation, and retention/engagement.
- [ ] Existing loops (if any) are documented with evidence.
- [ ] The core value moment is defined and consistent with the product’s value proposition.

## C) Loop model quality (qualitative)
- [ ] Micro loops are specified as input → action → output → feedback.
- [ ] A macro loop connects the micro loops (shared understanding of “how we grow”).
- [ ] Cycle time is estimated per loop (how long for one turn).
- [ ] Bottlenecks are named (what limits compounding today).

## D) Prioritization + gating
- [ ] Loop scorecard is present and picks top 1–2 loops (with rationale).
- [ ] Channel fit triad is applied (Customer × Business × Medium).
- [ ] Paid loop feasibility is gated by unit economics and measurement feasibility (if applicable).

## E) Measurement + learning plan
- [ ] Each selected loop has a KPI + leading indicators.
- [ ] Instrumentation requirements are specified (events/properties) or gaps are called out.
- [ ] Experiments have hypotheses, metrics, and timeboxes.

## F) Safety + ethics
- [ ] Mechanisms are policy-compliant and avoid manipulative/dark-pattern tactics.
- [ ] Risks include brand/trust and platform policy considerations.

## G) Required closing section
- [ ] The pack includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, and **Next steps**.
