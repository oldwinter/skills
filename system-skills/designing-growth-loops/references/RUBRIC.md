# Rubric (Score 1–5)

Score the Growth Loop Design Pack across dimensions. Use scores to decide whether to execute as-is or iterate.

## 1) Decision usefulness
1 = No decision; mostly brainstorming  
3 = Decision is named but implications are fuzzy  
5 = Clear decision + clear “what we’ll do differently” based on outcomes

## 2) Loop clarity (micro + macro)
1 = Tactics list; no feedback paths  
3 = Some loops defined but weak connections/bottlenecks  
5 = Clear micro loops + coherent macro loop; bottlenecks explicit; explainable in 60 seconds

## 3) Evidence grounding
1 = No baseline metrics; no assumptions labeled  
3 = Baseline exists but is incomplete or confidence unclear  
5 = Baseline + assumptions + confidence are explicit; claims tied to evidence or labeled hypotheses

## 4) Prioritization quality
1 = No scorecard; “pick everything”  
3 = Scorecard exists but selection rationale is thin  
5 = Scorecard drives a clear top 1–2 selection with trade-offs and rationale

## 5) Unit economics + paid gating (if applicable)
1 = Recommends paid without LTV/CAC/payback reasoning  
3 = Mentions unit economics but no clear gate  
5 = Paid loop viability is explicitly gated; prerequisites listed if not viable

## 6) Measurement + instrumentation readiness
1 = Metrics vague; no instrumentation plan  
3 = Metrics defined but data sources/gaps unclear  
5 = KPI + leading indicators; required events/properties; gaps + fixes are explicit

## 7) Actionability
1 = Vague recommendations (“go viral”)  
3 = Some experiments but weak sequencing/dependencies  
5 = Prioritized backlog + 30/60/90 plan; next 2 weeks unblocked

## 8) Safety + ethics
1 = Encourages manipulative tactics / ignores policy risk  
3 = Mentions safety but weak application  
5 = Explicit policy/ethics constraints; risks and mitigations are concrete

### Interpretation (suggested)
- **30–40:** Strong; execute and review cadence weekly.
- **22–29:** Good directional; tighten weak areas before big bets.
- **<22:** Rework inputs/baseline/loop definitions; too speculative.
