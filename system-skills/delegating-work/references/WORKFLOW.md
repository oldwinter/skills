# Workflow (Expanded) — Delegating Work

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance, heuristics, and failure modes.

## Step 1 — Frame the delegation decision
Aim: turn “please help” into a clear outcome + constraints.

Heuristics:
- If you can’t describe “done”, you’re delegating ambiguity (and setting up rework).
- Start with **context, not control**: why this matters, what tradeoffs exist, what must not change.

Common failure modes:
- Delegating a task list instead of an outcome.
- Delegating without stakeholder alignment (“surprise constraints” appear later).

## Step 2 — Pick the owner + autonomy level
Make delegation explicit. “You own it” means nothing without decision rights.

Autonomy level examples (pick one per workstream):
- **Recommend:** owner researches + recommends; you decide.
- **Decide with guardrails:** owner decides inside constraints; informs you.
- **Fully own:** owner decides and executes; you are informed at milestones.

Heuristics:
- Increase autonomy when the failure cost is low and learning value is high.
- Decrease autonomy when safety/compliance/reputation risks are high (but still avoid prescribing the path).

## Step 3 — Transfer context (not instructions)
Aim: ensure the owner can reason independently.

Include:
- Background + why now
- Prior decisions and “why we didn’t do X”
- Stakeholders and their incentives
- Known pitfalls / “gotchas”
- Example outputs (what “good” looks like)

Check: have the owner restate the problem and propose the first steps.

## Step 4 — Decision rights + guardrails
Aim: prevent thrash and surprise escalations.

Guardrails should cover:
- **Quality bar:** what must be true in the output
- **Non-negotiables:** policy/compliance/security, customer promises
- **Escalation triggers:** when to pull you in (thresholds)
- **Review points:** when you will look at artifacts (not daily task updates)

Examples of specific escalation triggers:
- “Any change that impacts pricing/packaging”
- “Any external customer communication”
- “Any security control change”
- “Any timeline slip > 1 week”

## Step 5 — Plan + milestones (owner-led)
Aim: keep the owner in the driver’s seat.

Your role:
- Ask questions that improve the plan (assumptions, risks, tradeoffs).
- Resist solving it for them; your job is to ensure the best answer is found.

Good milestones are outcome-linked:
- “Draft spec reviewed” not “met with team”
- “Experiment launched” not “built dashboard”

## Step 6 — Cadence + communication
Aim: create predictability without control.

Cadence design:
- Short, frequent check-ins early; reduce frequency as the owner stabilizes.
- Default agenda: outcomes, decisions, risks, asks.
- “Refuse to rule” unless an escalation trigger fires or the work drifts from the outcome/guardrails.

## Step 7 — Review in the details without micromanaging
Aim: be accountable for quality while preserving ownership.

Tactics:
- Review artifacts against criteria (acceptance, risks, customer impact).
- When giving feedback, state: **constraint → quality bar → impact** (avoid prescribing implementation).
- Separate “style preference” from “non-negotiable requirement.”

Signals you are micromanaging:
- You’re dictating the sequence of tasks.
- You’re rewriting work instead of giving criteria-based feedback.
- The owner stops bringing options and only asks for instructions.

## Step 8 — Debrief + durable ownership
Aim: make delegation compounding.

Debrief prompts:
- What assumptions were wrong?
- What guardrails were missing?
- What should we template for next time?
- What should the owner own going forward?

Deliverable: a short debrief note + an updated “who owns what” statement.
