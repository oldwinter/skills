# Rubric — Delegating Work (1–5)

Score the Delegation Pack before finalizing. Total score helps decide if you should ask for more input or proceed with assumptions.

## 1) Outcome clarity
1 = Vague (“make it better”); no definition of done  
3 = Outcome is stated; some criteria missing  
5 = Outcome + acceptance criteria are explicit and testable

## 2) Context transfer
1 = Only tasks assigned; little “why”  
3 = Some context; missing prior decisions/pitfalls  
5 = Strong context pack; owner can reason independently

## 3) Decision rights + guardrails
1 = No autonomy level; unclear authority  
3 = Some decision rights; vague escalation  
5 = Clear autonomy + specific escalation triggers + review points

## 4) Empowerment vs micromanagement
1 = Manager prescribes steps; owner reduced to executor  
3 = Mixed; some control patterns remain  
5 = Criteria-based leadership; manager stays in the details via artifacts

## 5) Operating cadence
1 = No cadence or overly frequent status checks  
3 = Cadence exists; updates not decision/risk oriented  
5 = Cadence is outcome/decision/risk oriented and sustainable

## 6) Closure + learning
1 = No debrief; ownership snaps back  
3 = Debrief exists; learnings not captured as changes  
5 = Debrief captured; durable ownership + process improvements

## Interpreting scores
- **26–30:** ship as-is
- **20–25:** ship with explicit assumptions + a short “unknowns” list
- **< 20:** do another intake round (max 5 questions) before finalizing
