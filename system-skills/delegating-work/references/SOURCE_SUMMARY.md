# Source Summary — Delegating Work (Refound/Lenny)

This skill pack was derived from the Refound/Lenny skill: `sources/refound/raw/delegating-work/SKILL.md`.

## What was preserved (key insights → operational rules)

### “Context, no control” (Ray Cao)
- **Rule:** Transfer the *why*, constraints, and success criteria; avoid prescribing the path.
- **In pack:** Delegation Brief + Context Handoff Pack + anti-micromanagement checklist.

### “Refuse to rule” (Boz)
- **Rule:** When the owner is struggling with the *right* problems, don’t rescue; support autonomy.
- **In pack:** Cadence rules of engagement + mid-flight checklist; escalation triggers to decide when to intervene.

### “Give away your Lego” (Cam Adams)
- **Rule:** Delegation is a role shift: find fulfillment in enabling others; make ownership durable.
- **In pack:** Close-out checklist + debrief prompts + explicit ownership updates.

### “In the details” ≠ micromanagement (Brian Chesky)
- **Rule:** Stay accountable for quality by reviewing artifacts against criteria, not by dictating steps.
- **In pack:** Review Plan template + rubric criteria-based review.

### “Ensure the best answer is found” (Carole Robin)
- **Rule:** Be a thought partner; ask questions; avoid being the default problem-solver.
- **In pack:** Owner-led planning step + coaching prompts embedded in workflow guidance.

## What was added (to make it agent-executable)
- A concrete **Delegation Pack** output contract (brief + guardrails + cadence + review + debrief).
- Templates, checklists, and a scoring rubric to make quality testable and repeatable.
