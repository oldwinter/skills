## 1) Delegation Brief (template)

**Work item:**  
**Owner:**  
**Why now (context):**  

**Outcome / Definition of done:**  
- Primary deliverable(s):  
- Acceptance criteria / success metrics:  

**Non-negotiables (guardrails):**
- Timeline / milestones:  
- Quality bar:  
- Budget / headcount:  
- Policy / compliance / security:  
- Customer impact constraints:  

**Scope**
- In-scope:  
- Out-of-scope:  

**Stakeholders**
- Approvers (must sign off):  
- Consulted (input):  
- Informed (visibility):  

**Known risks / landmines:**  
**Links / references:**  

## 2) Decision Rights + Guardrails (template)

**Autonomy level (pick one):** Recommend / Decide with guardrails / Fully own  

**Owner can decide:**
-  

**Escalation triggers (pull manager in):**
-  

**Required review points (artifacts + timing):**

-  

**Evidence / data sources:**
-  

## 4) Execution Cadence (template)

**Cadence:** (daily / 2x weekly / weekly)

- Decisions made / needed:  
- Risks + mitigations:
