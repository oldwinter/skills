# Examples (Content Marketing)

## Example 1 (B2B, SEO topic cluster)
**Prompt:**  
“Use `content-marketing`. Product: payroll automation for multi-state restaurants. ICP: finance ops managers at 20–200 locations. Goal: increase qualified demo requests from organic search by 20% in 10 weeks. Constraints: 1 marketer, 1 SME (tax), compliance review needed. Output: a Content Marketing Plan Pack with a demand-validated topic map, 6-week calendar, and 3 briefs.”

**Expected artifacts (abbreviated):**
- Topic map with demand evidence per SEO topic and a cluster plan (pillar + supporting posts)
- Calendar with owners/review dates/CTAs/distribution
- Briefs that include intent, angle, proof assets needed, and “information gain” commitments

## Example 2 (Founder-led, non-SEO thought leadership)
**Prompt:**  
“Use `content-marketing`. We’re a seed-stage devtool. Our founder wants to become known for strong opinions on ‘AI code review’. Choose a primary channel, set voice rules, produce a 6-week calendar, and create 3 briefs + one flagship outline.”

**Expected artifacts (abbreviated):**
- Primary channel choice justified (format fit + audience habits)
- Voice rules with “say this / not that”
- Briefs that include opinions/tradeoffs + examples/teardowns (information gain)

## Boundary example (wrong tool)
**Prompt:**  
“Fix our organic traffic—our site is slow, pages aren’t indexed, and Core Web Vitals are failing.”

**Expected response:**  
This is a technical SEO audit problem; recommend a technical SEO checklist/audit workflow. Offer to produce a content plan only after crawl/indexing issues are addressed.
