# Intake (Content Marketing)

Use this question bank to collect only what’s needed to produce a **Content Marketing Plan Pack**.

## How to ask
- Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**, then proceed.
- If the user can’t answer, propose reasonable assumptions and label them.
- Do not request credentials, private analytics access, or PII.

## A) Context + goals
1) What is the product, and who is it for (ICP/audience)?
2) What is the goal for content in the next 4–12 weeks (pipeline, awareness, signups, recruiting, retention, community)?
3) What is the primary success metric, and what are 2–3 leading indicators you can track?
4) What is the primary CTA/offer (demo, trial, download, newsletter, waitlist)?
5) What constraints do we have (timebox, team capacity, budget, compliance/legal review, regions/languages)?

## B) Audience + content market fit
6) Who is the buyer/user, and what are they anxious about professionally (promotion, risk, credibility, time, fear of looking incompetent)?
7) What are the top 5 questions they ask before they buy/adopt?
8) What misconceptions do they have about the category?
9) What objections stop them from acting?
10) What “point of view” do you want to be known for (1–2 sentences)?

## C) Spokesperson + voice
11) Who will be the “human face” of the content (founder/executive/PM/marketer/rotating SMEs)?
12) What formats are they naturally good at (long-form writing, short posts, video, audio)?
13) Any voice/tone guardrails (taboo words, claims, competitor mentions, compliance rules)?

## D) SEO + demand signals (no logins required)
14) Do you have any existing evidence of search demand? (Search Console exports, known high-intent queries, competitor pages that rank, support ticket themes)
15) What problems/features do prospects search for today (even if you don’t rank yet)?
16) What geographies and languages matter?
17) Any content you already have that should be refreshed or consolidated?

## E) Distribution + ops
18) Where will distribution happen reliably (email list, LinkedIn, communities, partners, webinars, sales enablement)?
19) Who owns distribution and repurposing, and how much effort is realistic per week?
20) What is your review workflow (SME review, legal, approvals) and typical turnaround time?
