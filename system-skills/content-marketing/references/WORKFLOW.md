# Workflow Notes (Content Marketing)

This file expands the SKILL workflow with decision rules and “default moves” that keep the output executable.

## 1) Default deliverable shape
Unless the user requests otherwise, produce a **Content Marketing Plan Pack** with:
- 4–8 week editorial calendar
- 3 content briefs
- 1 flagship outline/draft

If the user only wants a quick start, produce a 2-week calendar + 1 brief + 1 outline.

## 2) Content market fit: convert anxieties into repeatable promises
Common professional anxieties (pick 2–4 per ICP):
- “I’ll look incompetent / get blamed.”
- “I won’t hit my numbers / get promoted.”
- “I’m wasting time on the wrong thing.”
- “I’ll choose a tool and regret it.”

Turn anxieties into content promises:
- “Make the right decision faster.”
- “Avoid the mistakes everyone makes.”
- “Explain the hard thing clearly.”
- “Give me a template/playbook I can use today.”

## 3) SEO rule: no demand signal → no SEO piece
If you cannot show a demand signal, do one of:
- Reframe into a different query with evidence of demand.
- Convert it into thought leadership with a distribution plan (not SEO).
- Defer it and add a demand-validation task list.

Demand signals you can use without credentials:
- Google autocomplete + “People also ask” patterns (manual checks)
- Competitors ranking for the topic (SERP scan)
- Existing internal evidence (sales calls, support tickets, community questions)

## 4) “Information gain” rule (anti-generic content)
Every piece must include at least 2 of:
- A specific opinion (what you recommend + what you reject)
- A concrete example or teardown
- A reusable artifact (template, checklist, script)
- A unique framework/diagram
- Original data (even small: anonymized aggregates, survey snippets)

If you can’t produce information gain, don’t publish the piece.

## 5) Human voice rule (founder/executive content)
Default voice settings:
- First person (“I” / “we”) and direct language
- Admit tradeoffs and mistakes
- Avoid corporate filler (“best-in-class”, “cutting-edge”)

If ghostwriting is necessary, keep the founder involved via:
- 15-minute voice memo interview per piece
- SME notes + founder POV “stamp” section

## 6) Blog post as press-release alternative
When writing announcements:
- Include the “news elements” (what, who, when, why, details, CTA)
- Use a human tone (why you built it; what surprised you)
- Include assets for reporters (links, screenshots, quotes, boilerplate)

## 7) AI-assisted content SOP (safe defaults)
Use AI for:
- Outlines, structure, and rewriting for clarity
- Variant generation (headlines, intros)
- Consistency checks against voice rules

Do not use AI for:
- Inventing facts, customer quotes, performance claims, legal statements
- Auto-publishing without human review

Required human checks:
- Fact/claim check list
- “Information gain” check
- Compliance/brand review if required
