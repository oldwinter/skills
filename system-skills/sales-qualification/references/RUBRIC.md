# Sales Qualification — Scoring Rubric (1–5)

Score each category from **1 (weak)** to **5 (excellent)**. A “ship-ready” pack is typically **4+** across categories, with no critical 1–2s.

## 1) ICP clarity + segmentation
**1:** ICP is vague; no exclusions; unclear buyer/user.  
**3:** ICP is defined with partial segmentation and some exclusions.  
**5:** 1–3 clear segments with observable attributes, triggers, and explicit exclusions.

## 2) Disqualification strength (time protection)
**1:** No hard disqualifiers; reps can’t say “no” quickly.  
**3:** Some disqualifiers exist but are subjective or incomplete.  
**5:** Fast, objective disqualifiers + a graceful disqualify talk track; protects rep time.

## 3) Scorecard quality + consistency
**1:** Vague questions; no weights/anchors; outcomes inconsistent.  
**3:** Reasonable scorecard with partial anchors and thresholds.  
**5:** 5–8 criteria with weights and clear anchors; must-pass criteria; produces consistent accept/nurture/reject decisions.

## 4) Script effectiveness (diagnose → decide)
**1:** Script is pitchy, long, or doesn’t reach a decision.  
**3:** Mostly diagnostic; some gaps in urgency/process coverage.  
**5:** 20–30 min flow that reliably surfaces pain/impact/urgency/process and ends with a dated next step or close-out.

## 5) CRM usability + pipeline hygiene
**1:** No structured notes; stages rot; next steps unclear.  
**3:** Notes template exists; hygiene rules partial.  
**5:** Structured notes + stage exit criteria + “no next step, no stage” + stalled-deal policy; easy to audit.

## 6) Rollout + measurement plan
**1:** No adoption plan; no metrics.  
**3:** Some rollout steps and KPIs, but not operational.  
**5:** 2-week rollout with calibration + KPIs + iteration loop tied to funnel outcomes.

## 7) Completeness + actionability
**1:** Missing key artifacts; generic guidance.  
**3:** Most artifacts present; some ambiguity.  
**5:** Copy/paste ready pack with Risks/Open questions/Next steps; team can use it immediately.
