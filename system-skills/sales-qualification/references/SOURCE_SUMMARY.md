# Source Summary — sales-qualification (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/sales-qualification/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill covered
The source skill is extremely lightweight and centers on a single core idea: **most sales problems are actually qualification problems**—if you spend time on the wrong leads, the output is effectively zero.

## Top insights preserved and how they were transformed

1) **Qualification is the root cause of many sales problems (Jen Abel)**  
Original quote: “It’s qualification… if you spend your time on the wrong leads, that equates to a zero.”  
Preserved as:
- Step 2 (hard disqualifiers) and Step 4 (pipeline hygiene) in `../SKILL.md`
- Checklist **B** (disqualifiers) and **E** (pipeline hygiene) in [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md)
- Rubric categories **2** and **5** in [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md)

## Notes on additions (manufactured execution layers)
The source did not include an explicit framework, workflow, or artifacts. This skill pack adds:
- A clear input/output contract and an accept/nurture/reject decision model
- A 7-step workflow with checks
- Templates for a qualification charter, scorecard, call script, and CRM notes
- Quality gates (checklists + rubric) and required final sections (risks/questions/next steps)
