# Sales Qualification — Templates (copy/paste)

Use these templates to produce a **Sales Qualification Pack**. Keep language concrete and consistent across reps.

## 1) Context snapshot (1 page)

**Product (1 sentence):**  

**ICP (primary):** (industry, size, titles)  
**ICP (secondary):**  
**Exclusions (“not for”):**  

**Motion:** (inbound / outbound / PLG→sales / enterprise)  
**Who qualifies:** (SDR / AE / founder)  
**Handoff:** (SDR→AE rules, if any)  

**Deal profile:** (ACV range, cycle length, required stakeholders)  
**Primary funnel failure mode:** (where deals die/stall)  

**Qualification goal:** (e.g., fewer bad meetings, higher win rate, cleaner pipeline)  
**Constraints:** (SLA, tools/CRM, brand/compliance constraints)  

**Assumptions & unknowns:**  
-

## 2) Qualification charter (definition + rules)

### A) Definition of “qualified”
**We pursue when:** (1–2 sentences)  
**We nurture when:**  
**We disqualify when:**  

### B) ICP segments (1–3)
| Segment | Who | Use case | “Why now” triggers | Common objections | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

### C) Hard disqualifiers (fast “no” rules)
These are **non-negotiable**. If true, we **do not** advance.
- [ ] Not in ICP (segment mismatch)
- [ ] No meaningful pain/impact (cannot articulate a problem)
- [ ] No urgency/trigger (nothing changes in next 90–180 days)
- [ ] No access to buyer/process (no path to decision)
- [ ] Deal cannot clear value threshold (below price floor / ROI bar)
- [ ] Non-starter constraints (security/compliance/technical fit) **if applicable**

### D) Nurture triggers (when to re-open)
- Trigger events to watch for:  
- Follow-up cadence:  
- Content/asset to send:  

### E) Stage model (minimal)
Define 4–6 stages max.
| Stage | Entry criteria | Exit criteria (evidence) | Required next step | Max age | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lead |  |  |  |  |  |
| Qualified |  |  |  |  |  |
| Evaluation |  |  |  |  |  |
| Commit |  |  |  |  |  |
| Closed |  |  |  |  |  |

## 3) Qualification scorecard (weighted)

### Scoring instructions
- Score each criterion **0–3** (0 = absent, 3 = strong). Use anchors below.
- **Accept** if total ≥ **X** and all must-pass criteria are met.
- **Nurture** if total is mid-range or timing is uncertain.
- **Reject** if any hard disqualifier is true or total < **Y**.

### Scorecard table (example structure)
| Criterion | Weight | 0 (absent) | 1 (weak) | 2 (ok) | 3 (strong) | Score |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---:|
| ICP fit | 2 | Not ICP | Partial fit | Good fit | Perfect fit |  |
| Pain severity | 2 | No pain | Mild | Important | Hair-on-fire |  |
| Impact/ROI | 2 | Unclear | Small | Meaningful | Material |  |
| Urgency/trigger | 2 | None | Vague | 3–6 mo | <90 days |  |
| Access/process clarity | 2 | Unknown | Weak | Some clarity | Clear steps + owners |  |
| Champion strength | 1 | None | Curious | Advocating | Driving internally |  |
| Constraints/fit risks | 1 | Fatal | High | Manageable | Low |  |

### Must-pass criteria (choose 1–3)
- [ ] A compelling event in the next <X> days
- [ ] A buyer/user problem with measurable impact
- [ ] A path to decision (named stakeholders + steps)

## 4) Discovery/qualification call script (20–30 min)

### Agenda
1) Context + purpose (2 min)  
2) Current workflow + pain (8–10 min)  
3) Impact + urgency trigger (5–7 min)  
4) Decision process + stakeholders (5–7 min)  
5) Next step decision (3–4 min)

### Opener (sets expectations)
“Thanks for the time. I’m going to ask a few questions to see if this is a fit and whether it’s worth a next step. If it’s not, I’ll tell you quickly and we’ll end early. Sound okay?”

### Question bank (map to scorecard)
**Fit**
- Who is this for internally (roles, teams)?
- What are you using today (tools/process)?
- Any constraints we should know (security, IT, compliance, integrations)?

**Need + impact**
- What problem are you trying to solve right now?
- What happens when it breaks (time, dollars, risk, missed targets)?
- What have you tried already? Why didn’t it work?

**Urgency**
- Why now? What changed?
- Is there a deadline or event driving this?
- If you did nothing for 6 months, what happens?

**Access + decision process**
- Who else needs to be involved for a decision?
- What does the decision process look like (steps + timeline)?
- What would make this a “yes” vs a “no”?

### Next-step close (choose one)
- “Based on what you shared, I think this is a fit. Next step: <proposal> on <date> with <stakeholders>. Does that work?”
- “Timing seems early. Want me to send <asset> and we can revisit when <trigger> happens?”

### Graceful disqualify talk track
“From what you shared, I don’t think we’re the right fit because <reason>. If it helps, here are 1–2 alternatives I’d consider: <X/Y>. If <trigger> changes, I’m happy to revisit.”

**Problem (in their words):**  
**Impact (time/$/risk):**  
**Trigger / why now:**  
**Timeline:**  
**Stakeholders + decision process:**  
**Champion:** (who + strength)  
**Constraints/risks:**  
**Scorecard total + decision:** (accept / nurture / reject)

## 6) Rollout + measurement plan (2 weeks)

### Rollout plan
**Week 1**
- Train team on ICP + disqualifiers + scorecard anchors (30–60 min)
- Run 3 call reviews with live scoring + calibration
- Update scorecard anchors based on disagreements

**Week 2**
- Require CRM notes template for every qualified meeting
- Start weekly pipeline hygiene audit (10 opp sample)
- Publish “top disqualifier reasons” + improvements

### KPIs to track
- Lead→qualified rate (or meeting→opportunity conversion)
- Opportunity→win rate (or stage-to-stage conversion)
- % opportunities with a next step + median stage age
