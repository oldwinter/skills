# Source Summary (what was preserved and how)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/evaluating-trade-offs/SKILL.md`

## Preserved core insights → converted into rules/checks/artifacts

1) **All-in cost vs alternative uses of resources**
- Rule: evaluate options by total cost (people + engineering + tools + time), not just the obvious spend.
- Check: does the pack include an all-in cost table and explicitly compare opportunity cost?
- Artifact: **All-in cost + opportunity cost** table template.

2) **“Worse first” for meaningful change**
- Rule: if a decision has a short-term downside but long-term upside, name the dip and plan mitigations/leading indicators.
- Check: does the pack include a “worse-first” section when relevant?
- Artifact: **Worse-first + mitigation** template.

3) **Avoid false precision; use order-of-magnitude**
- Rule: use ranges and confidence; prefer 10× comparisons over tiny differences under uncertainty.
- Check: are estimates expressed as ranges with explicit assumptions (not fake decimals)?
- Artifact: **Impact ranges** table with confidence + key assumptions.

4) **Thought experiments before building**
- Rule: most experiments should start as thought experiments; only run a real experiment if it could change the decision.
- Check: does the pack include a pre-mortem and a minimal validation plan when uncertainty matters?
- Artifact: **Thought experiment + validation plan** step in workflow.

5) **Sunk cost is not a reason to continue**
- Rule: for continuation decisions, ask “Would we start today?” and set stop/continue triggers + review date.
- Check: are sunk costs explicitly ignored and triggers defined?
- Artifact: **Stop/continue triggers** template.
