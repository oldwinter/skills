# Checklists (quality gates)

## A) Decision framing checklist
- Decision statement is one sentence and includes a date/timebox
- Decision owner and stakeholders are explicit
- Options are concrete (2–4) and include “do nothing” when relevant
- Constraints/non-negotiables are stated up front

## B) Criteria + horizon checklist
- Criteria list is 4–8 items and includes at least 1 guardrail
- Time horizon is explicit and appropriate to the decision
- “Not optimizing for” is explicitly stated (prevents goalpost moving)
- Criteria reflect real trade-offs (not generic “everything”)

## C) Cost + opportunity cost checklist
- Costs include hidden items (maintenance/on-call, coordination, switching, tooling)
- Opportunity cost is explicit (what gets stopped/deferred)
- Costs are directionally comparable across options (same units/time horizon)

## D) Uncertainty + modeling checklist
- Impact is expressed as ranges with confidence (not fake decimals)
- Top 2–3 assumptions that drive the decision are stated
- The decision does not hinge on tiny differences that are within uncertainty bands
- A minimal validation plan exists if uncertainty is decision-critical

## E) “Worse first” + sunk cost checklist
- Expected short-term dip is named (if applicable) with mitigations + leading indicators
- Sunk-cost reset question is answered for continuation decisions
- Stop/continue triggers and a review date are defined

## F) Recommendation + comms checklist
- Recommendation names explicit trade-offs (what you will stop doing)
- Risks include mitigations, not just warnings
- Output includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**
- A stakeholder can decide async without re-litigating the debate
