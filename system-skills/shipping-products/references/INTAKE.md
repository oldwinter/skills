# Intake (Question Bank)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**, then proceed. If answers aren’t available, make explicit assumptions and list **Open questions** that could change the ship decision.

## A) Release context
1) What are we shipping (one sentence)? What’s explicitly **out of scope**?
2) Who is the primary user/customer segment? Any secondary audiences?
3) Where will it be available (platforms, regions, plans/tiers)?
4) What is the desired ship date/timebox? Any fixed constraints (events, contracts, deadlines)?
5) Who is the **DRI** and who decides **go/no-go**?

## B) Why now + success definition
6) Why ship this now? What happens if we don’t?
7) What are the top 1–3 success metrics? What are 2–5 guardrails (trust, reliability, latency, support load, cost)?
8) What is the expected impact and how confident are we (low/med/high)?

## C) Rollout and risk
9) What is the rollout approach (internal, beta, staged %, phased by segment, region rollout)?
10) Do we have feature flags / kill switch capability? If not, what’s the rollback strategy?
11) Any data migrations, backfills, or irreversible changes?
12) What’s the risk level (low/med/high) and why (security, privacy, money movement, permissions, availability)?

## D) Dependencies + readiness
13) Key dependencies (engineering, design, legal, data, sales, support, marketing, partners)?
14) What must be true before we can ship (compliance sign-off, docs, translations, pricing, analytics)?
15) What are the known unknowns and highest-risk assumptions?

## E) Quality + support plan
16) What quality bar is required (P0/P1 definitions, acceptable bug levels)?
17) How will we test (unit/integration/e2e, QA, beta users)? Who signs off?
18) Who is on point on launch day (on-call, escalation, comms owner)?
19) What is the support plan (macros, troubleshooting guide, known issues, SLAs)?

## F) Comms + enablement
20) Who needs to hear about this (internal teams, customers, partners)?
21) Is this an external launch? If yes, what channel(s) and what is the launch tier (minor/major)?
22) What customer-facing artifacts are required (release notes, help docs, API docs, migration guide)?
