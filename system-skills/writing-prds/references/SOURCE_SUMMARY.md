The source skill is “insight-heavy” and emphasizes that strong PRDs are a craft and a leverage point for cross-functional impact. The provided excerpt includes 5 guest insights (the original mentions more).

## Preserved insights → execution rules

### 1) PR/FAQ forces customer clarity (Bill Carr)
- **Rule:** Start with a customer-readable narrative before requirements when alignment is shaky.
- **Check:** A stakeholder can restate the customer benefit and urgency in one sentence.
- **Artifact:** Optional `PR/FAQ` (template in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md)).

### 2) For AI, evals can replace static requirements (Hamel Husain & Shreya Shankar)
- **Rule:** AI requirements must be testable via executable evals and acceptance criteria.
- **Check:** The eval suite can fail on regressions and pass when requirements are met.
- **Artifact:** `Eval Spec` + judge prompt + thresholds ([TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md)).

### 3) Artifact quality is “impact on impact” (Vikrama Dhiman)
- **Rule:** Treat PRDs and circulated artifacts as primary outputs; optimize for clarity and usability.
- **Check:** A cross-functional partner can execute without a meeting.
- **Artifact:** Checklist + rubric ([CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md), [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md)).

### 4) Prototypes and prompt sets are modern PRDs (Aparna Chennapragada)
- **Rule:** For AI features, include prompt sets (and prototypes when available) as part of requirements.
- **Check:** Prompts have versioning, examples, and guardrails; changes are reviewed.
- **Artifact:** `Prompt Set` template ([TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md)).

### 5) AI can accelerate drafting; narrative still matters (Claire Vo)
- **Rule:** Use AI to scaffold structure and user stories, but validate against real constraints and narrative coherence.
- **Check:** Assumptions are labeled; missing info triggers targeted questions.
- **Artifact:** Intake + workflow with missing-info strategy ([INTAKE.md](INTAKE.md), [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md)).
