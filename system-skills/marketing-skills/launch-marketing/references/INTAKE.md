# Intake (Question Bank)

Use this to collect the minimum information required to produce a Launch Marketing Pack.

## Minimal questions (ask these first; max 3–5 at a time)

1) What is launching (product/feature/company) and what changed? (1–3 sentences)
2) Who is the primary audience/ICP for this launch? (role, company type, and “why they care”)
3) What is the launch goal and success metric(s)? (pick 1–3)
4) What is the timeline (target date/window) and any hard constraints (legal/compliance/approvals)?
5) What proof assets do you have (demo, screenshots, customer quotes, metrics), and what’s TBD?

## Helpful follow-ups (pick only what’s needed)

### Launch context
- Launch type: company launch / product launch / feature launch / funding / partnership / rebrand
- Stage: pre-launch / beta / GA / expansion / reactivation
- Regions/languages/time zones to consider
- Competitive context: what alternative are you replacing?

### Audience + message
- Top 1–2 use cases you’re leading with
- “Why now?” (market shift, timing, urgency)
- What you do *not* want to say (taboo claims/words)
- Brand voice examples (2–3 samples or adjectives)

### Channels + constraints
- Channels available: PR, email, social, community, partners, paid, events, in-product
- Budget range and team capacity (who writes/designs/ships)
- Any PR constraints: embargo/exclusive preferences, existing relationships, sensitive info

### Proof + risk
- Evidence you can cite publicly (numbers, screenshots, customer quotes)
- What requires legal review (privacy, regulated claims, forward-looking statements)

## If inputs are missing

Proceed with explicit assumptions and label them clearly. Provide a short list of “evidence to collect” rather than inventing facts.
