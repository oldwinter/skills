# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance and heuristics.

## Step 2 — Core message (“steak”)

Aim for a message a non-expert can repeat:
- **Who it’s for**
- **What it helps them do**
- **Why it’s better than the alternative**
- **What to do next** (CTA)

Heuristic: if you need 5 sentences, it’s too complex for a launch headline.

## Step 3 — The “sizzle” hook (attention-earning moment)

The hook is the “reason to look” that earns attention fast. Common patterns:
- **Visual demo:** a 10–30s clip that shows a before/after
- **Surprising insight:** a stat or observation (must be verifiable)
- **Sharp contrast:** “Before: X. After: Y.” (concrete outcomes)
- **Artifact reveal:** template, tool, or resource people can use immediately

Guardrails:
- Avoid vague hype (“revolutionary”, “10x”, “game-changing”) unless you can prove it.
- Prefer “show” over “tell” (screenshots, GIFs, short clips, examples).

## Step 4 — Launch motion + sequencing (including PR exclusive)

### Choosing a launch motion
Pick based on goal + constraints:
- **Owned-first:** email list / blog / in-product. Best when you have an audience already.
- **Community-first:** Product Hunt, Reddit, Slack/Discord, niche communities. Best for developer/creator products.
- **PR-led:** useful when you have real news and a crisp angle, but requires careful execution.
- **Partner-led:** co-marketing with an ecosystem partner; works well for B2B platforms.

### Exclusive PR heuristic (early-stage)
An exclusive is often the simplest path when:
- you’re early-stage and want one credible story,
- you have a clean “news hook” (launch, funding, milestone),
- you can offer a reporter a clear angle + proof,
- you can accept that *one* outlet gets the first story.

Practical sequence:
1) Pitch **one** target outlet/reporter.
2) If no response by the deadline, move to the next.
3) After the exclusive runs, publish on owned channels.

Website readiness check:
- landing page loads fast
- signup flow works
- analytics/UTM tracking is ready
- support inbox + monitoring are staffed

## Step 5 — Channel plan (make it executable)

Your channel plan should be a table with:
- **Channel**
- **Audience segment**
- **Message angle**
- **Asset**
- **Date/time**
- **Success metric**

Heuristic: if a channel row has no CTA or no metric, it’s not real yet.

## Step 6 — PR outreach (make it copy/paste-ready)

Good pitches are:
- short (under ~150 words),
- specific about the news,
- clear on why the reporter should care,
- backed by 1–3 proof points,
- easy to respond to (“Can you take this as an exclusive?”).

Avoid:
- long narratives,
- lots of adjectives,
- confidential details.

## Step 7 — Internal readiness (“knowing what to do with it”)

Minimum internal enablement:
- 30-second talk track (what it is, who it’s for, why now)
- FAQs (top 10 questions)
- Objections and responses (top 5)
- Support escalation notes and known limitations

Heuristic: if sales/support needs to invent language, the launch will be inconsistent.

## Step 8 — Experiments (“throw things at the wall” without thrash)

High-volume experimentation is good when it’s structured:
- Define what “sticks” means (threshold metric + time window).
- Run small experiments across channels.
- **Double down** on the 1–2 winners; stop the rest.

Simple “double down” rule example:
- If a post format gets >3x baseline CTR (or shares) twice in a week, produce 5 more variants and allocate more distribution.

## Safety notes

- Drafting is safe; **sending** is irreversible. Always request approval before external outreach or public posting.
- For regulated or sensitive domains, include a “requires legal review” flag on any claim that could be risky.
