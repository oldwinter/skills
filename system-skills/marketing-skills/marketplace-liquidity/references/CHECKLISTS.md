# Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing the pack.

## A) Scope + contracts checklist
- [ ] Clearly states the decision this work informs (what you’ll do differently)
- [ ] Defines the core action (what counts as success) and the user perspective (usually buyer)
- [ ] Defines the local market unit (geo × category × time) and priority segments
- [ ] Lists constraints (budget, incentives, policy/trust, engineering capacity, timebox)

## B) Liquidity definition + metrics checklist
- [ ] Liquidity defined as **reliability** with explicit thresholds (fill rate, time-to-match, quality guardrails)
- [ ] Metric tree includes 1 north-star + 3–6 driver metrics + guardrails
- [ ] Each metric has a definition and is segmentable
- [ ] Flags data quality/instrumentation gaps

## C) Fragmentation + diagnosis checklist
- [ ] Segment scorecard exists (baseline numbers or clearly marked assumptions)
- [ ] Identifies fragmentation (thin markets, long tail, uneven geo/category distribution)
- [ ] Bottleneck diagnosis is labeled per segment (supply vs demand vs mechanics vs quality)
- [ ] Diagnosis includes at least one metric signal + one testable hypothesis
- [ ] Notes “flip-flop” risk (how interventions may change which side is constrained)
- [ ] Checks the graduation problem / supplier churn in key segments

## D) Interventions + experiments checklist
- [ ] 5–10 experiments are specified (hypothesis, segment, metric, timebox)
- [ ] Experiments include a reallocation/“whac-a-mole” plan (what gets moved weekly)
- [ ] Includes guardrails for trust/quality (cancellations, fraud, disputes)
- [ ] Experiments are sequenced (what you can do in the next 2 weeks)

## E) Measurement + operating cadence checklist
- [ ] Dashboards/alerts are specified (what, where, update frequency)
- [ ] Instrumentation plan ties metrics to events/tables
- [ ] Weekly liquidity review cadence exists with an agenda and decisions captured

## F) Finalization checklist
- [ ] Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**
- [ ] Risks include second-order effects (incentives, quality drop, fraud, supplier churn)
- [ ] Next steps are concrete and unblocked (data pull + 1–3 experiments + cadence)
