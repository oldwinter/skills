# Checklists (Content Marketing)

## A) Pack completeness checklist
- [ ] Context snapshot includes ICP, metric, timebox, CTA, constraints
- [ ] Content market fit brief lists anxieties + promises + objections
- [ ] Channel + voice strategy names a human spokesperson and one primary channel
- [ ] Topic map separates SEO vs thought leadership topics
- [ ] Every SEO topic has a demand signal (or is clearly marked “to validate”)
- [ ] Editorial calendar has owners, review dates, CTAs, and distribution channels
- [ ] At least 3 content briefs are included and are draft-ready
- [ ] AI-assisted content SOP includes allowed/disallowed uses + human checks
- [ ] Measurement plan includes cadence + decision rules
- [ ] Risks / Open questions / Next steps are included

## B) SEO demand validation checklist (per SEO piece)
- [ ] Target query is explicit and matches search intent
- [ ] Evidence of demand is documented (not just a guess)
- [ ] SERP angle states how this will be better/different (information gain)
- [ ] Internal linking plan exists (where this fits in the cluster)
- [ ] CTA matches funnel stage (don’t hard-sell on TOFU)

## C) Human voice checklist (founder/executive-led)
- [ ] First-person voice is used where appropriate
- [ ] Contains at least one specific opinion and one tradeoff

## D) AI-assisted writing checklist
- [ ] No invented facts, quotes, customer names, or performance claims
- [ ] “Information gain” present (2+: opinion/example/artifact/framework/data)
- [ ] Fact/claim checklist produced for review
- [ ] Final pass reads like a human wrote it (voice rules satisfied)
