## 2) Five-second moment + narrative arc (1–5)
- **1:** No clear turning point; story is generic.
- **3:** Turning point exists; arc is somewhat clear.
- **5:** Singular moment is vivid and the arc builds context → tension → moment → new belief cleanly.

## 3) Brand perception coherence (1–5)
- **1:** No stated perception target; story feels ungrounded.
- **3:** Perception target exists; some inconsistency remains.

## 4) Proof + credibility (1–5)
- **1:** Claims are unsupported; feels like hype.
- **3:** Some proof exists but doesn’t map to key claims.
- **5:** Proof bank supports key claims; unknowns are labeled and queued for validation.

## 5) Script usability across channels (1–5)
- **1:** Scripts are too long/short; not sayable.
- **3:** Scripts are usable; some edits needed.
- **5:** 2-min, 30-sec, and website versions are immediately usable and match channel constraints.
