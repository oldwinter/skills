# Source summary (what this skill preserves and how it was transformed)

## Source
Refound/Lenny skill: `sources/refound/raw/brand-storytelling/SKILL.md`

## What the original covered
- Brand story, founder story, origin story, narrative, storytelling (Marketing category)
- A small set of guest insights (5 shown in the source file) plus a reference to a deeper “guest-insights” file that was not present in the repo

## Key guest insights preserved (and how they map to this pack)
1) **Singular “five-second moment”** (Matthew Dicks)  
   - Transformed into: Step 3 + Checklist D + Templates “Story brief / beat map”
2) **Brand = external perception; strategy shapes it** (Arielle Jackson)  
   - Transformed into: Step 2 “brand perception target” (purpose/positioning/personality)
3) **Build in public via founder/employee socials** (Elena Verna)  
   - Transformed into: Step 7 + Templates “build-in-public plan” + guardrails
4) **Brand as identity-based loyalty (esp. consumer)** (Kevin Aluwi)  
   - Transformed into: Step 6 “identity hooks” (with ethical guardrails)
5) **Command the room with pithy storytelling** (Merci Grace)  
   - Transformed into: Step 8 “pithy answers + Q&A bank” and delivery readiness checks

## What was added to make it agent-executable
- Explicit input/output contracts (what the user must provide; what the agent must deliver)
- A step-by-step workflow with checks at each step
- Copy/paste templates, a quality checklist, and a scoring rubric
- Safety constraints: no fabricated facts; avoid confidential info; flag regulated claims
