# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance and heuristics.

## Step 1 — Intake + success definition
Define success as a *measurable change*:
- Fewer “so what is it?” questions
- Higher conversion from About → Signup
- Better pitch comprehension/recall
- More inbound from the right people

If no metric exists, define a proxy (e.g., “3/5 new listeners can retell the story in one sentence”).

## Step 2 — Brand perception target (purpose, positioning, personality)
Use this as the story’s “north star”:
- **Purpose:** why you exist (beyond revenue)
- **Positioning:** who it’s for, what you do, what alternative you replace, why you’re different
- **Personality:** how you sound and behave (voice + values in action)

Heuristic: if you can’t state the perception target in 3 bullets, it’s too vague to guide storytelling.

## Step 3 — The “five-second moment” (singular change)
The story should center on one brief moment of internal change:
- A realization (“I used to believe X, then I learned Y”)
- A transformation (“I used to do X, then something happened, now I do Y”)

Prompts to find it:
- “What did you see/hear that changed your mind?”
- “What was the uncomfortable truth you couldn’t ignore?”
- “What did you try that failed, and what did you learn?”

Heuristic: if the moment is “we decided to start a company”, it’s probably not specific enough.

## Step 4 — Narrative arc (context → tension → moment → new belief)
Aim for a tight arc:
1) **Context:** the world before (constraints, stakes)
2) **Tension:** why the status quo failed (specific pain)
3) **Moment:** the realization/transformation (the “five seconds”)
4) **New belief:** what you now believe to be true
5) **Action:** what you built / how you operate differently
6) **Proof:** why believe (evidence, customer moments)
7) **Invitation:** the CTA

Heuristic: every paragraph should serve one of the beats above.

## Step 5 — Channel scripts (make it usable)
Write multiple lengths:
- **2-minute script:** the full arc, sayable out loud
- **30-second script:** the core change + proof + invitation
- **Website paragraph:** skimmable, concrete nouns/verbs, no hype

Heuristic: if the 30-second version doesn’t work, the story is not clear enough.

## Step 6 — Proof + identity hooks (without manipulation)
Attach proof to claims:
- metrics, case snippets, quotes, demos, screenshots, credibility signals

For consumer stories, identity hooks can be honest and non-coercive:
- “This is for people who…”
- “If you believe X, you’ll love how we…”

Guardrail: avoid false promises (“this will change your life”) and avoid implying outcomes you can’t support.

## Step 7 — “Build in public” plan (stay human, stay safe)
“Build in public” works best when it’s:
- consistent (a cadence you can sustain)
- specific (show work, not vague inspiration)
- human (founder/team voice)

Guardrails:
- Don’t share confidential info, customer secrets, or security details
- Don’t over-claim; label uncertainty
- Prefer learning updates over performative hype

Lightweight daily shipping update format:
- **Shipped:** …
- **Why it matters:** …
- **What we learned:** …
- **What’s next:** …

## Step 8 — Pithy answers + Q&A (own the room)
For high-stakes contexts (pitch, press, podcast), prepare:
- **1-sentence pithy answers** (short, memorable, true)
- a **Q&A bank** with evidence

Pithy-answer pattern:
1) **Belief:** what we learned about the problem
2) **Action:** what we do differently
3) **Outcome:** what changes for the customer (with proof)

Finalize by running [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) and scoring [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md), then add Risks/Open questions/Next steps.
