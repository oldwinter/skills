# Source summary (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/vibe-coding/SKILL.md`

The source skill is insight-heavy: tactical advice on “vibe coding” from 3 product leaders. The key theme is a new, timeboxed mode of building where people (including non-engineers) use AI to create functional prototypes and even build tools that accelerate further creation.

## Preserved insights → execution rules

### 1) Build tools to build the thing (Alexander Embiricos)
- **Rule:** If a tiny editor/generator meaningfully reduces time-to-demo, build the tool and immediately use it to advance the prototype.
- **Check:** The helper tool pays for itself within the current timebox; otherwise it is cut.
- **Artifact:** Step 6 in `../SKILL.md` + helper-tool checklist in [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md).

### 2) Vibe coding is a distinct, valuable skill for non-technical roles (Elena Verna)
- **Rule:** Use a repeatable loop (brief → spec → prompts → slices → demo) so non-engineers can reliably ship prototypes, not just “prompt.”
- **Check:** The process produces a runnable prototype with a runbook and demo script, not only design mocks.
- **Artifact:** Output contract in `../SKILL.md` + templates in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md).

### 3) Show functional prototypes instead of static mocks (Kevin Weil)
- **Rule:** Default to a clickable, runnable prototype for concept communication; keep scope to one hero flow and mock the rest.
- **Check:** A stakeholder can run the demo in ≤ 5 minutes and complete the hero scenario.
- **Artifact:** Demo readiness checklist in [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) + runbook template in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md).
