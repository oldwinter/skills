# Intake questions (ask 3–5 at a time)

## 1) Demo promise + timebox
- What is the one thing the user should be able to do in the demo (hero scenario)?
- What is the timebox (30/60/90 minutes) and who is the demo audience?
- What level of fidelity is needed: “clickable”, “usable”, or “almost shippable” (prototype-only)?

## 2) User + workflow context
- Who is the target user and what situation are they in?
- Where does this fit: internal tool, customer-facing feature, or concept exploration?
- What are 3–5 explicit non-goals to prevent scope creep?

## 3) Platform + constraints
- Preferred platform: web app, mobile, desktop, CLI, spreadsheet, etc.?
- Any must-use tech stack or environment constraints?
- Any accessibility requirements for the demo?

## 4) Data + integrations (default to mock)
- Can we use mock data for the demo? If not, what’s the minimum real data needed?
- Any required integrations (APIs, files, databases)? What can be stubbed?
- Any privacy/compliance constraints (PII/PHI, retention, logging restrictions)?

## 5) “Build tools to build the thing” opportunities
- What parts are repetitive or painful (editing, transforming content, creating assets)?
- Would a tiny helper tool/editor meaningfully speed up the demo within the timebox?

## 6) Execution constraints (if writing code)
- Are we allowed to run commands and write files? Any repo constraints?
- Do we need a human review gate before edits/commands?
- What’s the rollback plan (git diff/revert, branch, backup folder)?
