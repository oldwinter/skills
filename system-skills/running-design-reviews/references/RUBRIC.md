# Rubric (Score 1–5 per category)

Use this to score the Design Review Pack. Target: **≥24/30**.

## 1) Decision clarity
1 = No decision; “get feedback” only  
3 = Decision exists but still fuzzy  
5 = Clear decision statement + explicit in/out scope

## 2) Preparation quality
1 = No pre-read; unclear context  
3 = Some context; artifacts exist but are hard to review  
5 = Brief is reviewable async; links/states/constraints are clear

## 3) Feedback quality (structure + hierarchy)
1 = Preference wars / minutiae-first  
3 = Some structure but inconsistent  
5 = Feedback captured as observation+impact and prioritized Value→Ease→Delight

## 4) Synthesis + prioritization
1 = Long list; no priorities  
3 = Priorities exist but not tied to impact/risk  
5 = Top issues + severities + rationale are clear; conflicts resolved via goals/constraints

## 5) Decisions + tradeoffs captured
1 = Decisions left implicit  
3 = Some decisions captured; tradeoffs missing  
5 = Decision record includes rationale + tradeoffs + owners/dates

## 6) Follow-through
1 = No owners/dates; no next review plan  
3 = Owners exist; weak next step clarity  
5 = Action plan is executable; follow-up message + next gate scheduled

## Interpretation
- **24–30:** High-quality review; proceed.
- **18–23:** Acceptable but needs tightening (usually decision clarity or prioritization).
- **≤17:** Re-run with better prep and clearer requested feedback.
