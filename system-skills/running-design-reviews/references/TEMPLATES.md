**Owner (presenter):**  
**Sponsor/DRI:**  
**Review type:** (concept / flow / content / polish / ship-readiness)  
**Decision needed:** (what will change after this review?)  
**Requested feedback (1–3 questions):**  
**Out of scope for this review:**  

### Context
**Target user + JTBD:**  
**Problem + why now:**  
**Success criteria (1–3):**  
**Constraints/guardrails:** (timeline, platform, a11y, tech, content, legal)  

### What we’re reviewing
**In scope:** (flows/screens/states)  
**Known unknowns:**  
**Options considered:** (if any)  

### Risks / tradeoffs to focus on
-  

### Artifacts / links
- Prototype / Figma:
- Screenshots (if needed):
- Related doc (PRD/spec):

### How to review (instructions)
- Start with big-picture: what feels off overall?
- Then prioritize feedback by **Value → Ease → Delight**.
- Log feedback using the table template below.

## 2) Agenda + facilitation script (45 min default)
**Roles:** Facilitator / Sponsor / Presenter / Note-taker  

1) **Priming (5 min)**
   - Goal + decision needed
   - Requested feedback questions
   - What is out of scope today
2) **Live demo (15 min)**
   - Presenter walkthrough (happy path + top edge case)
   - Sponsor interrupts only for “why” / concept clarity
3) **Feedback capture (15 min)**
   - Round 1: Value
   - Round 2: Ease
   - Round 3: Delight (only if time)
4) **Synthesis + decisions (10 min)**
   - Top 3 issues
   - Decisions made today vs open questions
   - Owners + due dates

Facilitation prompts:
- “What problem is this solving, in one sentence?”
- “Where does the flow break or feel confusing?”
- “What’s the riskiest assumption here?”
- “If we ship this, what might we regret?”
