# Rubric (Score 1–5)

Score the Written Communication Pack. Aim for **≥ 3** on every dimension before sending. If any dimension is **≤ 2**, revise.

## 1) Outcome + ask clarity
1 = unclear why the reader should care; ask is implied  
3 = ask is explicit with a clear deadline/response path  
5 = outcome is crisp; decision/action path is effortless for the reader

## 2) “How” specificity (actionability)
1 = mostly context; no concrete steps  
3 = next steps exist with owners and reasonable dates  
5 = highly actionable plan with dependencies, sequencing, and clear ownership

## 3) Structure + scanability (clarity at scale)
1 = hard to skim; walls of text; buried lede  
3 = TL;DR + headings + bullets; easy to follow  
5 = optimized for skim + deep read; information hierarchy is excellent

## 4) Correctness + completeness (given inputs)
1 = missing key facts; likely to confuse or mislead  
3 = includes necessary context, constraints, and links  
5 = accurate, complete, and anticipates key reader questions

## 5) Tone + trust
1 = defensive, blaming, or mismatched to audience  
3 = direct and respectful; appropriate confidence level  
5 = builds trust; acknowledges uncertainty; invites constructive response

## 6) Source of truth + follow-through
1 = no place to find “latest”; follow-ups inevitable  
3 = canonical doc/link and next update cadence exist when needed  
5 = reduces future meetings: decisions, owners, and cadence are crystal clear
