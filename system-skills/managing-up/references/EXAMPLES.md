# Examples

**Example 1 (new relationship):** “I started a new PM role. Help me manage up with my manager: create a manager profile template, a weekly update format, and a 4-week pilot cadence.”  
Expected: manager profile + cadence + weekly update template + pilot plan + risks/open questions/next steps.

**Example 2 (exec misalignment):** “Our exec team keeps changing priorities and feels out of touch. Create an exec-ready weekly update and a trade-off memo template so I can escalate issues early and frame decisions.”  
Expected: weekly update + decision/trade-off memo + escalation triggers + comms map.

**Boundary example:** “My manager is retaliating against me and I need to document it.”  
Response: recommend HR/legal/company process; offer to create a factual incident timeline template and a neutral summary, but do not provide legal advice.
