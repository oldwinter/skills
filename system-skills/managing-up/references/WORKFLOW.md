# Expanded Workflow: Managing Up

This file expands the workflow in `SKILL.md` with practical heuristics, scripts, and “rules + checks”.

## Principles to follow (rules + checks)

### 1) Treat managing up as a partnership, not a complaint
- **Rule:** Act like your manager is a teammate with unique leverage; proactively make it easy for them to help you.
- **Check:** You have a consistent update cadence and clear “asks” instead of surprise escalations.

### 2) Over-communicate context and trade-offs upward
- **Rule:** When you surface a problem, include the trade-offs, constraints, and what you recommend.
- **Check:** Leaders rarely respond with “why didn’t I know this sooner?” or “I don’t understand what’s at stake.”

### 3) Use leaders as resources (with specificity)
- **Rule:** Translate blockers into a concrete action your leader can take (decision, sponsor, unblock, introduce, prioritize).
- **Check:** Your asks are time-bounded, binary when possible, and easy to say yes/no to.

### 4) Escalate earlier than feels comfortable (but not noisily)
- **Rule:** Escalate when changing course is still possible; don’t wait until the outcome is already determined.
- **Check:** Escalations include “options + recommendation” and land before the deadline cliff.

### 5) Boundaries protect outcomes
- **Rule:** Push back on unreasonable demands by anchoring on outcomes (quality, sustainability, decision integrity) and proposing alternatives.
- **Check:** You have a written working agreement and fewer “random 10pm meeting” incidents.

### 6) Earn the seat before you’re invited
- **Rule:** Show business-level thinking via crisp POVs, pre-reads, and trade-off framing; be useful in the forums you can access.
- **Check:** You’re increasingly pulled into higher-level conversations and asked for input earlier.

## Step-by-step guidance (practical)

### Step 2: Manager profile prompts (validation questions)
Use these in a 1:1 to validate your draft profile without sounding weird:
- “When you think about our org’s success this quarter, what are the top 2–3 things you’re optimizing for?”
- “How do you prefer I bring you issues—options first, or raw info first?”
- “What kinds of decisions do you want pulled to you vs handled at my level?”
- “What does a ‘good weekly update’ look like for you: detail level, format, timing?”

### Step 3: “What goes where” map (example)
- **Async weekly update:** progress vs plan, risks, decisions needed, asks, trade-offs
- **1:1:** priorities, decision-making, coaching, alignment, relationship/feedback
- **Decision memo / pre-read:** high-stakes choices, trade-offs, alignment ahead of meetings
- **Urgent escalation path:** time-critical risks (clear trigger list + “what I need from you”)

### Step 4: Weekly update heuristics (make it skimmable)
Default guidance:
- Put the ask near the top (or clearly in its own section).
- Use “no reply required unless …” to reduce burden.
- Avoid long narratives; link to deeper docs if needed.
- Always include **trade-offs** when outcomes look worse than expected.

### Step 5: Ask ladder (from light to heavy)
1) **FYI:** “No response needed; keeping you in the loop.”
2) **Nudge:** “If you disagree, please tell me by <date>.”
3) **Unblock:** “Please remove blocker X by doing Y.”
4) **Sponsor:** “Please signal priority to <team/person> so we can proceed.”
5) **Decision:** “Choose A or B by <date>; my recommendation is A because…”

### Step 6: Boundary scripts (short patterns)
Use one of these, then propose an alternative.

Late-night meeting request:
- “I can’t do 10pm tonight. I can do 8am tomorrow or I can send a written update now—what’s better for you?”

Urgency inflation:
- “If this is urgent, we should drop something else. Which priority should we deprioritize to make room?”

Scope creep:
- “Adding this will push the date or reduce quality. Here are the options; which trade-off do you want?”

### Step 7: Pre-wiring (how to avoid surprises in exec forums)
Pre-wire before a leadership meeting:
- 1–2 sentence TL;DR
- the decision you want
- the two main trade-offs
- who you’ve already aligned with (and who you haven’t)

## Retro prompts (end of 4-week pilot)
- “Where did we still get surprised?”
- “Which updates were too noisy or too thin?”
- “Where did escalation happen too late?”
- “Did we get faster decisions? More autonomy? Better alignment?”
