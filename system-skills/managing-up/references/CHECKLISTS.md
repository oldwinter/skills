# Checklists (Quality Gates)

Use these checklists before finalizing the pack.

## A) Pack completeness (must pass)
- [ ] Includes a clear **goal** for managing up and a 4-week success definition
- [ ] Includes a **manager profile** with actionable implications (not generic traits)
- [ ] Includes a **comms cadence** and “what goes where” map (async / 1:1 / memo / escalation)
- [ ] Includes an **exec-ready weekly update** template (skimmable + “no response required” default)
- [ ] Includes a **decision/trade-off memo** template for major calls
- [ ] Includes an **escalation + ask plan** (triggers + ask ladder + leader actions)
- [ ] Includes a **working agreement + boundary script** (respectful, outcome-based)
- [ ] Includes an **influence plan** (30-day loop, pre-wiring, forums)
- [ ] Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**

## B) Upward communication quality
- [ ] Updates are skimmable (TL;DR + decisions + risks + asks)
- [ ] Trade-offs and constraints are explicit when outcomes are worse than hoped
- [ ] Leaders are not surprised by major risks or deadline cliffs

## C) Ask / escalation quality
- [ ] Each ask is actionable and time-bounded (binary when possible)
- [ ] Escalations happen while there is still room to change course
- [ ] The plan minimizes noise (clear triggers, not constant escalations)

## D) Boundary + relationship safety
- [ ] Boundaries are framed as protecting outcomes (quality/speed/sustainability)
- [ ] Scripts are respectful and propose alternatives (not just “no”)
- [ ] HR/legal boundaries are clear for sensitive situations

## E) Influence plan quality
- [ ] Includes at least one recurring “strategic contribution” touchpoint per week
- [ ] Pre-wiring is included (avoid surprises)
- [ ] Success signals are defined (invited earlier, faster decisions, clearer autonomy)
