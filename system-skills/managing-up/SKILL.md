# Managing Up

## Scope

**Covers**
- Building a proactive **partnership** with your manager (vs waiting to be managed)
- Setting a clear **upward communication system** (async updates, 1:1 structure, decision memos)
- **Leveraging leaders** to remove blockers and accelerate decisions (clear asks + escalation triggers)
- Communicating **trade-offs and context** so leadership can make good calls
- Creating a “seat at the table” path: showing **business-level perspective** before you’re invited
- Setting **boundaries** when leadership pace/expectations are misaligned (without being adversarial)

**When to use**
- “Help me manage up with my boss—set a cadence and a weekly update template.”
- “My exec stakeholders feel out of touch—help me communicate context and trade-offs better.”
- “I need a clean escalation plan and how to ask my leader for help without sounding needy.”
- “I want more influence / a seat at the table—create a plan and artifacts.”

**When NOT to use**
- You need HR/legal guidance (harassment, discrimination, retaliation, threats, investigations) — follow your company process and involve HR/legal.
- You’re negotiating compensation/title or a formal performance process — use your company process; this skill can help with communication artifacts but not with policy/legal strategy.
- You have a personal safety or mental-health crisis — seek professional help and follow company policy.

## Inputs

**Minimum required**
- Your role, scope, and current priorities (what you own; what “good” looks like in the next 4–8 weeks)
- Who you’re managing up to (manager level; decision power; relationship stage: new/stable/strained)
- Current friction (2–5 concrete examples) and desired outcome (clarity, autonomy, speed, influence, boundaries)
- Communication environment (remote/hybrid, time zones, tools, meeting cadence)
- Constraints (sensitive topics, confidentiality/PII rules, upcoming deadlines)

**Missing-info strategy**
- Ask up to 5 questions from [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md) (3–5 at a time).
- If details are missing, proceed with a **default managing-up operating system** and clearly label assumptions.
- Do not request secrets (passwords/tokens) or sensitive personal data; use anonymized summaries.

## Outputs (deliverables)

Produce a **Managing Up Operating System Pack** in Markdown (in-chat; or as files if requested):

1) **Context snapshot** (role, goals, constraints, assumptions)
2) **Manager profile** (“How my manager works” + what they optimize for)
3) **Upward communication cadence** (1:1 structure + async update rhythm)
4) **Weekly update template** (exec-ready; “no response required” default)
5) **Decision/trade-off memo template** (for major decisions / escalations)
6) **Escalation + ask plan** (leader leverage map, escalation triggers, ask ladder)
7) **Working agreement + boundary script** (how to reset expectations respectfully)
8) **Influence / seat-at-the-table plan** (pre-wiring, strategic contribution loop)
9) **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** (always included)

## Workflow (8 steps)

### 1) Intake + objective + boundaries
- **Inputs:** user context; [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md).
- **Actions:** Clarify the outcome (autonomy, clarity, influence, speed, boundaries) and define what “better” means in 4–8 weeks. Identify constraints (HR/legal/PII). Choose pack scope (full pack vs subset).
- **Outputs:** Context snapshot + assumptions/unknowns list.
- **Checks:** Goal is measurable enough to evaluate after 4 weeks.

### 2) Build a manager profile (what they optimize for)
- **Inputs:** org context, manager level, prior interactions.
- **Actions:** Draft “How my manager works”: success metrics, incentives/pressures, decision style, risk tolerance, communication preferences, and common failure modes.
- **Outputs:** Manager profile (draft) + validation questions to confirm in 1:1.
- **Checks:** Profile includes at least 3 actionable implications (what to do differently).

### 3) Design the comms operating system (what goes where)
- **Inputs:** current cadences, meeting load, tools.
- **Actions:** Define channels: async weekly update, 1:1 agenda, decision memos for big calls, and escalation path for urgent issues. Decide what does **not** belong in 1:1s (pure status, unless required).
- **Outputs:** Cadence plan + “what goes where” map.
- **Checks:** System reduces surprises and reduces “drive-by” requests.

### 4) Write the weekly update + exec-ready narrative
- **Inputs:** priorities, milestones, risks, dependencies.
- **Actions:** Create a weekly update that is skimmable: TL;DR, progress vs plan, decisions needed, risks, explicit trade-offs, and clear asks. Default to “no reply required unless…”.
- **Outputs:** Weekly update template + example filled-in update (anonymized).
- **Checks:** A leader can understand status and decision needs in ≤ 60 seconds.

### 5) Create an escalation + ask plan (use leaders as resources)
- **Inputs:** blockers, dependencies, stakeholders.
- **Actions:** Define escalation triggers, pre-wire plan, and an “ask ladder” (from lightweight FYI → unblock → sponsor → decision). Translate blockers into specific leader actions.
- **Outputs:** Escalation triggers + ask ladder + leverage map.
- **Checks:** Each “ask” is actionable and time-bounded, not a vague request for help.

### 6) Align expectations + set boundaries (respectfully)
- **Inputs:** mismatches (pace, scope, availability), examples.
- **Actions:** Draft a working agreement and boundary script: clarify expectations, propose alternatives, and secure explicit agreement. Prepare “pushback” language for unreasonable requests (times, scope, urgency).
- **Outputs:** Working agreement + scripts (short, copy/paste).
- **Checks:** Boundaries are framed as protecting outcomes (quality, speed, sustainability), not personal preferences.

### 7) Build influence: seat-at-the-table loop
- **Inputs:** strategy calendar, decisions, adjacent teams.
- **Actions:** Create a plan to contribute at the business level: pre-reads, crisp POVs, trade-off framing, and consistent pre-briefs. Identify 1–2 high-leverage forums and how to earn invitation.
- **Outputs:** Influence plan (30 days) + artifacts to share (POV note, decision memo).
- **Checks:** Plan includes at least one recurring “strategic contribution” touchpoint per week.

### 8) Quality gate + 4-week pilot + iteration plan
- **Inputs:** full draft pack.
- **Actions:** Run [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and score with [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md). Add **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**. Propose a 4-week pilot and a retro prompt set.
- **Outputs:** Final Managing Up Operating System Pack.
- **Checks:** Pack is immediately usable; next interactions are scheduled (cadence + checkpoints).

## Quality gate (required)
- Use [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md).
- Always include: **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**.

## Examples

**Example 1 (new relationship):** “I started a new PM role. Help me manage up with my manager: create a manager profile template, a weekly update format, and a 4-week pilot cadence.”  
Expected: manager profile + cadence + weekly update template + pilot plan + risks/open questions/next steps.

**Example 2 (exec misalignment):** “Our exec team keeps changing priorities and feels out of touch. Create an exec-ready weekly update and a trade-off memo template so I can escalate issues early and frame decisions.”  
Expected: weekly update + decision/trade-off memo + escalation triggers + comms map.

**Boundary example:** “My manager is retaliating against me and I need to document it.”  
Response: recommend HR/legal/company process; offer to create a factual incident timeline template and a neutral summary, but do not provide legal advice.
