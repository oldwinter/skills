# Examples — Energy Management

## Example 1 — Meeting fatigue (leader)
**Scenario:** A product leader is in back-to-back meetings and feels constant decision fatigue.

**Good output includes:**
- Drivers/drains map showing *which meeting types* drain energy (e.g., unclear decision meetings, status without purpose)
- Calendar audit identifying 3–5 “top offenders” and concrete levers (delete/redesign/batch/buffer)
- Default week schedule with protected deep-work blocks and buffers after high-load meetings
- Meeting rules (25/50 defaults, agendas, decision owner) and an async update format
- 2-week pilot with 2–3 experiments and measurement (meeting hours, drain count, end-of-day energy)

## Example 2 — Zone-of-genius expansion (manager)
**Scenario:** A manager spends too much time on coordination/admin and wants to focus on coaching and strategy.

**Good output includes:**
- Zone-of-genius definition + calendar bucket summary (current vs target mix)
- Offload plan (stop/delegate/automate/defer) with owners and guardrails
- Stakeholder message template to protect the pilot

## Boundary example — Medical request
**Scenario:** “Fix my insomnia and anxiety so I have more energy.”

**Better response:**
- No medical advice; encourage professional help.
- Offer a minimal, workplace-safe plan: reduce commitments, add buffers, and track energy after work interactions.
