# Running Effective 1:1s

## Scope

**Covers**
- Designing a lightweight **1:1 operating system** (purpose, cadence, meeting types, shared docs)
- Running 1:1s as **coaching conversations** (not just status updates)
- Holding **career development** conversations (life story → future dreams → action plan)
- Doing basic **wellbeing/recovery** check-ins (joy/energy) without crossing into therapy/medical advice
- Running **skip-levels** and special sessions (e.g., post-crisis “make them feel heard” 1:1s)

**When to use**
- “My 1:1s are turning into status updates—help me redesign them.”
- “Create a 1:1 agenda + shared doc template for me and my direct reports.”
- “I’m a new manager—set up my 1:1 cadence and question bank.”
- “Help me run better career conversations in 1:1s.”
- “Plan a skip-level program and templates.”

**When NOT to use**
- You need HR/legal guidance, an investigation, or a performance improvement plan (involve HR/legal; use your company process)
- You need a project status meeting cadence (use team/ops rituals; 1:1s should not be the primary status channel)
- The situation involves immediate safety/mental health crisis (seek professional help and follow company policy)

## Inputs

**Minimum required**
- Your role and context (manager level, org type, function, time zones)
- Who the 1:1s are for (directs, skip-levels) and relationship stage (new, stable, strained)
- Current 1:1 cadence and what’s not working (2–5 concrete examples)
- What you want to change (coaching, feedback, career growth, wellbeing, alignment, retention)
- Constraints: meeting load, confidentiality/PII rules, any HR policies, time box/deadline

**Missing-info strategy**
- Ask up to 5 questions from [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md) (3–5 at a time).
- If key details are missing, proceed with a **default 1:1 operating system** and clearly label assumptions.
- Do not request secrets or sensitive personal data; use anonymized summaries.

## Outputs (deliverables)

Produce a **1:1 Operating System Pack** in Markdown (in-chat; or as files if requested):

1) **Context + goals** (what 1:1s are for in this team; what they are not for)
2) **Cadence + meeting types plan** (weekly/biweekly + barbell approach + skip-level cadence)
3) **Shared 1:1 doc templates** (agenda, notes, action items, topics backlog)
4) **Coaching toolkit** (conversation rules + question bank + “coach vs advisor” prompts)
5) **Career development conversation plan** (life story → dreams → action plan, with templates)
6) **Wellbeing/recovery check-in pattern** (joy/energy prompts + boundaries + escalation guidance)
7) **Special-situation playbooks** (post-crisis listening session; urgent topical meeting; skip-level template)
8) **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** (always included)

## Workflow (8 steps)

### 1) Intake + boundaries + safety
- **Inputs:** user context; [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md).
- **Actions:** Confirm goals for 1:1s, current failure modes, constraints, and any HR/safety boundaries. Decide which deliverables are needed (full pack vs just templates).
- **Outputs:** Context snapshot + assumptions/unknowns list.
- **Checks:** The purpose of 1:1s is explicit and does not conflict with HR/legal policy.

### 2) Define the 1:1 purpose and “what goes where”
- **Inputs:** goals + failure modes.
- **Actions:** Separate topics into channels: team status rituals vs 1:1 coaching, career, feedback, and blockers. Define what the 1:1 should consistently cover (and what it should not).
- **Outputs:** “What goes where” map + 1:1 purpose statement.
- **Checks:** Status updates have a non-1:1 home (async or team ritual).

### 3) Choose cadence + meeting types (barbell design)
- **Inputs:** roster, seniority, relationship needs, time budget.
- **Actions:** Propose a cadence plan: standing 1:1s where they add value, plus a **barbell approach** (high-quality relationship catch-ups + urgent topical meetings). Add a skip-level cadence if needed.
- **Outputs:** Cadence + meeting types plan.
- **Checks:** The plan reduces meeting bloat while improving timeliness and relationship quality.

### 4) Create the shared 1:1 documentation system
- **Inputs:** tools available (doc, notes, tracker), privacy constraints.
- **Actions:** Define a shared doc per report (or per relationship) with: agenda, running topics backlog, notes, decisions, and action items. Include a pre-work expectation for both sides.
- **Outputs:** Shared 1:1 doc template + action item tracker conventions.
- **Checks:** Every meeting ends with written next steps and owners; sensitive content is handled appropriately.

### 5) Shift from “advisor” to “coach” (conversation rules)
- **Inputs:** common problem types brought to 1:1s.
- **Actions:** Write a coaching toolkit: default questions, how to avoid jumping to answers, and how to help the report reason through tradeoffs. Include a “when to be directive” exception list (risk, safety, time-critical).
- **Outputs:** Coaching rules + question bank.
- **Checks:** The toolkit trains independent problem solving rather than escalating everything to the manager.

### 6) Build a career development sequence (3 conversations)
- **Inputs:** role expectations, growth paths, aspirations (if known).
- **Actions:** Create a career plan that schedules three deeper conversations: **Life Story**, **Future Dreams**, **Career Action Plan**. Define how tactical 1:1s connect to growth over time.
- **Outputs:** Career conversation plan + templates.
- **Checks:** The plan results in 1–3 concrete growth bets and follow-up checkpoints.

### 7) Add wellbeing/recovery + special situations
- **Inputs:** team stress level, recent change events, relationship health.
- **Actions:** Add a lightweight joy/energy check-in pattern and a “behavioral activations” list. Add special playbooks: post-crisis listening session (feel heard), urgent topical meeting, and skip-level structure.
- **Outputs:** Wellbeing pattern + special-situation playbooks + templates.
- **Checks:** Boundaries are clear (not therapy); escalation paths are documented.

### 8) Quality gate + rollout plan
- **Inputs:** full draft pack.
- **Actions:** Run [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and score with [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md). Add **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**. Propose a 2–4 week pilot with review prompts.
- **Outputs:** Final 1:1 Operating System Pack.
- **Checks:** Pack is immediately usable; responsibilities and follow-ups are explicit.

## Quality gate (required)
- Use [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md).
- Always include: **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**.

## Examples

**Example 1 (new manager):** “I’m a new product lead with 6 direct reports across time zones. Design my 1:1 cadence, a shared 1:1 doc template, and a coaching question bank. Include a career conversation plan and a 4-week pilot.”  
Expected: cadence plan + templates + coaching toolkit + career sequence + quality gates.

**Example 2 (meeting bloat):** “My calendar is overloaded with weekly 1:1s. I still want strong relationships and fast escalation on urgent topics. Propose a barbell approach, updated agendas, and a skip-level cadence.”  
Expected: reduced standing roster with explicit alternatives; relationship catch-ups + urgent topical meetings; skip-level template.

**Boundary example:** “I need to document poor performance and start a PIP.”  
Response: recommend HR/performance management process; offer to help create a feedback conversation plan and expectations doc, but not to run an HR process via 1:1 templates.
