# Examples

**Example 1 (new manager):** “I’m a new product lead with 6 direct reports across time zones. Design my 1:1 cadence, a shared 1:1 doc template, and a coaching question bank. Include a career conversation plan and a 4-week pilot.”  
Expected: cadence plan + templates + coaching toolkit + career sequence + quality gates.

**Example 2 (meeting bloat):** “My calendar is overloaded with weekly 1:1s. I still want strong relationships and fast escalation on urgent topics. Propose a barbell approach, updated agendas, and a skip-level cadence.”  
Expected: reduced standing roster with explicit alternatives; relationship catch-ups + urgent topical meetings; skip-level template.

**Boundary example:** “I need to document poor performance and start a PIP.”  
Response: recommend HR/performance management process; offer to help create a feedback conversation plan and expectations doc, but not to run an HR process via 1:1 templates.
