# Intake (Question Bank)

Use this to gather the minimum information required to produce a 1:1 Operating System Pack. Ask **3–5 questions at a time**.

## 1) Your context
1) What’s your role and scope (team/function, level, number of reports)?
2) What’s the working model (remote/hybrid/in-office) and time zones?
3) Any constraints: meeting load, privacy/PII rules, HR policies, upcoming deadlines?

## 2) Who the 1:1s are for
4) Who are the 1:1s with (direct reports? dotted-line? skip-levels)? How many?
5) How long have you worked together (new, stable, strained)?
6) Any roles/levels that require a different cadence (new hire, low performer, very senior)?

## 3) Current state + failure modes
7) What’s your current cadence and format (length, agenda, shared doc or not)?
8) What’s not working? Share 2–5 anonymized examples (e.g., “always status”, “no follow-through”, “surprises”).
9) What do you want to be *more true* in 4–8 weeks (coaching, clarity, morale, growth, retention, execution)?

## 4) Topic mix + channel design
10) Where does status/live execution get tracked today (async docs, standups, project tools)?
11) What topics must be covered in 1:1s (career, feedback, blockers, wellbeing, alignment)?
12) Any topics that should NOT be in 1:1s (compliance, HR, confidential investigations)?

## 5) Career development
13) Do you want a structured career conversation sequence (life story → dreams → plan)? If yes, what’s your timeline?
14) Do you have a career ladder, competencies, or role expectations to reference?

## 6) Special situations
15) Are you planning skip-levels? If yes: goals (signal gathering vs coaching), population, cadence, and how notes should be handled.
16) Any recent org change or crisis (layoffs, reorg, incident) that requires a listening-first 1:1?

## 7) Tools
17) What tooling do you prefer for shared docs (Google Docs/Notion/Confluence) and action tracking (Jira/Asana/Trello)?
18) Any constraints on sharing docs with reports (e.g., manager-only notes vs shared notes)?
