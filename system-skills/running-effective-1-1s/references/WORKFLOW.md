# Expanded Workflow: Running Effective 1:1s

This file expands the workflow in `SKILL.md` with practical heuristics and copy/paste building blocks.

## Principles to follow (rules + checks)

### 1) Coach, don’t bottleneck
- **Rule:** Default to coaching questions before giving answers; use “advisor mode” only when risk/time demands it.
- **Check:** Over 4 weeks, the same problem type is not repeatedly escalated without the report trying options first.

### 2) Status has a different home
- **Rule:** Do not let 1:1s become the primary status channel; create a separate async/team ritual.
- **Check:** 1:1 notes show decisions, risks, growth, and unblocking—not a replay of ticket lists.

### 3) Career conversations need dedicated time
- **Rule:** Schedule deeper career sessions (life story → dreams → action plan) distinct from weekly tactical 1:1s.
- **Check:** Each report has 1–3 written growth bets and a review checkpoint on the calendar.

### 4) Use a barbell approach to time
- **Rule:** Combine fewer high-quality relationship catch-ups (walk/coffee) with timely, urgent topical meetings.
- **Check:** Calendar load drops while time-to-escalate urgent issues improves (fewer “we should have talked sooner” moments).

### 5) Monitor recovery/joy as a performance input
- **Rule:** Ask about energy/joy and treat persistent “no joy” as a risk signal that requires a plan.
- **Check:** There is a lightweight activation plan (small actions) and boundaries/escalation are documented.

### 6) In crisis, listen first
- **Rule:** After major change, run a listening-only 1:1 focused on thoughts/feelings; avoid status and problem solving.
- **Check:** The report can say they felt heard; action items (if any) are limited to support and clarity, not execution.

## Step-by-step guidance

### Step 2: “What goes where” map (example)
Use this to prevent 1:1s from turning into status meetings:
- **Team ritual / async channel:** project status, sprint updates, cross-functional coordination, broad announcements
- **1:1:** coaching, decision support, feedback, career growth, wellbeing, sensitive blockers, relationship building
- **Urgent topical meeting:** time-sensitive decisions, incident response, immediate escalation
- **Skip-level:** signal gathering, coaching at a distance, culture/health checks (not bypassing the manager)

### Step 3: Cadence heuristics
Default starting points (adjust to your context):
- **New manager ↔ new report:** 45–60 min weekly for 4–8 weeks, then reassess
- **Stable relationship:** 30–45 min biweekly
- **Senior/independent report:** 30–45 min every 2–4 weeks + ad-hoc topical meetings
- **Relationship under stress / major change:** temporarily increase cadence and add a listening session

Barbell approach patterns:
- Replace some standing 1:1s with a monthly relationship catch-up (walk/coffee; no laptop).
- Keep “fast path” escalation: a 15–30 min topical meeting within 48 hours for urgent issues.

### Step 4: Shared doc guidance
Shared doc rules:
- Keep one doc per manager-report pair (or per quarter), with a running topic backlog.
- Both people add agenda items before the meeting.
- End each meeting with explicit next steps: owner + due date (or next checkpoint).

Manager-private vs shared notes:
- Prefer shared notes by default (build trust).
- If you keep private notes, do not store sensitive personal info; keep it factual and job-relevant.

### Step 5: Coaching toolkit (mini scripts)

When a report brings a problem:
1) “What outcome do you want?”  
2) “What options have you considered?”  
3) “What would you do if I wasn’t available?”  
4) “What’s the riskiest assumption here?”  
5) “What decision do you need to make, and by when?”  

When you disagree:
- “Talk me through your reasoning.”  
- “What data would change your mind?”  
- “What’s the smallest test we can run this week?”  

When to be directive (exceptions):
- Safety, legal/HR policy, ethical issues
- Time-critical incidents
- Repeated patterns where expectations were already clearly set

### Step 6: Career conversations (how to run)

Life Story (45–60 min)
- Goal: understand what motivates them and what shaped their choices.
- Output: 3–5 themes + motivation drivers.

Future Dreams (45–60 min)
- Goal: list 3–4 plausible long-term visions (not a single “answer”).
- Output: 3–4 dreams + what’s appealing about each.

Career Action Plan (45–60 min)
- Goal: pick 1–3 growth bets and turn them into practice loops.
- Output: growth bets, projects to seek, skills to build, and monthly checkpoints.

### Step 7: Wellbeing/recovery (boundaries)
Use “joy/energy” check-ins to spot risk, not to diagnose:
- If someone reports persistent burnout symptoms, encourage using company support resources and professional care.
- If workload is the driver, adjust scope, priorities, or expectations; write it down.

### Step 7: Skip-levels (do’s/don’ts)
- **Do:** clarify purpose; protect the manager-report relationship; share themes, not quotes/names.
- **Don’t:** ask for performance gossip; promise confidentiality you can’t keep; bypass the manager on decisions.
