## What the original skill emphasized (preserved)

1) **Read visceral reactions to find what resonates (Wes Kao)**  
Preserved as: Pre-brief loop guidance to capture “what landed vs didn’t land” in `../SKILL.md` Step 6 and the pre-brief notes template in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md).

2) **Stakeholders won’t “know it when they see it” (David Placek)**  
Preserved as: Expectation-setting to evaluate against criteria (not gut feel) in `../SKILL.md` Step 5 and [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) principles.

3) **Understand how leaders think, not just what they think (Hilary Gridley)**  
Preserved as: “How they think” notes and decision principles in `../SKILL.md` Step 3 and the stakeholder map template in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md).

4) **Earn trust by understanding business constraints (Marty Cagan)**  
Preserved as: Explicit constraints framing (compliance, privacy, security, monetization, GTM) in `../SKILL.md` Step 4 and checklists in [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md).

5) **Cut through complexity with one vital, user-centric question (Shreyas Doshi)**  
Preserved as: Vital question anchor in `../SKILL.md` Step 4 and templates in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md).

## What was added to make it agent-executable
- A concrete **Stakeholder Alignment Pack** output contract (brief, stakeholder map, alignment plan, pre-read + meeting plan, decision comms).
- A step-by-step workflow with checks (8 steps) that prevents “alignment drift”.
- Checklists + rubric for a ship/no-ship quality gate.
