# Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing the Stakeholder Alignment Pack.

## 1) Alignment target checklist (anti-vagueness)
- “Alignment” is defined as **inform / align / decide**, with a date.
- The decision/ask can be stated in **one sentence**.
- Scope boundaries and non-negotiables are explicit.

## 2) Stakeholder map checklist (no hidden vetoes)
- A **Decider** (or decision body) is named.
- Approvers/influencers/implementers/blockers are identified (not just “stakeholders”).
- Likely silent-veto risks are called out (teams not consulted but impacted).
- Each key stakeholder has: what they care about + likely objection + what evidence persuades them.

## 3) “How they think” checklist (principles over opinions)
- For each key stakeholder, you have 3–7 decision principles (how they evaluate decisions).
- Conflicting viewpoints are translated into “in what world does this make sense?”
- You can predict the top 3 questions each key stakeholder will ask.

## 4) Narrative + criteria checklist (cut through noise)
- The pack includes a **vital question** that anchors the conversation.
- User value and business constraints are explicit (compliance, security, GTM, monetization, reliability).
- Criteria are limited (3–7) and reflect real tradeoffs (not “everything matters”).
- Assumptions are labeled as assumptions (and have an evidence plan if high-stakes).

## 5) Pre-brief loop checklist (no surprises)
- The decider and likely blockers were pre-briefed before the live meeting.
- Pre-brief notes capture what landed vs didn’t land (signals), objections, and commitments.
- A change log exists (what changed and why).
- No key stakeholder sees the core ask for the first time in the live meeting.

## 6) Meeting + comms checklist (commitments, not vibes)
- The meeting starts with the alignment target and ends with a clear decision/next step.
- Dissent is recorded (not smoothed over), with follow-ups and owners.
- Follow-up comms includes: decision, rationale, tradeoffs, owners, dates, and review checkpoint.

## 7) Required final section
- The final output includes: **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**.
