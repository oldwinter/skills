# Workflow Notes (Expanded Guidance)

Use this file as a deeper playbook for the workflow in `../SKILL.md`.

## Principles (rules + checks)

1) **Alignment is commitments, not vibes.**  
Rule: Never end an “alignment meeting” without a decision/next step, owners, and dates.  
Check: Can every attendee say what changes tomorrow?

2) **No surprises.**  
Rule: Pre-brief the decider + likely blockers before the live meeting.  
Check: Nobody says “This is the first I’m hearing of this” about the core ask.

3) **Understand how leaders think (principles), not just what they think (opinions).**  
Rule: Translate stakeholder feedback into decision principles + evidence preferences.  
Check: You can predict their top questions and what would change their mind.

4) **Expect discomfort; optimize for criteria, not gut feel.**  
Rule: Set expectations that “the right answer might feel uncomfortable at first” (especially in naming/strategy).  
Check: Stakeholders evaluate options against criteria, not first impressions.

5) **Cut through complexity with a vital question anchored in user value.**  
Rule: Open the conversation with a simple, user-centric question (and keep returning to it).  
Check: If the meeting derails into implementation trivia, the vital question recenters it.

6) **Earn trust by respecting real constraints.**  
Rule: Make business constraints explicit (legal/compliance, monetization, GTM, security, reliability).  
Check: Risk-focused stakeholders see their concerns reflected accurately in the brief.

## Common failure modes (and fixes)

### 1) “We’re aligned” → re-litigation the next day
- Likely cause: no written decision capture; dissent not recorded; owners unclear.
- Fix: send a decision summary within 24 hours and include a review checkpoint date.

### 2) Stakeholders argue past each other
- Likely cause: different decision principles (risk vs growth vs quality) are implicit.
- Fix: write down principles and criteria; ask “In what world does this objection make sense?”

### 3) Meetings drift into implementation details
- Likely cause: no clear decision target or criteria; “how” debates stand in for “what/why”.
- Fix: restate decision, vital question, and criteria; park implementation questions with owners.

### 4) Surprise blockers appear late
- Likely cause: missing stakeholder map; no pre-brief loop; hidden vetoes.
- Fix: map stakeholders by function; pre-brief decider + risk functions early.

## How to observe alignment signals (practical)

During pre-briefs and meetings, capture signals:
- What caused visible interest (energy, faster follow-ups, deeper questions)?
- What caused disengagement (“dead eyes”, topic switching, vague approval)?
- Which words/frames did stakeholders repeat back (evidence it landed)?

Use the pre-brief notes template in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md) to log signals and adjust messaging.

## Suggested question prompts (copy/paste)

### To decode decision principles
- “What’s the most important thing you optimize for in decisions like this?”
- “What risks are you most worried about here?”
- “What would make this an obvious ‘yes’ for you?”
- “What evidence would change your mind?”

### To set expectations and reduce bikeshedding
- “Let’s agree on criteria first; we’ll evaluate options against them.”
- “Initial discomfort is normal—let’s focus on what works for users and the business.”

### To anchor on user value
- “How does this make our users/customers meaningfully better off?”
- “What user pain does this remove, and how will we know?”
