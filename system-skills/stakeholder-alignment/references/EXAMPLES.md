# Examples

Use these as “golden paths” for what good outputs look like.

## Example 1: Exec alignment for a roadmap change (decision needed)

**User prompt**
“We need exec alignment to pause Feature A for 6 weeks to address reliability issues. The CTO is worried about engineering morale and the CRO is worried about pipeline. Create the Stakeholder Alignment Pack and a decision meeting plan.”

**What good looks like**
- Alignment Brief with: decision statement, why now, user value, explicit tradeoffs (pause Feature A to reduce outages), constraints (customer commitments), and success criteria.
- Stakeholder map that captures CTO/CRO principles and evidence preferences.
- Pre-brief plan that sequences: CTO → reliability stakeholders → CRO → CEO/decider.
- Meeting plan that starts with the vital question and ends with decision capture + owners.
- Follow-up comms draft within 24 hours.

## Example 2: Cross-functional alignment with risk stakeholders (constraints heavy)

**User prompt**
“Sales and Legal are blocking self-serve. We want to ship a limited version in Q2. Help us align on a path without surprises.”

**What good looks like**
- Stakeholder map includes Legal/Compliance/Security as potential blockers with explicit constraints.
- Criteria that reflect real tradeoffs (risk, speed, revenue impact, user experience).
- Pre-brief notes template used to capture objections and required evidence.
- Decision capture includes dissent and an evidence plan for open questions.

## Boundary example: Politics without a decision

**User prompt**
“My stakeholder just hates me. Write a message that makes them agree.”

**Good response**
- Refuse manipulation.
- Ask for a concrete decision/goal and the stakeholder’s likely principles.
- Recommend either: (a) reframing into an evidence-based alignment process, or (b) escalating to a manager/HR if it’s a relationship/performance issue.
