Designing Team Rituals  Team rituals are the recurring practices that define how a team operates and embeds culture into daily work. Great companies have a small number of 'golden rituals' that every employee knows. These aren't just meetings - they're named, templated practices that serve as the engine of operational efficiency and culture.

Read Guide

The Guide  4 key steps synthesized from 2 experts.

1 Name your rituals  Great rituals have names. Naming creates shared language, makes the ritual memorable, and signals that this practice is intentional and important. If you can't name it, it's just a meeting. Named rituals become part of company culture in a way that generic meetings never do.

Featured guest perspectives

"Great companies has a very small list of golden rituals. And there are three rules of golden rituals. Number one, they're named. Number two, every employee knows them by their first Friday and, number three, they're templated."

— Shishir Mehrotra        2 Make rituals known by the first Friday  If a ritual matters, new employees should learn about it in their first week. This tests whether the ritual is truly central to how you operate or just something that happens occasionally. Golden rituals are so fundamental that onboarding is incomplete without them.

— Shishir Mehrotra        3 Template your rituals for consistency  Golden rituals follow a consistent template so everyone knows what to expect and how to participate. This isn't bureaucracy - it's efficiency. Templates reduce coordination cost, ensure nothing falls through the cracks, and make it easy to onboard new participants.

— Shishir Mehrotra        4 Design rituals that are personal to your team  The best rituals aren't copied from other companies - they emerge from your specific context and values. Document what works for your team and iterate on it. These become your team's unique operating system, not a generic framework applied from outside.

"I think the rituals that I've been writing down are very personal. They're my take on how to do this."
