# system-skills/tools-skills

## OVERVIEW
Tooling and “how-to” skills (codegen helpers, UI guidelines, best practices docs, changelog tooling).

## WHERE TO LOOK
| Task | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| React/Next performance rules | `vercel-react-best-practices/` | Some skills include large `AGENTS.md` as rule docs.
| Postgres/Supabase best practices | `supabase-postgres-best-practices/` | Large rule doc.
| Justfile automation | `justfile/SKILL.md` + `scripts/` |
| Skills README regeneration | `skills-readme-updater/SKILL.md` + `scripts/` |

## CONVENTIONS
- Expect heterogeneous layouts: some are mostly `SKILL.md`, others are doc-heavy (`rules/`, `references/`).
