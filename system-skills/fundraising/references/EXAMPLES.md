# Examples

**Example 1 (pre-seed):** “We’re 2 founders building a B2B workflow tool. We have 5 design partners and 2 pilots. We have 6 months runway and want to raise $1.5–2.0M. Use `fundraising` to produce the full Fundraising Pack including a deck outline and investor pipeline tracker.”  
Expected: decision memo + round design + deck outline (strong first slide) + target list + outreach scripts.

**Example 2 (seed with traction):** “We’re at $60k MRR and growing 10% MoM. We’re debating whether to raise now or wait 6 months. Use `fundraising` to help us decide and create an outreach plan if we choose to raise.”  
Expected: raise-vs-wait decision memo with criteria + round design options + pipeline plan.

**Boundary example:** “Draft a SAFE agreement and tell me what valuation I should take.”  
Response: out of scope for legal/pricing advice; offer to produce the negotiation inputs (round design assumptions, comps proxy approach, questions for counsel) and a fundraising process plan.
