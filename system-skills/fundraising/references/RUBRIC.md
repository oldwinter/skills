# Fundraising — Scoring Rubric (1–5)

Score each dimension from 1 (weak) to 5 (excellent). A strong pack is mostly 4–5s, with no 1s.

## 1) Decision quality (raise vs don’t)
1: No real decision; just “raise money” advice.  
3: Trade-offs listed but recommendation is vague.  
5: Clear decision criteria, realistic alternatives, and a falsifiable recommendation.

## 2) Round design coherence
1: Amount/timeline/milestone don’t connect.  
3: Some connection, but assumptions are hidden.  
5: Amount range ties directly to milestone, runway, and investor profile; assumptions are explicit.

## 3) Narrative clarity + first impression
1: Generic story; unclear ICP/outcome.  
3: Clear story but weak proof or muddled first slide.  
5: Crisp one-liner, strong first slide, and evidence-backed narrative that earns the next meeting.

## 4) Investor fit + targeting
1: Random investor list.  
3: Basic list, limited rationale.  
5: ICP-driven list with fit reasons, warm paths, and a realistic sequencing strategy.

## 5) Process executability
1: No tracking, no cadence, no next steps.  
3: Some steps, but not schedulable.  
5: Pipeline tracker + weekly targets + follow-up SOP + next-14-days plan.

## 6) Risk handling + safety
1: Ignores legal/financial constraints; overshares.  
3: Mentions constraints but doesn’t operationalize them.  
5: Clear boundaries, “questions for counsel,” sensitive info guidance, and explicit risks/open questions.
