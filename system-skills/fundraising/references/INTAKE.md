# Fundraising — Intake (Question Bank)

Ask **3–5 questions at a time**. If the user can’t answer, accept ranges and label assumptions.

## Fast intake (answer in 5–10 minutes)

1) What are you building, for whom, and what is the painful problem you solve?
2) What stage are you at (idea / pre-seed / seed / A / other) and what proof do you have today?
3) What traction metrics can you share (even proxies): revenue, growth, retention, pipeline, usage, LOIs, pilots, waitlist?
4) Who is the team (founders + key roles), and what is your “earned secret”/advantage?
5) What is your runway (months), and what constraints do you have (time, geography, intros, risk tolerance)?

## Fundraising intent + decision context

6) Why are you considering raising now? What happens if you don’t raise?
7) What does success look like 12–18 months from now (milestone you want the round to buy)?
8) What are the main trade-offs you’re worried about (dilution, control, speed, expectations, focus)?
9) What alternative paths are plausible (revenue-first, delay, angels, strategic, debt, grants)?

## Round design (if raising)

10) Target amount (range) and target close date (or window)?
11) Preferred instrument (SAFE/note/equity) if known (if not, we’ll treat this as a question for counsel).
12) Current burn + planned burn (or hiring plan) and what the money is for.
13) Target investor type: angels, micro-VCs, seed funds, strategic, geo constraints.
14) Who can credibly intro you (names optional; roles/community is enough)?

## Pitch + process readiness

15) What is the single strongest “hook” or insight that makes your company inevitable (why now)?
16) What are the top 3 objections you expect (market size, differentiation, GTM, team, churn, regulation)?
17) What assets exist today (deck, doc, metrics, demo, customer quotes, data room)?
18) What is your weekly time budget for fundraising, and who owns the process?

## Optional (helps a lot)

19) What comparable companies or categories do investors reference when you explain the business?
20) What has happened in past fundraising attempts (if any): what worked, what didn’t, what feedback was consistent?
