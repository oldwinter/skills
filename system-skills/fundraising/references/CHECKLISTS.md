# Fundraising — Quality Checklists

Use this before finalizing any Fundraising Pack.

## 1) Raise Decision Memo checklist
- [ ] Clearly states the decision and deadline
- [ ] Explicitly names the “venture treadmill” trade-offs (expectations, dilution, pace)
- [ ] Includes a credible non-VC alternative path (bootstrap/delay/other) instead of hand-waving
- [ ] Recommendation includes a falsifiable criterion (“we raise if X by date Y”)
- [ ] Risks, open questions, and next steps are present

## 2) Round Design Brief checklist
- [ ] Raise amount is a range (unless user provided an exact number)
- [ ] Amount is tied to a specific 12–18 month milestone
- [ ] Use of funds is coherent (headcount + key bets + buffer)
- [ ] Target investor profile matches the round (stage/check size/thesis/geo)
- [ ] Flags legal/tax items as “questions for counsel” (no pretending to advise)

## 3) Pitch narrative + deck outline checklist
- [ ] One-liner is specific (ICP + outcome)
- [ ] Slide 1 communicates strongest point in ~10 seconds
- [ ] Deck answers: problem, why now, solution, proof, GTM, differentiation, team, ask
- [ ] Claims are supported by evidence (metrics/proxies/customer quotes)
- [ ] Talk track exists for a 2–3 minute opener

## 4) Investor pipeline + outreach system checklist
- [ ] Investor ICP includes both fit filters and “avoid” filters
- [ ] Target list includes a warm path (even if “unknown” for now)
- [ ] Pipeline stages are defined and trackable
- [ ] Weekly activity targets exist and match time budget
- [ ] Outreach scripts are ready-to-send and not overly long
- [ ] Follow-up SOP (within 24 hours) is explicit

## 5) Diligence readiness checklist
- [ ] Data room index is realistic for stage (not overbuilt)
- [ ] FAQ/objection table covers top 3–5 expected objections
- [ ] Sensitive info handling is explicit (what not to share yet; redactions)

## 6) Final pack checklist
- [ ] Outputs appear in the required order from `../SKILL.md`
- [ ] Assumptions are labeled; unknowns are called out
- [ ] Includes: Risks / Open questions / Next steps
- [ ] Next 14 days have concrete actions scheduled
