# Checklists (Quality Gate)

Use these before finalizing the Design System Operating Pack.

## A) Scope + assumptions
- [ ] The system’s audiences are explicit (designers/engineers/PMs/non-designers).
- [ ] In-scope vs out-of-scope is clear (no hidden work).
- [ ] Stakeholders and decision-maker(s) are explicit.
- [ ] Assumptions are labeled (platforms, stack, tooling, timeline).

## B) Operational hook + first slice
- [ ] The “operational blocker” is stated in plain language.
- [ ] The first slice is narrow enough to ship but pattern-setting.
- [ ] Success signals include adoption and at least one speed/quality metric.

## C) Blockframes (logic before styling)
- [ ] Key flows have lo-fi blockframes or an equivalent structural spec.
- [ ] Blockframes map blocks → components/patterns (not just rectangles).
- [ ] Key states (loading/empty/error/disabled/focus) are considered where relevant.

## D) Token model quality
- [ ] Token taxonomy and naming rules are documented.
- [ ] Semantic tokens are used (not raw colors/values in specs).
- [ ] Elevation/depth and state tokens exist (or a deliberate decision not to).
- [ ] Accessibility constraints are addressed (contrast, focus, reduced motion).

## E) Component model + roadmap
- [ ] Components are tiered (primitives/composites/patterns).
- [ ] Roadmap prioritizes reuse + user impact (not convenience).
- [ ] Milestones have acceptance criteria and a rollback/stop condition.

## F) Documentation + ease-of-use
- [ ] Docs are example-first and include do/don’t guidance.
- [ ] Templates/recipes exist so non-experts can produce consistent UI.
- [ ] The system has sensible defaults and constrained variants (guardrails).

## G) Governance + adoption
- [ ] Decision rights are explicit (tokens, components, visual direction).
- [ ] Contribution workflow is clear (proposal → review → release).
- [ ] Adoption plan includes champions/office hours and migration support.

## H) Finalization
- [ ] Risks, open questions, and next steps are included at the end.
- [ ] No secrets/credentials were requested or recorded.
