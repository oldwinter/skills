# Pricing Strategy — Templates

Use these templates to produce the Pricing Strategy Pack as Markdown (in-chat or as files).

## Template 1: Pricing Strategy Pack (master outline)

### 1) Context snapshot
- Decision:
- Timeline:
- Audience / decision-makers:
- Product + use case:
- Segments (primary 1–3):
- Motion (self-serve / sales-led / hybrid):
- Current pricing (if any):
- Objective metrics:
- Guardrails:
- Constraints (billing/contracts/compliance/brand):

### 2) Segment map + value narrative
| Segment | Buyer | User | Primary job-to-be-done | Value outcomes | Key risks/constraints | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### 3) Value metric options
| Candidate value metric | Why it matches value | Pros | Cons/risks | Best-fit segments | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### 4) Packaging & plans (draft)
| Plan | Who it’s for | Included value | Limits (aligned to value) | Upgrade triggers | Price (placeholder) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Add-ons (optional):**
- Add-on:
- Who buys it:
- Price logic:
- Operational notes:

### 5) WTP evidence plan
- Hypotheses (by segment/plan):
- What we need to learn first (ranges, not exact numbers):
- Target participants (count, roles, segments):
- Method mix (interviews, survey, pilot offers):
- Risks/biases and how we’ll mitigate:

**Interview prompts (copy/paste):**
- “Walk me through the moment you first felt this product was ‘must-have’.”
- “What happens if you don’t solve this problem?”
- “What alternatives did you consider? What did they cost (time/money/risk)?”
- “What would you expect to pay for outcomes like this? Why?”
- “What would make it feel ‘too expensive’ vs ‘suspiciously cheap’?”
- “If we charged by <value metric>, what would feel fair/unfair?”

### 6) Price-point options + recommendation
| Option | Plan prices | Notes | Who wins/loses | Risks | Mitigations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Discount / annual policy (draft):**
- Annual discount:
- Eligibility / enforcement:
- Sales assist triggers (when humans get involved):

### 7) Conversion mechanics plan (trial + sampling)
- Trial type (free trial / reverse trial / capped trial / freemium-only):
- What premium value is sampled (where in the flow):
- Guardrails (limits, abuse controls):
- Success metrics (conversion + retention + expansion):

**Experiment backlog (table):**
| Experiment | Hypothesis | Segment | Metric | Duration | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### 8) Rollout + instrumentation
- Rollout approach (phased, geo, cohorts):
- Migration rules (grandfathering, proration, contract handling):
- Comms plan (email/in-app/support/sales):
- Instrumentation (events, dashboards):
- KPIs and guardrails:
- Rollback criteria + playbook:

### 9) Risks / Open questions / Next steps
- Risks:
- Open questions:
- Next steps (owners + dates, if known):

## Template 2: Self-serve vs sales-led boundary (mini)
| Boundary trigger | Why it forces sales assist | Detection signal | Recommended path | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Template 3: Pricing review cadence (mini)
- Cadence: (default: every 6–12 months)
- Triggers to revisit:
- Owner(s):
- Required inputs (metrics + research):
- Decision forum:
