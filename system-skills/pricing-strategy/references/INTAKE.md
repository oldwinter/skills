# Pricing Strategy — Intake (Question Bank)

Use this to collect the minimum information needed to produce a Pricing Strategy Pack. Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**.

## If you only answer 5 questions, answer these
1) What is the product, for whom, and the primary job-to-be-done?
2) What pricing decision are we making, and by when (new pricing vs repricing vs packaging vs trial)?
3) What is the current pricing (plans/price points/value metric/trial/discounts), if any?
4) What is the motion (self-serve, sales-led, hybrid) and typical contract sizes?
5) What is the primary objective and guardrails (e.g., conversion, ARPA, retention, churn, margin)?

## Context + goals
1) What is the **goal** of this pricing work (increase conversion, expansion, revenue, retention, repositioning, reduce support load)?
2) What are the **guardrails** (e.g., churn cannot increase, must keep free tier, margin floor, brand constraints)?
3) What is the **timeline** and decision forum (launch date, board meeting, quarterly planning)?

## Customer + value
4) Who is the **buyer** and who is the **user**? (titles/roles)
5) What are the top 1–3 **segments** you care about right now?
6) What outcomes do customers hire you for? What risks do you reduce?
7) What’s the switching cost / lock-in (data, workflow, team adoption)?

## Current pricing + packaging
8) What are the current plans, price points, and the **value metric** (seat, usage, projects, GB, etc.)?
9) Any existing discounts, annual pricing, or enterprise terms?
10) What is free vs paid today? Where is the paywall?
11) What features/usage limits are most correlated with customers getting value?

## Motion + operational constraints
12) Is this purely self-serve, sales-led, or hybrid? Any channel constraints?
13) Any hard limits for self-serve payments/processing (refunds, fraud, card limits), procurement, or invoicing requirements?
14) Any compliance/security requirements that force sales involvement (SOC2, HIPAA, SSO, data residency)?

## Evidence + research inputs
15) What do you know about willingness to pay today? Any customer quotes?
16) What metrics do you have (activation, conversion, ARPA, expansion, retention, churn, win/loss, support load)?
17) Any competitor/alternative references you want to consider (not required)?

## Output preferences
18) Do you want output as: in-chat pack, Markdown files, slide outline, or all of the above?
19) Who is the audience (founder, growth team, finance, sales, board)?
