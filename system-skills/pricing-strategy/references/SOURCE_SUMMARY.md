# Source Summary — pricing-strategy (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/pricing-strategy/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill covered
The source skill is a collection of tactical pricing insights from product leaders. It emphasizes pricing as a reflection of value and willingness to pay, and highlights common monetization mechanics and operational constraints.

## Top insights preserved and how they were transformed

1) **Price is a measure of value (WTP as proxy for desirability)**  
Preserved as: Step 4 (WTP plan) in `../SKILL.md` and checklist section **B** in [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md).

2) **Pricing is not “set and forget” (revisit every 6–12 months)**  
Preserved as: Step 6 (review cadence) in `../SKILL.md` and checklist section **G** in [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md).

3) **Self-serve monetization has practical ceilings (credit card limits, authority)**  
Preserved as: Step 3 (self-serve vs sales-led boundary) in `../SKILL.md` and checklist section **D** in [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md).

4) **Sampling premium features increases conversion (reverse trial / capped trial)**  
Preserved as: Step 5 (conversion mechanics) in `../SKILL.md` and checklist section **E** in [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md).

5) **Reducing early monetary friction can improve long-term success**  
Preserved as: Step 5 (friction reduction with guardrails + long-term metrics) in `../SKILL.md` and rubric category **5** in [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Notes on additions (manufactured execution layers)
The source skill is insight-heavy and light on executable process. This skill pack adds:
- An explicit input/output contract
- A 7-step workflow with checks
- Templates for a complete Pricing Strategy Pack
- Quality gates (checklists + rubric) and required final sections (risks/questions/next steps)
