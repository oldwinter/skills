# Founder Sales — Quality Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing the Founder Sales Sprint Pack.

## A) Scope + decision framing
- [ ] Goal is measurable and time-boxed (e.g., “10 customers in 8 weeks”)
- [ ] Stage is appropriate for founder-led sales (learning > scale)
- [ ] Constraints are captured (time/week, channels, compliance/brand)
- [ ] “Success in 30 days” is defined for the customer

## B) Founder POV (founder is the product)
- [ ] Founder POV leads with insight (not a feature list)
- [ ] Credibility is explicit (why the founder sees this pattern)
- [ ] Exclusion criteria exist (“not for…”) to keep the wedge sharp
- [ ] Proof points exist or a plan to generate them (pilots, quotes, results)

## C) Diagnostic discovery (shut the laptop)
- [ ] First call is designed to be diagnostic (no default demo)
- [ ] Question bank covers: workflow, pain, impact, trigger, decision process
- [ ] Call notes template captures verbatim customer language and quotes
- [ ] Every call ends with a concrete next step (not “let’s circle back”)

## D) Decision enablement (beat “no decision”)
- [ ] “Do nothing” is explicitly addressed and its cost is made concrete
- [ ] Decision guide includes options + criteria + recommendation
- [ ] Risk reversal/pilot plan is bounded (scope, timeline, success criteria)
- [ ] A mutual action plan (MAP) exists with dates, owners, and outputs

## E) Close-to-activation (white glove)
- [ ] Activation is defined (implemented + first value)
- [ ] Kickoff/implementation is scheduled as part of the close
- [ ] Owners are assigned on both sides
- [ ] Follow-up cadence is defined (first 4 weeks)
- [ ] “Closed” is not declared until activation criteria are met

## F) Learning loop + iteration
- [ ] Tracking exists (target list + statuses + next actions)
- [ ] Weekly review loop is defined (what will change next week)
- [ ] Assumptions & unknowns are listed with a validation plan
- [ ] Pack ends with Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## G) Safety + ethics
- [ ] No deceptive claims; no spam/automation guidance
- [ ] No requests for secrets (tokens/passwords/credentials)
- [ ] Customer data is handled minimally and shared only as needed
