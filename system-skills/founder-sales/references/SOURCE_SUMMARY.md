# Source Summary — founder-sales (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/founder-sales/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill covered
The source skill is a collection of tactical insights on **founder-led sales** (first customers, early sales). It emphasizes the founder’s role as the “product,” diagnostic selling, decision enablement (where “no decision” is a major competitor), and ensuring customers actually implement after saying yes.

## Top insights preserved and how they were transformed

1) **Founder-led sales works because the founder is the product (Jen Abel)**  
Preserved as: Step 2 (Founder POV + ICP wedge) in `../SKILL.md` and checklist **B** in [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md).

2) **“No decision” is often the main competitor (April Dunford)**  
Preserved as: Step 5 (Decision enablement kit) in `../SKILL.md` and checklist **D** + rubric category **5**.

3) **Early sales requires white-glove activation (“yes → silence” risk) (Dalton Caldwell)**  
Preserved as: Step 6 (Close-to-activation) in `../SKILL.md` and checklist **E** + rubric category **6**.

4) **Early discovery should be diagnostic—don’t default to demos (Geoffrey Moore)**  
Preserved as: Step 4 (Diagnostic discovery, no demo first) in `../SKILL.md` and checklist **C** + rubric category **4**.

5) **Founders cannot outsource early sales (Pete Kazanjy)**  
Preserved as: Step 1 (Stage gating + founder involvement) and “When NOT to use” boundaries in `../SKILL.md`.

## Notes on additions (manufactured execution layers)
The source skill is insight-heavy and light on executable process. This skill pack adds:
- A clear input/output contract
- A 7-step workflow with checks
- Copy/paste templates for outreach, discovery, decision enablement, and activation
- Quality gates (checklists + rubric) and required final sections (risks/questions/next steps)
