# Founder Sales — Workflow Notes

This file expands `../SKILL.md` with practical guidance, defaults, and talk tracks.

## Workflow at a glance (7 steps)
1) Intake + stage gating (founder-led focus)
2) Founder POV + ICP wedge
3) Targeting + outreach plan
4) Diagnostic discovery (no demo first)
5) Decision enablement (beat “no decision”)
6) Close-to-activation (white-glove implementation)
7) Quality gate + finalize (learning loop)

## Default assumptions (use only if missing)
- Timebox: **2–8 weeks** for an initial sprint; aim for **20–40** quality conversations.
- Prioritize **warm intros** first; use cold outreach for learning, not brute-force volume.
- First call is **diagnostic**: don’t demo until the buyer has articulated a problem and impact.
- Your primary competitor is often **status quo / “no decision”**. Make next steps safe and easy.
- A deal is not “won” until the customer is **activated** (implemented + first value).

## Guidance by step

### 1) Intake + stage gating
- Write down the **learning goal** (what must be true for this to work?) and the **business goal** (customers/revenue).
- Define “must-not-do” constraints (spam, deception, over-claiming, compliance violations).
- Ensure founder commitment: outbound and discovery are part of product discovery at this stage.

### 2) Founder POV + ICP wedge
- Lead with insight: “Here’s what’s changing / why the old way breaks / the cost of doing nothing.”
- Tighten to an ICP wedge you can *reach* and that can say “yes” quickly.
- Include exclusion criteria: “If you don’t have X, this probably isn’t for you.”

### 3) Targeting + outreach plan
- Build a list around observable signals:
  - role/title + company type
  - a trigger (new regulation, headcount change, tool migration, incident, growth)
  - a plausible pain signal (job posts, public complaints, tooling footprint)
- Prefer outreach that invites a **diagnostic conversation**, not a pitch.

### 4) Diagnostic discovery (no demo first)
- Start with context: “We’ve been talking to <peers> and we keep seeing <problem>. Is that true for you?”
- Ask for specifics and quantify impact (time, dollars, risk, missed goals).
- Use the call notes template to capture customer language verbatim.
- If the buyer asks for a demo early: offer a **very short** “guided tour” *after* you agree on what problem it would prove.

### 5) Decision enablement (beat “no decision”)
- Buyers avoid decisions when they fear making a visible mistake.
- Give a low-risk path:
  - a bounded pilot (scope, timeline, success criteria)
  - an evaluation checklist and a mutual action plan
  - explicit “next step menu” (do nothing / DIY / pilot) with tradeoffs
- Make “do nothing” concrete: what continues to break, what it costs, what risks accumulate.

### 6) Close-to-activation (white-glove implementation)
- Prevent the “yes → silence” failure mode by:
  - scheduling kickoff *during* the close
  - assigning a customer owner and internal owner
  - defining activation milestones and a weekly check-in cadence
- If implementation is the real friction, treat onboarding as part of sales: white-glove it.

### 7) Quality gate + finalize (learning loop)
- Define a simple weekly loop:
  - review calls and objections
  - update ICP wedge and messaging
  - iterate outreach and discovery questions
  - update decision/activation assets based on real stalls
- Always ship the pack with **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** so it’s usable immediately.
