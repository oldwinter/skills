# Founder Sales — Scoring Rubric (1–5)

Score each category from **1 (weak)** to **5 (excellent)**. A “ship-ready” pack is typically **4+** across categories, with no critical 1–2s.

## 1) ICP wedge clarity
**1:** ICP is vague; no exclusion criteria; unclear buyer vs user.  
**3:** ICP is defined; some clarity on buyer/user; partial exclusions.  
**5:** Sharp wedge with triggers, buyer/user roles, and explicit exclusions.

## 2) Founder POV strength (“founder is the product”)
**1:** Generic pitch; founder credibility absent; feature-led.  
**3:** Some insight narrative and proof points; still partly generic.  
**5:** Clear insight-led POV, credible founder angle, and proof points or plan to generate them.

## 3) Outreach kit quality
**1:** Spammy, high-volume, or generic messages; unclear ask.  
**3:** Reasonable sequence; some personalization hooks; CTA present.  
**5:** Ethical, targeted outreach with strong diagnostics, clear CTA, and specific personalization hypotheses.

## 4) Discovery quality (diagnostic-first)
**1:** Demo-driven; weak questions; no note structure.  
**3:** Mostly diagnostic; some impact quantification; notes template exists.  
**5:** Diagnostic script that reliably surfaces pain/impact/decision process and ends with a concrete next step.

## 5) Decision enablement (reducing “no decision”)
**1:** No assets; relies on persuasion; next steps are vague.  
**3:** Some decision guidance and pilot framing; MAP incomplete.  
**5:** Clear decision guide + bounded risk reversal + MAP with owners/dates that makes a decision easy and safe.

## 6) Activation plan (white-glove close-to-implementation)
**1:** “Closed won” ends at signature; no activation definition.  
**3:** Onboarding checklist exists; cadence partially defined.  
**5:** Activation criteria, kickoff scheduling, owner assignment, milestones, and follow-up cadence are all explicit.

## 7) Learning loop + completeness
**1:** No iteration plan; missing risks/questions/next steps.  
**3:** Some tracking and next steps; limited learning loop.  
**5:** Clear weekly loop with what changes, tracked hypotheses, and complete Risks/Open questions/Next steps.
