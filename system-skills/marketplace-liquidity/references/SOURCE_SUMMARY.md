# Source summary (what was preserved and how it was transformed)

This skill pack is based on the Refound/Lenny skill `sources/refound/raw/marketplace-liquidity/SKILL.md`, which contained four high-level insights about marketplace liquidity from four leaders.

## Preserved core insights → execution rules

### 1) Liquidity as efficient matching (Benjamin Lauzier)
- Preserved: liquidity is fundamentally about matching buyers and sellers efficiently; it is often fragmented.
- Converted into: a required **local market** definition, a **segment scorecard**, and a **fragmentation map** with market health metrics.

### 2) Liquidity as reliability (Dan Hockenmaier)
- Preserved: liquidity can be defined as “how reliably can users do the thing they came to do,” and it is a top marketplace metric.
- Converted into: a reliability-first **liquidity definition** with explicit thresholds (fill rate, time-to-match, quality guardrails) and a metric tree.

### 3) “Whac-a-mole” marketplace management (Ramesh Johari)
- Preserved: liquidity management often requires reallocating inventory/attention across segments.
- Converted into: a weekly **liquidity operating cadence** plus a **reallocation plan** and triggers.

### 4) Supply–demand flip-flop + graduation problem (Tim Holley)
- Preserved: marketplaces flip between supply- and demand-constrained states; sellers may “graduate” off the platform.
- Converted into: a per-segment **bottleneck diagnosis**, explicit “flip-flop” checks, and supplier churn/graduation checks in the workflow and checklists.

## What was added
- Concrete deliverables (templates, scorecards, backlog)
- Step-by-step workflow with checks
- Quality gate (checklists + rubric)
- Safety/robustness guidance (no secrets; segment-level assumptions flagged)
