# Rubric (score 0/1/2)

0 = missing / unusable  
1 = present but incomplete  
2 = clear, executable, reusable

Suggested passing bar: **>= 14/18**.

## 1) Reliability definition (0–2)
- 0: “Liquidity” is vague or purely conceptual
- 1: Defined but missing thresholds or user perspective
- 2: Clear reliability definition + thresholds (time + quality)

## 2) Local market segmentation (0–2)
- 0: Uses global averages only
- 1: Some segmentation but not tied to where matches occur
- 2: Local markets defined (geo/category/time) + priority segments selected

## 3) Metric tree quality (0–2)
- 0: No metric tree
- 1: Partial metrics list without definitions/guardrails
- 2: North-star + drivers + guardrails with definitions and segmentation

## 4) Fragmentation analysis (0–2)
- 0: No fragmentation concept
- 1: Mentions fragmentation without evidence
- 2: Identifies fragmented segments and how they affect reliability

## 5) Bottleneck diagnosis (0–2)
- 0: No diagnosis
- 1: Diagnosis exists but not segment-specific or evidence-backed
- 2: Per-segment diagnosis (supply/demand/mechanics/quality) with evidence + testable hypotheses

## 6) Interventions + experiments (0–2)
- 0: Generic tactics only
- 1: Experiments listed but missing hypotheses/metrics/timeboxes
- 2: Prioritized backlog with hypotheses, metrics, guardrails, and cycle time

## 7) Whac-a-mole operating plan (0–2)
- 0: No reallocation plan
- 1: Mentions reallocation without triggers/cadence
- 2: Weekly reallocation levers + triggers + decision log

## 8) Measurement + instrumentation (0–2)
- 0: No measurement plan
- 1: Metrics listed without data sources/event defs
- 2: Dashboards/alerts + event/table mapping + instrumentation gaps

## 9) Risks/open questions/next steps (0–2)
- 0: Missing
- 1: Present but generic
- 2: Specific risks (incl. second-order effects), concrete open questions, and an unblocked 2-week plan
