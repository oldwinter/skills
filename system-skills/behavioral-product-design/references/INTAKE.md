# Intake (copy/paste questions)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**, then proceed with assumptions if answers aren’t available.

## A) Context
1) What is the product and primary user segment (who is this for)?
2) What is the user’s job-to-be-done in this flow (what outcome do they want)?
3) What constraints matter (platform, notification channels, brand tone, legal/compliance)?

## B) Target behavior + success
4) What is the **one primary target behavior**? (action + context + frequency)
5) What metric should move if we succeed (activation rate, D7 retention, completion %, conversion)?
6) What are guardrails (complaints, opt-outs, churn, refunds, time spent, support tickets)?

## C) Current baseline + evidence
7) Where is the drop-off today (step/state) and what’s the baseline rate?
8) What evidence do we have (user quotes, research, tickets, analytics, session replays)?
9) What attempts have already been tried (and what happened)?

## D) Build + experiment reality
10) What can we ship in 1–2 sprints (engineering/design capacity)?
11) Can we A/B test? If not, what’s the best feasible evaluation method (phased rollout, holdout, pre/post)?
12) What events/metrics are already instrumented (and what’s missing)?

## E) Ethics + trust
13) What user benefit are we optimizing for (not just the business metric)?
14) Are there sensitive cohorts (minors, vulnerable users) or regulated contexts?
15) What must be transparent and easy to control (notifications, defaults, cancellation)?
