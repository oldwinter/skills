# Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing the Behavioral Product Design Pack.

## 1) Target behavior checklist
- [ ] Target user segment is explicit.
- [ ] Primary target behavior is observable (action + context + frequency).
- [ ] Success metric and baseline are stated (even if approximate).
- [ ] Guardrail metrics are defined (trust, opt-outs, complaints, churn, etc.).
- [ ] User benefit is stated (not only the business outcome).

## 2) Diagnosis checklist
- [ ] Top drop-off moments are tied to specific journey steps/states.
- [ ] For each moment, the likely barrier type is named (motivation/ability/prompt/uncertainty).
- [ ] Mechanism hypotheses are plausible and labeled when speculative.
- [ ] At least one piece of evidence (data/quote/research) is linked per priority moment, or it’s called out as missing.

## 3) Intervention quality checklist
- [ ] Each intervention maps to a specific barrier and mechanism.
- [ ] At least one intervention reduces friction (ability) and one reduces uncertainty (trust).
- [ ] “Pause moments” are meaningful, skippable, and not spammy.
- [ ] “Bend not break” policy is explicit (grace/freeze/recovery/flexible goals), if using streaks/habits.
- [ ] Interventions include user controls (settings/opt-out) where relevant.

## 4) Ethics / trust checklist (required)
- [ ] No deception: no hidden costs, forced continuity, or misleading UI.
- [ ] No coercion: user can opt out without penalty.
- [ ] No exploitation of vulnerable cohorts; extra safeguards if sensitive contexts.
- [ ] Framing respects autonomy (help users achieve their goals).
- [ ] Risks and potential harms are listed with mitigations.

## 5) Experiment readiness checklist
- [ ] Each top bet has a clear hypothesis and a measurable metric movement.
- [ ] Instrumentation requirements are listed (events/properties).
- [ ] Rollout plan is safe (flags/phased) with stop-the-line triggers.
- [ ] Decision rule is stated (ship/iterate/kill).
