# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands `../SKILL.md` with practical behavioral design heuristics and a lightweight mechanism → pattern library.

## Principles (from the source skill)
- **Use real behavioral mechanisms, not vibes**: start from a barrier/driver and choose a mechanism intentionally.
- **Loss aversion can strengthen retention once progress feels owned**: progress/streaks can become something users don’t want to lose—use this ethically.
- **“Bend, not break”**: habit systems work better when they tolerate real life (grace periods, recovery).
- **Create “pause moments” for celebration**: meaningful reinforcement beats constant tiny rewards.

## Quick mechanism → pattern library

Use these as idea triggers. Always add: user benefit, transparency, and opt-out.

### Present bias (people overweight “now” vs “later”)
Patterns:
- Reduce time-to-value (instant win before long setup)
- “Start small” defaults (first action <60 seconds)
- Immediate feedback (progress bar, confirmation, next-best action)

### Status quo effect (people stick with what they have)
Patterns:
- Safe defaults (pre-selected best option, reversible)
- Migration helpers (import, concierge setup, “done-for-you”)
- “Try without switching” modes (preview, sandbox, temporary link)

### Uncertainty aversion (fear of the unknown)
Patterns:
- Show what will happen next (steps, time estimates, examples)
- Reduce perceived risk (undo, trial, clear guarantees, privacy explanations)
- Social proof that matches the user (peer examples, “people like you”)

### Loss aversion / progress ownership
Patterns:
- Progress framing (“don’t lose your streak/progress”), paired with benevolence
- “Bend not break” protection (grace days, streak freeze, recovery path)
- Milestone celebrations (“pause moments”) at meaningful thresholds

### Friction / ability constraints
Patterns:
- Remove steps, reduce typing, smart defaults
- Save state + resume later
- Error prevention and clearer affordances (labels, examples)

### Forgetting / lack of prompts
Patterns:
- Contextual reminders (event-triggered vs spam)
- User-controlled notification schedules
- In-product triggers (checklists, nudges) before external channels

## How to design ethical “pause moments”
Rules of thumb:
- Celebrate **meaningful progress** (first success, weekly streak, completed setup), not every click.
- Make it skippable and non-blocking; avoid hijacking the flow.
- Use reinforcement to point to the *user outcome* (“You’re ready to ___”), not just “Congrats”.

## “Bend not break” options (habit resilience)
Choose one and define it explicitly:
- **Grace period:** miss 1 day without breaking.
- **Streak freeze:** user earns/chooses limited freezes.
- **Recovery path:** streak breaks but user keeps a “best streak” and has a clear way back.
- **Flexible goals:** “4 days/week” instead of daily, if daily is unrealistic.
