# Examples

**Example 1 (shared capabilities):** “Use `platform-infrastructure` for a B2B analytics app where every team keeps rebuilding export, filtering, and permissions. Output a platformization plan + roadmap + SLO targets.”

**Example 2 (scaling readiness):** “We expect 5× traffic in 6 months. Define a doomsday clock for Postgres limits, propose scaling projects, and set reliability/performance SLOs. Also standardize server-side analytics.”

**Boundary example:** “We’re mid-incident and pages are down—tell us what to do right now.”  
Response: out of scope; recommend incident response first, then use this skill post-incident to create the scaling plan and reliability roadmap.
