# Checklists (Technical Roadmaps)

Use these before finalizing the pack.

## Strategy (Rumelt) checklist
- [ ] Diagnosis is specific (not generic) and backed by evidence (metrics/incidents/examples).
- [ ] Guiding policy is 3–5 crisp principles that constrain choices.
- [ ] Coherent actions clearly derive from Diagnosis + Guiding policy.
- [ ] Trade-offs/non-goals are explicit (what we will *not* do).
- [ ] Assumptions and uncertainties are called out with decision gates (RFC/spike).

## Roadmap checklist
- [ ] Roadmap items are outcome-oriented (not “do work”).
- [ ] Owners are named (team/role is acceptable if names aren’t known).
- [ ] Dependencies are explicit and sequenced (unlock order is clear).
- [ ] Milestones exist for near-term items; longer-horizon items have themes + major milestones.
- [ ] Confidence is stated for each major item (high/med/low).
- [ ] Success metrics exist (baseline → target where possible).

## Alignment + governance checklist
- [ ] Audience and decision are explicit (what approval is needed).
- [ ] Update cadence is defined (monthly/quarterly refresh) and realistic.
- [ ] Change-control rules exist (“trade, don’t add” if capacity is fixed).
- [ ] Comms template exists and uses consistent language.

## Final pack checklist
- [ ] Includes: Dependency + risk register.
- [ ] Includes: Risks / Open questions / Next steps.
- [ ] Uses templates consistently (no missing sections).
- [ ] Written so stakeholders can critique it async (debuggable).
