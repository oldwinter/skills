# Intake questions (Technical Roadmaps)

Ask up to 5 at a time. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and record them under **Open questions**.

## Fast minimum (answer these first)
1) What’s the **audience** and what **decision** must this roadmap enable (funding, sequencing, headcount, trade-offs)?
2) What’s the **time horizon** (e.g., 2 quarters / 12 months) and preferred format (quarters vs Now/Next/Later)?
3) What are the top 3 **pain signals** today (incidents, latency, cost, dev velocity, quality, compliance)?
4) What are the **constraints** (capacity, deadlines, compliance/security, platform constraints, non-negotiables)?
5) What are the **candidate initiatives** (paste a list) and any known **dependencies**?

## Context + strategy
- What’s the product/company strategy that constrains technical choices (e.g., “enterprise readiness”, “international expansion”)?
- What’s explicitly **in scope** vs **out of scope**?
- What trade-off are we willing to make (speed vs cost vs reliability vs platform evolution)?

## Current-state diagnosis
- Architecture snapshot (high level): key systems, hotspots, known bottlenecks.
- Operational reality: on-call load, incident themes, SLO/SLA gaps, security findings.
- Delivery reality: cycle time, PR throughput, flaky tests, build times, deployment frequency.

## Execution constraints
- Team shape and ownership boundaries (who owns what today)?
- Any fixed dates/windows (launches, migrations, contract renewals)?
- External dependencies (vendors, other teams, data availability)?

## Output preferences
- Preferred roadmap style: Now/Next/Later, quarters, or “themes + milestones”.
- Do you want initiative briefs for the top 3, top 5, or top 6?
- Any required headings/format for leadership (doc style, 1-pager, deck outline)?
