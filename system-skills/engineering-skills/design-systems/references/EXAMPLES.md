# Examples (2 good, 1 boundary)

## Example 1 — Create a design system plan from scratch (web)
**Prompt**
“Use `design-systems`. Context: B2B SaaS web app. Current state: inconsistent UI, lots of one-off CSS, no shared tokens, and slow design→dev handoff. Goal: improve consistency and speed; first impact in 6 weeks. Constraints: accessibility required; small team (2 designers, 6 engineers). Output: a Design System Operating Pack.”

**What “good” looks like**
- Clear charter with a narrow first slice (e.g., forms + tables + page layout recipe).
- Token taxonomy includes semantic color + spacing + elevation + focus/motion rules.
- Roadmap has milestone acceptance criteria and a lightweight governance workflow.

## Example 2 — Evolve an existing system for more depth/texture
**Prompt**
“Use `design-systems`. We already have tokens and components, but the UI feels too flat. We want more depth (surfaces/elevation) and richer motion without breaking existing screens. Output: update plan including token additions, component impact assessment, rollout/migration plan, and adoption strategy.”

**What “good” looks like**
- Proposed elevation/surface/motion tokens with usage rules and reduced-motion guidance.
- Component impact list prioritized by risk (modals/menus/cards first).
- Rollout plan with a safe migration path and clear quality gates.

## Boundary example — Brand/logo request
**Prompt**
“Pick a logo style and color palette for my new company.”

**Recommended response**
- Explain this skill is for operational UI design systems (tokens/components/governance), not logo/brand identity design.
- Offer to help define brand inputs needed (or suggest using a brand/identity-focused process) and ask what UI surfaces they need standardized if they want to proceed with a design system.
