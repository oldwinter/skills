# Intake — Finding Mentors & Sponsors

Use this to ask the minimum questions needed to produce the Mentor & Sponsor Plan Pack. Ask **3–5 at a time**, then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Quick-start (answer these 5)
1) What’s your current role/level, function, and domain (industry/product type)?
2) What outcome do you want in the next 3–6 months (be specific)?
3) What are your top 2–4 gaps/problems you want help with (examples welcome)?
4) Are you primarily seeking: mentor (advice), sponsor (advocacy), coach (skills/practice), or a mix?
5) What constraints do you have (time/week, confidentiality, internal vs external, preferred channels)?

## Targeting + network context
6) Do you want mentors/sponsors **inside your company**, **outside**, or both?
7) List 5–15 starting points (names or anonymized roles) across: manager chain, adjacent teams, past colleagues, communities, alumni networks.
8) Any “must haves” (domain, seniority, identity/values alignment) or “must avoid”?
9) What is your comfort level with outreach (1–10)? What feels awkward about it?

## Sponsorship-specific
10) What rooms/decisions do you need influence in (projects, staffing, promotions, scope decisions)?
11) What “bet-worthy” outcomes can you deliver in the next 4–12 weeks to earn advocacy?

## Coaching-specific (optional)
12) Are you considering hiring a coach? If yes: budget range, frequency, focus areas, and any deal-breakers.

## Safety / confidentiality
- Don’t share confidential company information, private HR details, or sensitive personal data.
- If you can’t share names, use placeholders like “Staff Eng Manager on Platform” — we can still build targeting and scripts.
