## Preserved insights → rules

1) **Humility wins mentors (Chip Conley)**  
   - *Insight:* Admitting what you don’t know is attractive to true mentors.  
   - *Rule in this pack:* Outreach should include a specific learning gap and a small, respectful ask.

2) **Sponsors accelerate careers (Christopher Miller)**  
   - *Insight:* Sponsors/advocates spend professional capital to bet on you; they’re distinct from mentors.  
   - *Rule in this pack:* Build an explicit sponsor strategy (earn → signal → ask) with concrete sponsor actions.

3) **Your problems aren’t unique (Elena Verna)**  
   - *Insight:* Many “new” problems have been solved; learn from those who have done it before.  
   - *Rule in this pack:* Target people who have faced the same class of problem; ask for patterns and pitfalls.

4) **Interview multiple coaches (Ada Chen Rekhi)**  
   - *Insight:* Coach effectiveness depends heavily on fit; don’t choose the first one.  
   - *Rule in this pack:* Use a coach scorecard and talk to 2–3 candidates.

5) **Mentorship can be a portfolio (Ami Vora)**  
   - *Insight:* You can learn from many leaders without a single formal mentor relationship.  
   - *Rule in this pack:* Build a mentor portfolio map and treat mentorship as a system.
