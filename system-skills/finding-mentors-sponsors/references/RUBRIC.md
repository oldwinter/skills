# Rubric — Finding Mentors & Sponsors

Score each dimension 1–5. Aim for **≥ 24/35** before finalizing.

## 1) Goal clarity (1–5)
1: Vague (“grow my career”).  
3: Clear outcomes but missing timeline or context.  
5: Specific, time-bounded outcomes with constraints and success criteria.

## 2) Mentor vs sponsor differentiation (1–5)
1: Treats them as the same thing.  
3: Definitions exist but plan doesn’t change based on type.  
5: Clear distinctions; separate tactics and deliverables for each.

## 3) Targeting quality (1–5)
1: Random list, no fit rationale.  
3: Some fit rationale; weak prioritization.  
5: High-fit, diversified list with strong prioritization and profiles.

## 4) Warm-path realism (1–5)
1: Mostly cold outreach with no angle.  
3: Some warm paths identified.  
5: Strong warm paths for top targets; clear first steps.

## 5) Outreach quality (1–5)
1: Generic, long, or guilt-inducing.  
3: Decent scripts but not personalized or not “easy yes/no”.  
5: Personalized, humble, specific, short; includes follow-ups and intro ask.

## 6) Operating system quality (1–5)
1: One-off conversations only.  
3: Cadence exists but tracking/value exchange is thin.  
5: Sustainable cadence + tracking + clear value exchange.

## 7) Sponsorship activation (1–5)
1: “Please sponsor me” with no plan.  
3: Some actions, but asks are vague or untimely.  
5: Clear earn/signal/ask path with concrete sponsor actions and timing.

## Interpreting the score
- **30–35:** Ready to execute immediately.
- **24–29:** Solid; tighten the weakest 1–2 areas.
- **< 24:** Rework targeting, outreach specificity, and/or sponsor activation plan.
