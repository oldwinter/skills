# Expanded Workflow — Finding Mentors & Sponsors

This file expands the 8-step workflow in `../SKILL.md` with rules, checks, and practical guidance.

## Key definitions (use consistently)
- **Mentor:** gives advice, perspective, and pattern-matching; they don’t owe you opportunities.
- **Sponsor:** advocates for you and spends *political capital* (introductions, staffing, promotion support).
- **Coach:** helps you practice and improve a specific skill through feedback and repetition.

## Core rules (converted from the source skill)
1) **Lead with humility and specificity.**  
   - *Rule:* Admit what you don’t know and ask about a concrete gap.  
   - *Check:* Your outreach includes a specific “I’m learning X / struggling with Y” and a small ask.

2) **Optimize for sponsors, not just mentors.**  
   - *Rule:* Treat sponsorship as a distinct goal; plan for earning trust and asking for specific bets.  
   - *Check:* Your plan includes sponsor candidates + an “earn → signal → ask” path.

3) **Assume your problems aren’t unique.**  
   - *Rule:* Find people who have solved the thing you’re facing; shortcut by pattern matching.  
   - *Check:* Each ask ties to a problem the person has likely seen before.

4) **If hiring a coach, interview multiple for fit.**  
   - *Rule:* Don’t pick the first coach; evaluate vibe + outcomes + methods.  
   - *Check:* You have a scorecard and spoke to 2–3 candidates.

5) **Build a portfolio, not a single “perfect mentor.”**  
   - *Rule:* Collect different leaders’ strengths (emulate specific behaviors).  
   - *Check:* Your mentor map has multiple categories (skill, domain, org navigation, leadership).

## Practical guidance by step

### Step 1 — Intake + goal clarity
- Prefer goals that are **observable** (e.g., “staffed onto X”, “led Y scope”, “improved Z skill with feedback loop”).
- Write 2 versions of the goal:
  - **Private:** full detail for you
  - **Shareable:** safe to share in outreach (no secrets)

### Step 2 — Help map (mentor portfolio)
Recommended mentor portfolio categories:
- Role model (career path + values)
- Skill coach (e.g., executive communication, management, storytelling)
- Domain expert (e.g., pricing, growth, enterprise, infra)
- Org navigator (internal: how decisions really get made)
- Peer council (same level; real-time problem solving)

### Step 3 — Target list + warm paths
Targeting heuristics:
- **High-fit:** they’ve done the thing you’re trying to do in a similar context
- **Reachable:** you have a plausible warm path or a credible shared context
- **Likely to help:** signal generosity (teaching, writing, community participation)

Warm path ideas:
- Mutual connections: ask for a warm intro with a tight, low-friction blurb
- Communities: alumni groups, professional slacks, meetups, conferences, internal ERGs
- Shared artifacts: “I read your post/talk; question about X”

### Step 4 — Outreach scripts
Message must include:
- Context: why them (1 sentence)
- Specific gap/problem (1 sentence)
- Small ask (15–30 min)
- Easy out (“no worries if now isn’t a good time”)

### Step 5 — First conversations
30-minute structure:
- 2 min: context + goal
- 20 min: questions and discussion
- 5 min: advice summary + “what would you do next?”
- 3 min: close + permission to follow up + next step

### Step 6 — Relationship OS
Cadence options:
- Mentor: 30 minutes monthly or quarterly
- Coach: weekly/biweekly (more structured)
- Sponsor: async updates + strategic asks when the timing is right

Value exchange examples:
- Do the prep work (send a 1-pager; bring options)
- Close the loop (“here’s what I tried; here’s what happened”)
- Offer help (research, summaries, intros where appropriate)

### Step 7 — Sponsorship
Earning trust:
- Deliver reliable outcomes on visible work
- Be coachable (take feedback; show iteration)
- Reduce risk for the sponsor (clarify the ask; do the logistics)

Concrete sponsor asks (examples):
- “Could you introduce me to X because I’m trying to learn Y?”
- “If you think it’s appropriate, could you staff me onto project Z?”
- “Would you be willing to vouch for my impact in the next promotion cycle?”
- “Could you say my name for role/scope A when it comes up?”

### Step 8 — Quality gate
Aim for:
- A plan you can execute **this week** (first 3 outreaches, first 1–2 meetings scheduled)
- A system that’s sustainable (not a one-time burst)
