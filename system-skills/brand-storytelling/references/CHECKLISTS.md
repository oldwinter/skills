# Checklists

Use these to validate the Brand Storytelling Pack before finalizing.

## A) Truth + safety checklist (required)
- [ ] No invented facts, metrics, customer names, or fabricated “dramatic” events
- [ ] Claims have proof, or are labeled “to validate”
- [ ] No confidential/security-sensitive information is included
- [ ] Regulated/high-risk claims are avoided (or flagged for expert review)

## B) Audience + goal clarity checklist
- [ ] Primary audience is explicit (customers vs investors vs press)
- [ ] Primary channel(s) are named and reflected in the scripts
- [ ] Success definition is stated (belief/behavior change)
- [ ] CTA is explicit and appropriate for the audience/stage

## C) Brand perception alignment checklist
- [ ] Purpose, positioning, and personality are stated
- [ ] The story reinforces the target perception (not a random vibe)
- [ ] “Say/do” alignment is credible (you can back it up with behavior or proof)

## D) “Five-second moment” checklist
- [ ] The story contains a singular moment of realization/transformation
- [ ] The moment is specific (time/place/event/trigger), not abstract
- [ ] Most of the story builds context to make the moment land
- [ ] The before/after belief or behavior change is clear

## E) Narrative quality checklist (no fluff)
- [ ] Each beat has a job (context, tension, moment, proof, invitation)
- [ ] Concrete nouns/verbs; minimal jargon; no hype adjectives doing the work
- [ ] The story is memorable in one retell (core message fits in one sentence)

## F) Channel usability checklist
- [ ] 2-minute script is sayable and paced
- [ ] 30-second script works as a standalone summary
- [ ] Website paragraph is skimmable and specific
- [ ] Tone matches brand personality and constraints

## G) Proof + identity checklist (ethical)
- [ ] Proof bank maps to key claims
- [ ] Identity hooks (if used) are honest and non-manipulative
- [ ] Tradeoffs / “not for” are stated when helpful

## H) Build-in-public checklist (if included)
- [ ] Cadence is realistic and owners are named
- [ ] Content pillars are specific (show work, learnings, decisions)
- [ ] Guardrails are stated (confidentiality, claims, tone)
- [ ] Metrics/success signals are lightweight and measurable

## I) Finalization checklist
- [ ] Includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**
- [ ] Assumptions/TBDs are labeled
- [ ] Output is usable as-is with minimal editing
