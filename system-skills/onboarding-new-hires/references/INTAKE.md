# Intake Questions (pick 3–5 at a time)

## 1) The hire + role
1) What role + level is this hire, and what does “crushing it” look like in 90 days?
2) Is this an IC, manager, or functional leader? Any leadership scope (direct reports, budget, ownership)?
3) What must this person deliver at **30/60/90 days**, and at **1 year / 2 years**?
4) What are the top 2–3 “tricky parts” of the role (ambiguity, politics, domain complexity, pace)?

## 2) Team + environment
5) What’s the team’s mission, current priorities, and what’s hard right now?
6) What stage is the company/team in (0→1, scale-up, turnaround)? What constraints exist (time, headcount, tech debt)?
7) Remote/hybrid/in-office? Any time zones, travel, or async constraints?

## 3) Stakeholders + relationships
8) Who are the key stakeholders this hire must build trust with (names/titles optional)?
9) Any known tensions, sensitivities, or “don’t step on landmines” areas?
10) Who will be the hire’s buddy/first-pair, and what should that person be responsible for?

## 4) Existing onboarding assets
11) What docs already exist (team docs, strategy doc, onboarding guide, org chart, metrics dashboards)?
12) What “hidden curriculum” do new hires struggle with (acronyms, how decisions get made, where truth lives)?

## 5) Constraints + preferences
13) Any confidentiality/PII constraints (what can be in a shareable doc)?
14) Timeline urgency: should the plan bias toward speed or caution (“listen longer”)?
15) Output preference: calendar-ready schedule, or higher-level plan with templates?
