# Examples

**Example 1 (manager onboarding plan):** “We’re onboarding a Senior PM starting Feb 5. Create a full onboarding pack: preboarding, first-week plan, listening tour schedule, working agreement prompts, and a 30/60/90 + 1y/2y success plan. We’re remote across PST/EST.”  
Expected: a complete pack with calendar-ready steps and role-specific success definitions.

**Example 2 (new leader joining):** “A new Engineering Manager is joining a team with morale issues. Build a 0–30 listening tour kit and a 30-day state-of-the-union memo outline, plus a cautious 30/60/90 plan that prioritizes trust.”  
Expected: stakeholder map + question guide, synthesis template, and guarded plan that avoids premature changes.

**Boundary example:** “Write a generic onboarding checklist for all roles.”  
Response: ask for role + context; propose a minimal universal skeleton and require role-specific tailoring before finalizing.
