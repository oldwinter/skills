# EXAMPLES (Meeting Packs)

These are longer examples than the ones in `../SKILL.md`. Copy/paste and adapt.

## Positive example 1 — Weekly Operational Meeting (60 min)

**Objective:** Keep priority projects on track, surface blockers, and assign owners — without drifting into strategy.

**Outputs**
- Updated action items table (owners + due dates)
- Blockers list with escalation owners
- Parking lot topics moved to a separate forum

**Agenda (high-level)**
- 0–5: Priming (objective, rules, roles)
- 5–35: Timeboxed project check-ins (strict)
- 35–50: Blockers + decisions
- 50–60: Close-out questions + next week hygiene

## Positive example 2 — Decision Meeting (Onboarding A vs B)

**Objective:** Decide which onboarding flow to ship for the next experiment cycle.

**Decision owner:** Head of Product

**Pre-read highlights**
- Evidence: activation %, time-to-value, support tickets
- Options: A vs B with pros/cons and what would change our minds

**Outputs**
- Decision record + rationale
- Implementation plan owners
- Stakeholders to inform (Sales, Support)

## Negative example — Status-in-disguise “alignment” meeting

Signals:
- No decision owner
- No pre-read
- 8–12 attendees “just in case”
- Agenda is “updates” + “discussion”

Fix:
- Convert to async status update + 30-min discussion-only meeting for the one real decision.
