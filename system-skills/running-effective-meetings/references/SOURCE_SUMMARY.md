# SOURCE SUMMARY (What was preserved and how it was transformed)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/running-effective-meetings/SKILL.md` (Category: Communication)

This skill pack converts the original “insights” into an execution contract: rules, checks, and concrete artifacts (Meeting Pack).

## Distilled rules → checks → artifacts

### Naomi Gleit — Separate strategic vs operational meetings
- **Rule:** Don’t mix strategic discussion and operational updates in the same recurring meeting.
- **Check:** Does the meeting format match its purpose (structured ops vs open strategic)?
- **Artifact:** Meeting brief template + meeting format chooser in `references/WORKFLOW.md`.

### Annie Duke — Meetings are for discussion (not discovery)
- **Rule:** Live meetings should be for **discussion**; discovery happens async; decisions are recorded explicitly.
- **Check:** Can attendees arrive ready to discuss without live reading?
- **Artifact:** Pre-read template + Discover/Discuss/Decide guidance in `references/WORKFLOW.md`.

### Alisa Cohn — Close with three questions
- **Rule:** End every meeting by capturing decisions, actions, and comms.
- **Check:** Are “decide / do / who-else-needs-to-know” answered in writing?
- **Artifact:** Close-out checklist + follow-up template in `references/CHECKLISTS.md` and `references/TEMPLATES.md`.

### Evan LaPointe — Prime before deciding
- **Rule:** Every meeting needs a priming phase (objective, mode, decision rights) before discussion.
- **Check:** Do participants understand why they’re here and what must be produced?
- **Artifact:** Priming script and roles in `references/TEMPLATES.md`.

### Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky — Use scripted workshops when needed
- **Rule:** For complex problems, use a scripted workshop approach rather than endless unstructured meetings.
- **Check:** Is the problem better served by a workshop format (structured exercises + outputs)?
- **Artifact:** Workshop meeting type guidance in `references/WORKFLOW.md`.

## What was added (to make it executable)
- A clear input/output contract (minimum inputs + Meeting Pack deliverables)
- A 7-step workflow (meeting-needed decision → pre-read → agenda → facilitation → capture → follow-up)
- Copy/paste templates, checklists, and a scoring rubric
