# CHECKLISTS

## A) “Is a meeting needed?” checklist
- [ ] The goal requires real-time **discussion** (not just status or broadcasting).
- [ ] The decision owner (or delegated authority) will attend.
- [ ] There is a draft pre-read or shared context (no cold starts).
- [ ] The meeting has a single primary output (decision / plan / commitments).
- [ ] Attendees are the minimum set needed to discuss and act.

## B) Pre-meeting checklist (setup + priming)
- [ ] Meeting brief completed (objective, type, outputs, roles).
- [ ] Pre-read sent with enough time (ideally 24–48h).
- [ ] Agenda is timed; 1–3 topics max.
- [ ] Roles assigned: facilitator, decision owner, note-taker, timekeeper.
- [ ] “Deep dive off-ramp” defined (parking lot + follow-up plan).

## C) In-meeting facilitation checklist
- [ ] Start with priming (objective, mode, decision rights, ground rules).
- [ ] Keep discussion anchored to the decision/output.
- [ ] Capture decisions/actions live in the notes template.
- [ ] Use timeboxes; call out when a topic is drifting.
- [ ] If conflict stalls progress, summarize trade-offs and ask decision owner to choose a path.

## D) Close-out checklist (prevent re-meetings)
- [ ] What did we decide? (written)
- [ ] Who does what by when? (owners + due dates)
- [ ] Who else needs to know? (named + assigned)
- [ ] Any open questions are recorded with an owner and a plan to resolve.

## E) Post-meeting checklist (follow-through)
- [ ] Follow-up message sent within 24h.
- [ ] Decisions recorded in a decision log (with rationale).
- [ ] Action items entered into the team’s tracker (or at least a table).
- [ ] Hygiene call: keep/kill/shorten/split recurring meetings that drift.
