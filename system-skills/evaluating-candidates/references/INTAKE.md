# Intake Questions (pick 3–5 at a time)

## 1) Role + context
1) What role + level are you hiring for, and what does “success in 6 months” look like?
2) What’s the company stage and operating environment (pace, ambiguity, constraints)?
3) What are the top 2–3 outcomes this person must deliver?
4) What are non-negotiables (skills/behaviors) and explicit red flags?

## 2) Your bar + calibration
5) What’s your hiring bar: “raise the bar”, “meet the bar”, or “urgent fill” (and why)?
6) Do you have benchmark examples of “great” people in this role (internally or from the market)?
7) Which do you value more for this role: raw ability + drive or specific domain experience?

## 3) Candidate(s) + current signals
8) Are we evaluating one candidate or a slate? Who are the finalists?
9) What inputs do you have: resume, portfolio, interview notes/scorecards, work sample results, references?
10) Any known concerns (gaps, short tenures, conflicts, defensiveness, values mismatch)?

## 4) Process constraints + fairness
11) What’s the timeline and decision-maker set (who decides, by when)?
12) Any constraints on work samples (time limits, paid vs unpaid, IP/confidentiality)?
13) Any privacy/PII constraints (what can be included in a shareable doc)?
14) Any fairness/bias considerations to pay attention to (non-traditional background, career breaks, etc.)?

## 5) Output preferences
15) Should outputs be internal-only or shareable with a broader group?
16) Do you want a conservative recommendation (“hire only if clear”) or a risk-balanced one (“hire with mitigations”)?
