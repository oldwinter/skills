# Checklists (quality gates)

## A) Bar + criteria checklist
- Criteria list is 4–8 items and written as observable behaviors/outcomes
- Each criterion has rating anchors (strong/acceptable/weak) and evidence hints
- Red flags are explicit (not “vibes”)
- “Culture” is defined as behaviors/values, not similarity
- Interview/work sample/reference signals are mapped to criteria (no double counting)

## B) Work sample / trial checklist
- Task is job-relevant and representative of real work
- Scope/timebox is explicit and reasonable
- Rubric exists with anchors; evaluators know what “good” looks like
- Candidate is not asked to do unpaid speculative production work
- Scenario is sanitized; no proprietary data collection
- Instructions are clear enough to avoid “test-taking skill” bias

## C) Reference check checklist
- References chosen for proximity and duration (manager/peer/partner, not just friends)
- Questions demand specific examples and calibration against peers
- Notes capture evidence, not just adjectives (“great”, “smart”)
- Conflicts/limitations/bias are acknowledged (inflation, grudges, outdated context)
- Summary produces a clear signal (rehire? in what context?)

## D) Decision memo checklist
- Recommendation matches the weighted evidence across criteria
- Disconfirming evidence is included (not cherry-picked)
- Unknowns are explicit and tied to next steps (if “hold”)
- Risks have mitigations (if “hire”)
- Output respects privacy/PII constraints (no sensitive data beyond what’s allowed)

## E) Fairness + robustness checklist
- Evidence is tied to criteria, not delivery style or confidence
- One strong signal does not erase multiple weak signals (halo effect check)
- Differences in background are handled explicitly (non-traditional path, career breaks)
- You can explain the decision in one paragraph using evidence (not gut feel)
