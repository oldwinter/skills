# Examples

**Example 1 (final decision):** “Here are interview notes for a Senior PM candidate. Create a scorecard, summarize signals, and write a hiring decision memo. Include risks and suggested mitigations.”  
Expected: scorecard with anchors + evidence, signal log, decision memo with explicit risks.

**Example 2 (work sample + references):** “We’re hiring a Founding Engineer. Design a 2-day paid trial task and rubric, plus a reference check script. Then show how we should combine those signals into a hire/no-hire decision.”  
Expected: trial brief + rubric, reference kit, and a synthesis framework.

**Boundary example:** “Tell me if this person is good. I only have their resume.”  
Response: require criteria + at least one high-signal input (structured interview notes, work sample plan/results, or references); propose a minimal evaluation plan and list assumptions/unknowns.
