# Running Offsites — Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing the Offsite Pack.

## 1) Offsite Brief checklist

- Purpose is a single sentence and includes “why now”.
- Target outputs are 3–7 artifacts (not “feel aligned”).
- Decisions in scope are explicit; out-of-scope items are named.
- Participants list includes decision makers needed for commitments.
- Success measures include “immediately after” and “2–4 weeks after”.
- Risks include team dynamics and missing inputs/data.

## 2) Agenda checklist

- Every session has an output artifact (decision/principles/plan/agreements).
- At least 60% of time is interactive/co-creation.
- “Laptops down” blocks are explicit (scribe exception defined).
- Breaks are scheduled (10 min every 60–90 min; longer break mid-day).
- The day starts with connection and ends with follow-through.

## 3) Prework checklist

- Prework reduces context-setting time during the offsite.
- Prompts are specific and require participants to think/do work.
- Assignments have owners and due dates.
- Sensitive topics are handled safely (no forced disclosure).

## 4) Facilitation checklist

- Opening script names purpose, outputs, and norms.
- Decision capture fields are defined (statement, rationale, owner, review).
- Disagreement handling plan exists (criteria/principles, timebox, escalation).
- Parking lot mechanism exists with owner assignment during close.

## 5) Logistics checklist

- Room setup supports whiteboards and breakouts.
- Supplies are explicitly listed (markers, stickies, adapters).
- Accessibility needs are accounted for.
- Contingency plan exists (venue/tech/participant issues).

## 6) Post-offsite follow-through checklist (“no Monday amnesia”)

- Decisions log is complete and has owners + next steps.
- Action plan has due dates and dependencies.
- Follow-up comms draft is ready for stakeholders not in the room.
- A checkpoint date is scheduled (2–3 weeks) with a review purpose.
- A memory artifact is defined and publishable within 24–48 hours.
