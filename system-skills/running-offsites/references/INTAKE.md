# Running Offsites — Intake Questions

Ask 3–5 questions at a time. If answers are unavailable, proceed with explicit assumptions and offer options.

## A) Quick intake (minimum)

1) What type of offsite is this (strategy / planning / retro / reset / “burst”)? What does “success” look like in 1–2 sentences?
2) What are the 3–7 target outputs? (Examples: decision, principles, roadmap slice, working agreements, action plan.)
3) Who’s attending (count, roles, seniority)? Who must be present for decisions?
4) Constraints: date window, duration, location constraints, budget band, accessibility needs, time zones.
5) Current state: what’s broken today? What must be different the Monday after the offsite?

## B) Decision + scope clarity

6) What decisions must be made in the room (vs pre-decided)? What is explicitly out of scope?
7) What inputs/data should exist before people arrive? (metrics, customer feedback, roadmap, strategy doc, etc.)
8) Who are the key stakeholders not in the room that need a summary afterward?

## C) Team dynamics (risk check)

9) Are there “elephants in the room” (tension, trust issues, unresolved conflict)? If yes, should we address them directly, in a limited way, or defer/escalate?
10) Is psychological safety low? Any topics that should not be handled in a group setting?

## D) Format preference

11) Should this feel like a **laptops-down whiteboard day** (deep work) or include more presentation/content?
12) How much time should be reserved for connection (fun, shared meals, non-work activity)?
13) Remote-first cadence: is this a one-off event, or do you want a repeatable **burst** every quarter / every 6 months?

## E) Logistics + tooling

14) Venue constraints: office vs offsite venue? Any required rooms (breakouts), whiteboards, supplies?
15) Hybrid/remote attendees? If yes, what’s the plan to keep them first-class participants?
16) Any dietary, travel, security, or privacy constraints?

## F) Output preferences

17) Do you want final deliverables as (a) Markdown in-chat, (b) copy/paste doc templates, or (c) files in a repo?
18) Any house style (terminology, metric names, templates) we should match?

## Data handling and safety

- Do not request credentials, confidential customer data, or personally sensitive details.
- If dynamics are sensitive, ask for anonymized summaries and focus on process/structure.
