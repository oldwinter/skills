# Rubric (Managing Imposter Syndrome)

Score each dimension 1–5. Target **≥20/25** to ship. If any dimension is **≤2**, revise.

## 1) Specificity (1–5)
- 1: Generic pep talk; no episodes; no concrete behaviors.
- 3: Some episodes and actions, but still broad.
- 5: Clear triggers, scripts, behaviors, and a scheduled plan.

## 2) Calibration (1–5)
- 1: Assumes everything is “confidence”; ignores real skill gaps.
- 3: Mentions competence vs confidence but doesn’t operationalize.
- 5: Labels per trigger, with evidence and a learning plan where needed.

## 3) Actionability (1–5)
- 1: Advice-only; no experiments; no schedule.
- 3: Experiments exist but aren’t small/scheduled.
- 5: 3–5 small experiments with pass signals and debrief prompts.

## 4) Support + sustainability (1–5)
- 1: No support loop; encourages solo grinding.
- 3: Mentions support but no scripts/cadence.
- 5: Clear scripts, check-ins, and a maintenance + relapse plan.

## 5) Safety + boundaries (1–5)
- 1: Oversteps into therapy/diagnosis; ignores crisis signals.
- 3: Includes disclaimers but not integrated into workflow.
- 5: Clear boundaries; flags escalation cases; avoids sensitive info.
