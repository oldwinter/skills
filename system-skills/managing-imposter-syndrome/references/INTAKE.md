# Intake (Managing Imposter Syndrome)

Ask **3–5 questions at a time**. Prefer concrete examples over hypotheticals. Don’t request confidential employer information; use redacted details.

## A) Context + stakes
1) What is your role/seniority and what changed recently (new job, new scope, higher visibility, new manager)?
2) What’s the highest-stakes situation that reliably triggers imposter feelings (presenting, shipping, meetings, leadership, interviews)?
3) What would “better” look like in 2–4 weeks (specific behaviors/outcomes)?

## B) Episode capture (pick 1–3 recent examples)
4) Walk me through one recent moment: what happened, what you thought, what you felt, what you did next.
5) What did you avoid, delay, or overdo because of that feeling (silence, perfectionism, overwork, people-pleasing)?
6) What was the cost (time, anxiety, missed opportunities, relationship strain, quality)?

## C) Calibration (confidence vs competence)
7) What evidence suggests you’re actually under-skilled for the task (missing knowledge, repeated errors, lack of practice)?
8) What evidence suggests you’re skilled enough but interpreting uncertainty as failure (past wins, positive feedback, results)?
9) What does “good” look like here—what would a strong peer do in the same situation?

## D) Pattern + beliefs
10) What is the “inner script” in the moment (e.g., “They’ll find out”, “I got lucky”, “I’m behind”)?
11) Which distortions show up most (mind-reading, catastrophizing, discounting positives, all-or-nothing)?
12) What standards are you holding yourself to (and are they realistic for the role/time)?

## E) Support + environment
13) How psychologically safe is your environment (0–10)? What would make it safer?
14) Who can you talk to (manager, mentor, peer)? Who would be unsafe/unhelpful?
15) Do you have regular feedback loops (1:1s, reviews, peer feedback), or are you guessing?

## F) Constraints + plan shape
16) How much time/energy can you realistically dedicate per week to this (minutes/day, hours/week)?
17) Any constraints (privacy, high workload, layoffs, health) that should shape the plan?

## G) Safety boundary (only if relevant signals appear)
18) Are you feeling unable to function day-to-day, having frequent panic, or having thoughts of self-harm?
   - If yes: prioritize professional support and crisis resources before executing this plan.
