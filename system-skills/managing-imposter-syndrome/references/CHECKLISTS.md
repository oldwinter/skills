# Checklists (Managing Imposter Syndrome)

## Preflight checklist (scope + safety)
- [ ] The user’s goal is work/career-focused (not therapy or diagnosis).
- [ ] Out-of-scope risks are flagged (crisis/clinical severity, legal/HR needs).
- [ ] Success criteria is observable (behavior/outcome), not “feel confident.”
- [ ] The plan avoids requesting sensitive/confidential employer information.

## Quality checklist (deliverables)
- [ ] Situation Snapshot names the highest-stakes trigger and the cost of the current coping pattern.
- [ ] Trigger & Pattern Map includes at least 2 episodes and identifies the avoidance/perfectionism loop.
- [ ] Confidence vs competence is labeled per trigger (not globally).
- [ ] Reframes are specific, believable, and change next actions (not generic affirmations).
- [ ] Evidence Bank includes multiple evidence types (outcomes, artifacts, feedback) and a plan to gather missing evidence.
- [ ] Experiment Plan includes 3–5 scheduled actions with pass signals and debrief questions.
- [ ] Support Plan includes at least 1 calibration ask and a check-in cadence.
- [ ] Maintenance plan is tiny enough to sustain (≤20 minutes/week) and includes a relapse response.

## Finalization checklist
- [ ] The pack ends with **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.
- [ ] Risks include: overwork relapse, unsafe environment, lack of feedback loop, plan too ambitious.
- [ ] Next steps include specific actions in the next 7 days with dates (or a scheduling plan).
