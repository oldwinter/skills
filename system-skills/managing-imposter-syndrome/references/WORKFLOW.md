# Workflow Notes (Managing Imposter Syndrome)

This file expands the 7-step workflow in `SKILL.md` with optional depth, decision rules, and common patterns.

## Guiding principles
- **Make it concrete:** work from real episodes, not personality labels.
- **Separate confidence vs competence:** treat skill gaps with learning; treat confidence gaps with calibration + exposure.
- **Prefer small experiments:** your goal is behavior change, not perfect self-esteem.
- **Discomfort can signal growth:** imposter feelings often spike during rapid learning and scope expansion.

## Step 1: Intake + safety boundary
Deliverable: Situation Snapshot + Success Criteria.
- Convert “I want to stop feeling this” into a behavioral outcome:
  - “Speak once per meeting.”
  - “Ship a draft weekly.”
  - “Ask for feedback twice per month.”
  - “Apply for roles without over-polishing.”
- If the user signals crisis/clinical severity, pause and recommend professional support.

## Step 2: Episode capture
Deliverable: Trigger & Pattern Map (draft).
Helpful prompts:
- What was the *first* physical signal (heart rate, tight chest, dread)?
- What did you predict would happen?
- What was the “protective” behavior (avoid, over-prepare, hide)?

## Step 3: Pattern diagnosis (confidence vs competence)
Deliverable: Pattern Map (final) + gap type call.
Decision rule:
- **Competence gap likely** if: repeated objective mistakes, unclear basics, no prior exposure, feedback indicates missing skills.
- **Confidence gap likely** if: outcomes are good, feedback is positive, fear persists regardless of evidence, standards are extreme.
Often it’s mixed: label each trigger as mostly confidence vs competence.

## Step 4: Reframes + growth narrative
Deliverable: Reframe Set + Growth Narrative.
Make reframes believable:
- Bad: “You’re amazing.”
- Better: “Uncertainty is expected in a new scope; my job is to learn in public and deliver iteratively.”
Anchor a “growth zone” framing:
- When you’re uncomfortable, it may mean you’re in a stretch that accelerates learning.

## Step 5: Evidence bank
Deliverable: Evidence Bank + calibration notes.
Evidence types:
- Outcomes (metrics/proxies)
- Artifacts (docs, launches, designs, decisions)
- External feedback (quotes, reviews)
- Scar tissue (hard things you’ve already done)
Calibration note format:
- “Strong evidence I can do X because…”
- “Uncertain about Y; plan to gather evidence by…”

## Step 6: Experiment plan
Deliverable: 2–4 week plan with exposure ladder.
Choose experiments that directly target the avoidance loop:
- Avoidance: not speaking → Experiment: ask one clarifying question each meeting.
- Perfectionism: over-polish → Experiment: ship a v1 draft at 70% quality weekly.
- People-pleasing: over-commit → Experiment: practice a boundary script once per week.
Each experiment should include:
- Schedule (date/time)
- “Pass signal” (what you did) and “learning signal” (what happened)
- Debrief question: “What did I predict vs what occurred?”

## Step 7: Support + maintenance
Deliverable: scripts + routines + relapse plan.
Support is logistics:
- Manager: align expectations, ask for calibration, request feedback on “what good looks like.”
- Mentor/peer: reality-check beliefs, normalize learning curves, rehearse exposures.
Maintenance routines:
- Daily: 2-minute reframe + one micro-action.
- Weekly: evidence bank update + 10-minute reflection.

## Common failure modes (and fixes)
- **Plan is too big:** cut to 2 experiments/week + 1 support touchpoint.
- **Reframes are cheesy:** rewrite using facts, uncertainty, and learning framing.
- **No feedback loop:** add a recurring “calibration” ask (manager/peer).
- **User is in an unsafe environment:** focus on boundaries, support outside work, and/or exit planning (without giving legal advice).
