# Managing Imposter Syndrome

## Scope

**Covers**
- Identifying your imposter “episodes” (triggers → thoughts → feelings → behaviors) and the costs they create
- Reframing imposter feelings as a **normal signal of growth** when you’re stretching (not proof you’re a fraud)
- Separating **confidence gaps** (perception) from **competence gaps** (skills) and choosing the right response
- Building an **evidence bank** (“receipts”) to calibrate self-assessment and reduce distorted thinking
- Designing a short **experiment plan** to act despite doubt (feedback asks, exposure ladder, small deliveries)
- Creating a **support plan** (manager/mentor/peer scripts) and a maintenance routine to prevent relapse

**When to use**
- “I feel like a fraud at work even though I’m performing.”
- “I’m starting a new role / leading a bigger scope and my self-doubt is spiking.”
- “I avoid visibility (speaking up, shipping, applying) because I’m scared I’ll be exposed.”
- “I want a structured plan to manage imposter syndrome, not generic reassurance.”

**When NOT to use**
- You are in (or at risk of) self-harm, suicidal ideation, or a mental health crisis (seek urgent professional help; this skill is not a substitute for care).
- Your core issue is primarily clinical anxiety/depression, trauma, or substance use (get professional support; this can complement but not replace it).
- You need legal/HR guidance for harassment, discrimination, retaliation, or workplace investigation processes.
- You have an objective skill gap that requires training/certification (use this skill only as a support layer alongside a skills plan).

## Inputs

**Minimum required**
- Your role, seniority, and what “good” looks like in your environment (even if approximate)
- 1–3 recent imposter episodes (what happened, what you thought, what you did)
- The highest-stakes trigger (presentation, new team, promotion, code review, leadership meeting, etc.)
- What you’re avoiding or over-doing because of imposter feelings (e.g., perfectionism, silence, overwork)
- Your support context (manager relationship, mentor/peer access) and any constraints (time, privacy)

**Missing-info strategy**
- Ask **3–5 questions at a time** from [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md).
- If the user can’t name episodes, propose common triggers/patterns and let them select + correct.
- If “success criteria” is vague, define a behavioral target (e.g., “speak once per meeting”).
- If there are safety signals (panic, inability to function, self-harm thoughts), stop and recommend professional support.

## Outputs (deliverables)

Produce an **Imposter Syndrome Management Pack** (Markdown in chat; or as files if requested) in this order:

1) **Situation Snapshot + Success Criteria** (context, stakes, what “better” looks like)
2) **Trigger & Pattern Map** (triggers, inner script, distortions, behaviors, costs)
3) **Reframe Set + Growth Narrative** (3–7 reframes + “growth zone” interpretation)
4) **Evidence Bank** (receipts: outcomes, feedback, skills, prior wins) + calibration notes
5) **Experiment Plan (2–4 weeks)** (exposure ladder + feedback loops + delivery plan)
6) **Support Plan + Scripts** (manager/mentor/peer asks; boundaries; check-ins)
7) **Maintenance + Relapse Plan** (daily/weekly routine; what to do when it returns)
8) **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** (always)

## Workflow (7 steps)

### 1) Intake + safety boundary check
- **Inputs:** user context; [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md).
- **Actions:** Confirm the goal (reduce imposter costs, increase healthy visibility). Screen for out-of-scope safety/clinical needs. Define success criteria as behaviors/outcomes.
- **Outputs:** Situation Snapshot + explicit assumptions/unknowns.
- **Checks:** Success criteria is observable; boundaries are stated.

### 2) Capture 1–3 “episodes” (make it concrete)
- **Inputs:** recent examples; stakes; avoidance/perfectionism patterns.
- **Actions:** Write short episode logs: trigger → interpretation → emotion → behavior → consequence. Identify the recurring loop (avoidance, overwork, people-pleasing, silence).
- **Outputs:** Trigger & Pattern Map (first draft).
- **Checks:** At least one controllable behavior is identified (not only feelings).

### 3) Diagnose the thinking pattern (confidence vs competence)
- **Inputs:** episode logs; role expectations; feedback history.
- **Actions:** Separate: (a) **competence gap** (needs skill-building) vs (b) **confidence gap** (distortion/overly harsh standards). Name distortions (mind-reading, catastrophizing, discounting positives).
- **Outputs:** Pattern Map (final) + “gap type” call.
- **Checks:** Each claimed gap has evidence; uncertainties are labeled.

### 4) Build reframes + a “growth zone” narrative
- **Inputs:** pattern map; user values; what’s new/stretching.
- **Actions:** Create 3–7 reframes that are specific and believable. Include a “growth zone” framing: discomfort often accompanies rapid learning and scope increase.
- **Outputs:** Reframe Set + Growth Narrative.
- **Checks:** Reframes are actionable (they change what the user does next), not generic affirmations.

### 5) Build an evidence bank (receipts, not vibes)
- **Inputs:** past outcomes; artifacts; feedback; peers/managers quotes (if available).
- **Actions:** Create an evidence table: wins, metrics/proxies, decisions made, skills demonstrated, external validation. Add “counter-evidence” to catastrophic beliefs.
- **Outputs:** Evidence Bank + calibration notes (what’s strong vs uncertain).
- **Checks:** Each core fear has at least 2 evidence counterpoints or a plan to gather evidence.

### 6) Design a 2–4 week experiment plan (act despite doubt)
- **Inputs:** success criteria; constraints; biggest avoidance.
- **Actions:** Build an exposure ladder (easy→hard) and pick 3–5 experiments (e.g., speak once, ask for feedback, ship a draft, request a review). Add weekly reflection + adjustments.
- **Outputs:** Experiment Plan (2–4 weeks).
- **Checks:** Experiments are small, scheduled, and have pass/fail signals.

### 7) Quality gate + finalize support + maintenance
- **Inputs:** full draft pack.
- **Actions:** Draft scripts for manager/mentor/peer support. Create a daily/weekly routine and a relapse response. Run [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and score with [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md). Add **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.
- **Outputs:** Final Imposter Syndrome Management Pack.
- **Checks:** Plan is realistic for time/energy; includes support; risks and unknowns are explicit.

## Quality gate (required)
- Use [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md).
- Always include: **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**.

## Examples

**Example 1 (new scope):** “I was promoted and now I’m leading cross-functional work. I’m afraid I’ll be exposed as incompetent and I’m overworking. Use `managing-imposter-syndrome` to create a 4-week plan with an evidence bank and an exposure ladder.”  
Expected: pack with episode logs, reframes, evidence bank, experiments, manager script.

**Example 2 (visibility avoidance):** “I avoid speaking in leadership meetings because I assume my questions are dumb. Use `managing-imposter-syndrome` to map my trigger pattern and design a 2-week experiment plan.”  
Expected: trigger map + reframes + scheduled micro-exposures + reflection routine.

**Boundary example:** “I’m having panic attacks daily and can’t function, and I’m thinking about hurting myself.”  
Response: out of scope; advise urgent professional support and local emergency/crisis resources; offer to help later with a gentle plan once safe.
