# Intake (Analyzing User Feedback)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What decision should this analysis inform, and by when?** (roadmap theme, onboarding fixes, launch readiness, messaging, quality bar)
2) **What product area/workflow is in scope?** What’s explicitly out of scope?
3) **What feedback sources are available and accessible?** (support tickets, interviews, sales notes, surveys, reviews, community, logs/analytics)
4) **What time window and approximate volume?** Any known spikes (launch, outage, pricing change)?
5) **Which segments matter?** (persona/ICP, plan tier, lifecycle stage, region, platform)

## Constraints + safety (as needed)
- Any privacy/PII constraints? Can we store verbatims or only short redacted excerpts?
- Is this internal-only or shareable externally?
- Any “must-include” or “must-exclude” sources (e.g., exclude internal users/beta)?

## Output preferences (optional)
- Do you want a combined report, or separate deliverables (table + report + recommendations)?
- Should recommendations be oriented to **PM**, **Eng**, **Support**, **Marketing**, or **Exec** audiences?
- Any existing taxonomy, severity scale, or prioritization framework we should align to?

## If the user can’t provide data
Proceed with:
- A concrete **source inventory + sampling plan**
- A proposed **taxonomy/codebook** (with placeholders)
- A **minimal synthesis** from any sample provided (even 20–50 items)
- Explicit limitations + a plan to increase confidence (what data to collect next)
