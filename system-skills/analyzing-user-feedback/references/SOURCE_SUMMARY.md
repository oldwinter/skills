# Source summary (what was preserved)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/analyzing-user-feedback/SKILL.md`

The original Refound/Lenny skill is insight-heavy and references additional “guest insights” content that is not present in the repository. This skill pack preserves the key themes by converting them into an execution contract and concrete deliverables.

## Preserved insights → where they appear in this skill pack

1) **Focus on reasons users won’t use the product (evaluative research finds friction).**  
Preserved in:
- `../SKILL.md` → Scope (“reasons users won’t use the product”)
- `../SKILL.md` → Workflow steps 3 and 6
- [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) → Theme synthesis checklist (“reasons users won’t use the product”)

2) **Centralize and synthesize feedback from many sources (Product Ops-style aggregation).**  
Preserved in:
- `../SKILL.md` → Outputs (source inventory + normalized table)
- `../SKILL.md` → Workflow step 2
- [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md) → Source inventory table + normalized schema

3) **Bring engineers closer to real feedback (early support/debugging builds loyalty and fixes faster).**  
Preserved in:
- `../SKILL.md` → Outputs (feedback loop plan)
- [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) → Step 8 (engineering support rotation)
- [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md) → Feedback loop plan template

4) **Manual sampling and “open coding” is high-signal (including trace/log review for AI products).**  
Preserved in:
- `../SKILL.md` → Workflow step 3 (open coding)
- [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) → Step 3 and Step 2 (logs/traces)

5) **Create a queryable findings repository to avoid duplicating research.**  
Preserved in:
- [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) → Step 8 (storage/query plan)
- [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) → Durability checklist

## Notes
- The source mentions “For insights from all 56 guests, see `references/guest-insights.md`”, but that file is not available in `sources/refound/raw/analyzing-user-feedback/`. This pack is built from the excerpted insights present in the source SKILL.md.
