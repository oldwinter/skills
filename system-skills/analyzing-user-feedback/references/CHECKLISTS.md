# Checklists (User Feedback Analysis Pack)

Use these checklists before finalizing the deliverables.

## A) Scope + decision readiness
- [ ] The decision this analysis supports is explicit (and dated/time-boxed).
- [ ] In-scope and out-of-scope areas are listed.
- [ ] Time window and sampling strategy are documented.
- [ ] Constraints (PII/internal-only) are honored.

## B) Data coverage + bias controls
- [ ] Source inventory lists all major channels, with inclusions/exclusions explained.
- [ ] Sampling is representative enough for the requested confidence level (or limitations are clearly stated).
- [ ] “Loud users” bias is acknowledged (e.g., support-only view vs broader sentiment).
- [ ] Segment coverage is included where available (tier/persona/lifecycle stage).

## C) Taxonomy/codebook quality
- [ ] Taxonomy includes clear definitions, includes/excludes, and examples.
- [ ] Tag list is small and usable (not 100+ tags without structure).
- [ ] Severity/impact scale is defined and consistently applied.
- [ ] Tagging rules make it feasible for two people to tag similarly.

## D) Theme synthesis quality
- [ ] Top themes are stated in plain language (customer POV).
- [ ] Each theme has representative evidence (quotes/examples) and source attribution.
- [ ] Quantification is included (counts/percentages) with sampling caveats.
- [ ] Root cause hypotheses are separated from verified facts.
- [ ] “Reasons users won’t use the product” are explicitly captured (friction, trust, setup failures).

## E) Recommendations are executable
- [ ] Each recommendation ties to a theme and evidence.
- [ ] Recommendations include time horizon and type (bug/UX/docs/product/messaging).
- [ ] At least 1–3 “quick wins” are included (if appropriate).
- [ ] Open questions are listed with a concrete plan to answer them.

## F) Feedback loop + durability
- [ ] A cadence and owner model is defined (who updates this and when).
- [ ] Engineering participation is defined (triage, support rotation, trace review as needed).
- [ ] Storage/query plan exists (where insights live so teams don’t duplicate research).
- [ ] Final pack includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.
