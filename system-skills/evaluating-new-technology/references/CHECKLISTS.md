# Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing the pack and before committing to a purchase/build.

## 1) Evaluation Pack completeness checklist
- [ ] Problem statement is tool-agnostic and tied to a real workflow.
- [ ] Non-goals are explicit (prevents scope creep).
- [ ] Success metrics and deal breakers are defined.
- [ ] Options include status quo + at least one credible alternative.
- [ ] Criteria are measurable or falsifiable in a pilot.
- [ ] Integration/data flow and migration effort are documented.
- [ ] Build vs buy analysis includes bandwidth + opportunity cost.
- [ ] Risk register lists top risks with owners and mitigations (or “blocker”).
- [ ] Pilot plan is time-boxed with exit criteria (adopt/iterate/reject).
- [ ] Decision memo includes adoption plan and rollback/exit plan.
- [ ] Risks / Open questions / Next steps are included.

## 2) Build vs buy sanity checklist
- [ ] “Core competency” test is answered (differentiator vs table stakes).
- [ ] Maintenance/on-call ownership is explicit (12-month view).
- [ ] Hidden costs considered (security work, upgrades, support, docs, training).
- [ ] Vendor lock-in and exit plan are evaluated (export formats, switching costs).
- [ ] Decision is consistent with current team capacity and priorities.

## 3) AI vendor due diligence checklist (if relevant)
- [ ] Data usage is clear (training on customer data? retention? deletion?).
- [ ] Security posture evidence requested (SOC2/ISO, encryption, audit logs, SSO/RBAC).
- [ ] Prompt injection/jailbreak risk considered; mitigations are defense-in-depth.
- [ ] “Guardrails catch everything” claims are treated as unverified; tested in pilot/red-team.
- [ ] Human approval points and logging are defined for any action-taking behavior.
