# Rubric (Score 1–5)

Score the pack across the dimensions below. Use this to decide whether the evaluation is decision-ready.

## Scoring guidance
- **1 = Weak:** vague, untestable, missing key info, not actionable.
- **3 = Acceptable:** mostly complete, some assumptions, decision possible with caution.
- **5 = Strong:** specific, testable, evidence-driven, operationally ready, risks owned.

## Dimensions

1) **Problem clarity**
- 1: Tool-led framing; no clear workflow or user.
- 3: Clear workflow + user; some ambiguity remains.
- 5: Crisp problem statement + non-goals; stakeholders agree on the job-to-be-done.

2) **Criteria quality**
- 1: Criteria are a feature checklist; no weights or measures.
- 3: Criteria relate to workflows/ROI; some measures are soft.
- 5: Criteria are measurable/falsifiable; weights and deal breakers are explicit.

3) **Options coverage**
- 1: Only one option considered; status quo ignored.
- 3: Multiple options considered; trade-offs captured.
- 5: Status quo + credible alternatives + build/hybrid considered where appropriate.

4) **Evidence strength**
- 1: Mostly opinions; no pilot or validation plan.
- 3: Some evidence (demo/spike/reference) and a reasonable pilot plan.
- 5: Pilot evidence (or strong rationale to skip) ties directly to criteria and metrics.

5) **Build vs buy reasoning**
- 1: Focused on sticker price only.
- 3: Includes some maintenance/bandwidth considerations.
- 5: Includes bandwidth/TCO + opportunity cost + core competency and lock-in/exit plan.

6) **Risk management**
- 1: Risks are generic or missing.
- 3: Risks identified with partial mitigations.
- 5: Top risks have owners, mitigations, and clear “blocker vs monitor” labeling; AI guardrails assumptions are tested.

7) **Decision readiness**
- 1: No clear recommendation or next actions.
- 3: Recommendation exists; adoption steps are rough.
- 5: Clear decision, owner, timeline, adoption + rollback plan; next steps are concrete.

## Suggested pass thresholds
- **Low-risk/internal tooling:** average score ≥ 3.5
- **Customer-facing or sensitive data:** average score ≥ 4.0 and **Risk management ≥ 4**
