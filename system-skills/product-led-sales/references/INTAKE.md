# Product-Led Sales — Intake

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**, then proceed with explicit assumptions if answers aren’t available.

## A) Product + model
1) What does the product do, and what is the primary “first value” moment?
2) What is the self-serve model (freemium vs trial; length; in-product paywall)?
3) Who uses vs who buys? (titles/roles; user/buyer mismatch?)
4) What segments matter (SMB/mid-market/enterprise) and what ACV bands?

## B) Objective + baseline
5) What is the primary objective for product-led sales?
   - trial-to-paid conversion
   - expansion / upgrades
   - higher ACV / packaging upgrades
   - pipeline creation for AEs
6) What are baseline metrics today (even rough)?
   - activation rate
   - % reaching “aha”
   - trial-to-paid
   - expansion rate
   - time-to-first-value
7) What are the current bottlenecks (too many leads, low quality, slow follow-up, no champion, etc.)?

## C) Data + signals
8) What product analytics exists (events/properties tracked)? What’s missing?
9) Can you map users → accounts/companies reliably? How? (email domain, SSO, billing, CRM enrichment)
10) What “high intent” actions exist today? (invites, admin setup, integrations, exports, API keys, billing page visits)
11) Any signals you explicitly **cannot** use in outreach (privacy/compliance/brand)?

## D) Sales workflow + capacity
12) Who will work PQLs/PQAs (SDR/AE/CS), and what is their capacity?
13) What response-time SLA is realistic (minutes/hours/days)?
14) How do you want to route (territories, account ownership, round-robin, by segment)?
15) Where is activity logged (CRM) and what dispositions do you want?

## E) Tooling + constraints
16) What systems are in play (CRM, marketing automation, data warehouse, reverse ETL, support tools)?
17) Any operational constraints: regions, compliance, security reviews, internal approval processes?
18) What tone/brand constraints exist for outreach? (helpful vs direct; formal vs casual)

## F) Pilot parameters
19) Can you run a pilot? If yes: which segment, how long, and what success looks like?
20) What is a “scale trigger” (e.g., +X% conversion, +Y pipeline, no drop in retention/NPS)?
