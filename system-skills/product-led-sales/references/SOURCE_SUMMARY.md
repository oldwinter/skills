# Source Summary — product-led-sales (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/product-led-sales/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill covered
The source skill provides tactical guidance on **product-led sales** (a hybrid motion between PLG/self-serve and traditional sales). It emphasizes that product-led sales converts self-serve usage into a sales opportunity and that sales can use **product usage signals** to trigger timely outreach.

Note: the raw source content appears truncated mid-sentence in the Elena Verna section. This skill pack preserves the available insights and adds the missing execution layers (contracts, workflow, templates, and quality gates).

## Top insights preserved and how they were transformed

1) **“Product-led sales converts the usage … into a sales opportunity” (Elena Verna)**  
Preserved as: the definition in **Scope** and the conversion-oriented deliverables in `../SKILL.md`, plus the funnel/intervention templates in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md).

2) **Sales outreach should be triggered by data signals from product usage (Hila Qu)**  
Preserved as: the signal spec + routing workflow (Steps 3–5 in `../SKILL.md`) and the usage-triggered outreach kit (Step 6), with templates in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md).

## Notes on additions (manufactured execution layers)
The source skill is insight-heavy and light on executable process. This skill pack adds:
- A clear input/output contract and deliverables list
- A 7-step workflow with checks (inputs → actions → outputs → checks)
- Copy/paste templates (signal spec table, routing/SLA, outreach kit, pilot plan)
- Quality gates (checklists + rubric) and required final sections (risks/questions/next steps)

## Assumptions made (because source was sparse)
- Target context: **B2B SaaS** with self-serve usage and the ability to route opportunities to humans.
- “Qualified” is defined as a measurable combination of **depth + breadth + intent**, not a single event.
