# Product-Led Sales — Examples

Use these as “golden prompts” to invoke the skill and as shape examples for outputs.

## Example 1 — Trial conversion with PQLs
Prompt:
“Use `product-led-sales`. We’re a B2B SaaS with a 14-day trial. ICP: data teams at 200–2,000 employee companies. Objective: improve trial-to-paid without spamming users. Signals: activation event, invites, integration setup, billing page views. Sales: 2 SDRs, SLA 2 hours. Output: a Product-Led Sales Motion Pack with PQL definition, routing rules, outreach emails, and a 4-week pilot plan.”

Expected output highlights:
- PQL definition that requires more than a single click (depth + breadth + recency)
- Routing rules that won’t overwhelm 2 SDRs (score threshold + triage)
- Outreach templates that are helpful and avoid creepy wording
- Pilot plan with leading indicators (time-to-first-touch, meeting rate) and guardrails

## Example 2 — Expansion with PQAs
Prompt:
“Use `product-led-sales`. We’re seat-based SaaS. Users self-serve but expansions require IT approval. Objective: grow 20-seat teams into 200-seat contracts. Signals: seat growth, admin setup, SSO request, integration activation. Output: a Motion Pack defining PQAs, scoring, and a sales workflow for expansion.”

Expected output highlights:
- PQA definition that ties qualification to account-level adoption and rollout intent
- Expansion outreach kit aimed at admins/champions (rollout help, best practices)
- Clear RACI between Product, Sales, and CS for expansion

## Boundary example — No product signals / generic outbound
Prompt:
“Teach me product-led sales and write a generic cold email for any product.”

Expected response behavior:
- Ask for product, ICP, objective, and what signals exist (up to 5 questions)
- If signals don’t exist, recommend prerequisites (instrumentation + activation definition) and propose a pilot plan once signals are available
