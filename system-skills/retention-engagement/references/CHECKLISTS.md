# CHECKLISTS (Retention & Engagement)

Use these before finalizing outputs.

## 1) Scope + input checklist
- [ ] The request is primarily retention/engagement/activation (not ICP/value-prop definition).
- [ ] Segment(s) and time horizon are explicit.
- [ ] Retention metric definition is explicit (what counts as “active”).
- [ ] Baseline numbers exist OR assumptions are stated and labeled.
- [ ] Constraints are captured (capacity, channels, privacy/brand).

## 2) Diagnosis checklist
- [ ] Cohort/curve snapshot includes at least 2 segments.
- [ ] The primary failure mode is named (activation failure / engagement decay / monetization churn).
- [ ] The “biggest leak” is explicit (segment × step × timeframe).
- [ ] Root-cause hypotheses are ranked and testable (not generic).
- [ ] Diagnosis points to one primary lever to test first.

## 3) Activation / “aha moment” checklist
- [ ] 3–5 candidate value behaviors were considered.
- [ ] Chosen activation definition is behavioral + measurable (not opinion-based).
- [ ] A threshold window is defined (e.g., “within 7/14 days”).
- [ ] Validation plan exists (how you’ll confirm correlation/causality).
- [ ] Tracking requirements are specified (events + properties).

## 4) Experiment backlog checklist
- [ ] Each experiment is tied to a named failure mode and hypothesis.
- [ ] Each experiment has a primary success metric + leading indicator(s).
- [ ] Guardrails are defined (trust, revenue, spam/complaints, performance).
- [ ] Instrumentation needs and rollout/rollback are included.
- [ ] Top 3 experiments are feasible within stated constraints.

## 5) Measurement + instrumentation checklist
- [ ] Every metric has a clear event definition and data source.
- [ ] Dashboards are specified for the team to review on a cadence.
- [ ] The plan distinguishes short-term leading indicators vs long-term retention outcomes.

## 6) Safety + ethics checklist
- [ ] No dark patterns (“nagging”, coercive streaks, misleading UI).
- [ ] Messaging frequency is capped and includes opt-out where applicable.
- [ ] No request for secrets/credentials; no collection of unnecessary PII.
- [ ] “Mounting loss” is implemented ethically (user control, transparency, export where relevant).

## 7) Final pack checklist (definition of done)
- [ ] Includes: diagnosis, activation spec, lever map, prioritized backlog, measurement plan, 30/60/90 plan.
- [ ] Includes: **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.
- [ ] Ready for a team to execute for the next 2 weeks without additional clarification.
