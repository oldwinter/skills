# Rubric (score 1–5; 3 = acceptable)

## 1) Outcome alignment + scope clarity
**1** Rituals are generic; outcomes are unclear.  
**3** Outcomes are defined; rituals generally map to them.  
**5** Outcomes are crisp, measurable-ish, and every ritual earns its slot.

## 2) Minimalism + time efficiency
**1** Adds meetings or ignores time budget.  
**3** Fits within a stated time budget with some trade-offs.  
**5** Actively reduces meeting load and replaces status with async patterns.

## 3) Template + artifact quality (repeatability)
**1** No templates; outputs are vague.  
**3** Templates exist and are usable; outputs are mostly clear.  
**5** Templates are timeboxed, artifact-first, and produce durable outputs (decisions/commitments/learnings).

## 4) Adoption + onboarding readiness (first Friday)
**1** No onboarding; rituals rely on tribal knowledge.  
**3** Onboarding primer exists; templates are findable.  
**5** A new hire can run a ritual by first Friday using clear docs and examples.

## 5) Governance + iteration (avoid sprawl)
**1** No owner or review cadence; rituals accumulate.  
**3** Owners and a review cadence exist.  
**5** Clear keep/change/kill mechanism with feedback loop and retirement rules.

## 6) Trust, inclusion, and async-friendliness
**1** Rituals feel like surveillance; exclude time zones or quiet voices.  
**3** Basic async participation and psychological safety considerations exist.  
**5** Rituals are inclusive by design (doc-first, async paths, rotating times) and improve trust.

## Scoring interpretation
- **24–30:** Excellent; ready to adopt.
- **18–23:** Good; address minor gaps.
- **12–17:** Risky; revise before rollout.
- **<12:** Not usable; redesign the system.
