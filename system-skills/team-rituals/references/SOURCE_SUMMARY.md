# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → executable skill pack)

## Source
- `sources/refound/raw/team-rituals/SKILL.md`
- Title: “Designing Team Rituals”
- Category: Hiring & Teams
- Format: tactical advice distilled from 2 product leaders (2 insights).

Note: The source content in-repo is short and primarily insight-level. This skill pack preserves the key ideas that are present and adds an executable contract (inputs/outputs, workflow, templates, checklists).

## Core insights preserved → rules/checks

### 1) Rituals are the engine of great teams (not just meeting hygiene)
- **Rule:** Design rituals as mechanisms that produce alignment, decisions, learning, and belonging—each ritual must output a durable artifact.
- **Check:** Does every ritual have a clear purpose and a concrete output (decisions/priorities/actions/learnings)?

### 2) Golden Rituals: named, templated, and known by first Friday
- **Rule:** Keep a small list (3–7) of “Golden Rituals” that are **Named**, **Templated**, and explicitly onboarded so new hires know them by their first Friday.
- **Check:** Can a new hire find the ritual index and run a ritual using the template within week 1?

## What this skill pack adds (to make it agent-executable)
- A clear **input/output contract** and a 7-step workflow.
- Copy/paste **templates** for auditing, designing, documenting, and rolling out rituals.
- **Checklists** and a **rubric** to validate quality and avoid ritual sprawl.
