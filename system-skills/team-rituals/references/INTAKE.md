# Intake Questions (pick 3–5 at a time)

## 1) Team context
1) What team is this (function(s), size, seniority mix)? Any cross-functional dependencies?
2) Remote/hybrid/in-office? What time zones must be respected?
3) What stage are you in (0→1, scaling, turnaround)? What’s changing soon (hiring, new manager, reorg)?

## 2) What’s broken + desired outcomes
4) What are the symptoms today (missed decisions, slow execution, low trust, unclear priorities, too many meetings)?
5) If the ritual system is a success in 6 weeks, what will be different? (2–3 measurable signals)
6) What must not happen? (e.g., “no extra meeting load”, “no surveillance vibe”, “works async”)

## 3) Current cadence (audit inputs)
7) What recurring meetings/rituals exist today (name, cadence, duration)?
8) Which ones are high-value and should be protected?
9) Which ones are painful or redundant—and why?

## 4) Decision-making + artifacts
10) How are decisions made today (who decides what)? Where do decisions get recorded?
11) What artifacts do you want to standardize (weekly priorities, decision log, retro notes, action tracker)?
12) What tools do you use (calendar, docs, Slack/Teams, ticketing, Notion/Confluence/Drive)?

## 5) Constraints + inclusion
13) What’s your weekly meeting time budget per person (roughly)?
14) Any accessibility or inclusion constraints (rotating times, recordings, async participation)?
15) Any cultural constraints (e.g., “avoid too much process”, “high autonomy”, “fast decisions”)?

## 6) Rollout
16) Who can sponsor/enforce this change (manager, founder, team lead)?
17) Do you prefer a pilot (2–3 rituals first) or a full cadence reset?
18) What should every new hire know by their first Friday?
