# Examples

These are end-to-end example outputs for smoke-testing.

## Example 1 — Remote cross-functional team (reduce chaos, increase decision velocity)

### Context snapshot
- Team: 12 people (PM, Design, Eng, Data)
- Work mode: Remote (PST/EST)
- Symptoms: too many meetings; unclear decisions; priorities change mid-week
- Desired outcomes: clearer weekly priorities; faster decisions; fewer ad hoc syncs
- Constraints: ≤4 hours/week recurring sync time per person; doc-first

### Golden Rituals shortlist (illustrative)
1) **Weekly North Star** (weekly priorities + trade-offs)
2) **Decision Review** (make/record decisions; unblock escalations)
3) **Async Daily Pulse** (status + blockers; replaces standup)
4) **Retro & Learn** (learning cadence; process improvements)

### One ritual spec (excerpt)
**Ritual name:** Decision Review  
**Cadence:** 2×/week, 30 min  
**Owner:** rotating facilitator (weekly)  
**Outputs:** decisions recorded in a decision log; owner/due date for follow-ups  
**Async fallback:** proposals are posted 24h before; non-attendees comment async; summary posted after

### Risks / open questions / next steps (excerpt)
- Risks: decision review could become status; facilitators may not enforce doc-first
- Open questions: which decisions require exec input vs team-level autonomy?
- Next steps: pilot “Async Daily Pulse” + “Decision Review” for 2 weeks; measure ad hoc pings and perceived clarity

## Example 2 — In-office team (new manager, accountability without surveillance)

High-level expected outcome:
- Keep rituals minimal (3–5), artifact-first, and focused on clarity and support.
- Add a weekly priorities ritual + 1:1 structure + retro cadence; avoid public “accountability theatre.”

## Boundary example — “Install OKRs company-wide”

Response pattern:
- Clarify scope; propose using `setting-okrs-goals` for OKR design.
- Use this skill only to define the team-level rituals that support the already-agreed goals (weekly priorities, decision log, retro).
