# Team Rituals

## Scope

**Covers**
- Designing a **small set of high-leverage team rituals** that drive alignment, execution, learning, and belonging
- Turning rituals into an **operating system** (not “more meetings”): named rituals, clear owners, repeatable templates, and explicit outputs
- Creating “Golden Rituals” that are **Named**, **Templated**, and **Known by every new hire by their first Friday**

**When to use**
- “Our meetings are chaotic; design a better team cadence.”
- “Define our team operating system / rituals / ceremonies.”
- “Create named, templated Golden Rituals and a one-pager for onboarding.”
- “We need better alignment and decision velocity without adding meeting load.”

**When NOT to use**
- You need to define company values, org design, or strategy from scratch (do that first; rituals should express decisions you’ve made)
- You need help facilitating a single workshop/meeting agenda only (this skill produces an end-to-end ritual system)
- You need HR/legal policy guidance (this is not compliance or legal advice)
- You’re trying to use rituals for surveillance or performance policing (this will backfire; redesign for trust and psychological safety)

## Inputs

**Minimum required**
- Team type + size + composition (functions; cross-functional vs single function)
- Work mode: remote/hybrid/in-office + time zones
- What’s currently broken (symptoms) + what you want to improve (outcomes)
- Existing cadence/rituals (or “none”) and what people hate about them
- Constraints: meeting time budget, decision-making model, tooling (calendar/docs/chat)

**Missing-info strategy**
- Ask up to 5 questions from [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md) (3–5 at a time).
- If inputs are still missing, proceed with clearly labeled assumptions and provide 2–3 options.
- Do not request secrets. If context is sensitive, ask for redacted/high-level descriptions.

## Outputs (deliverables)

Produce a **Team Rituals Pack** in Markdown (in-chat; or as files if the user requests):

1) **Context snapshot** (team, work mode, constraints, goals)
2) **Ritual inventory audit** (current rituals + what to keep/change/kill)
3) **Golden Rituals shortlist** (3–7 named rituals mapped to outcomes)
4) **Ritual specs + templates** (one spec per Golden Ritual: purpose, cadence, owner, agenda, outputs, anti-patterns)
5) **Onboarding primer** (“Known by first Friday”: 1-page cheatsheet + where templates live)
6) **Rollout plan** (pilot, comms, calendar/docs setup, training)
7) **Governance plan** (review cadence, feedback loop, metrics, retirement/iteration rules)
8) **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** (always included)

## Workflow (7 steps)

### 1) Intake + outcome definition (what the rituals are for)
- **Inputs:** user context; [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md).
- **Actions:** Clarify the top 2–3 outcomes (e.g., alignment, decision speed, execution reliability, learning). Set constraints (time budget, remote/async needs). Define what “good” feels like in 4–6 bullets.
- **Outputs:** Context snapshot + outcome list + constraints.
- **Checks:** You can explain the “why” in one sentence (“We’re doing this to ____ without ____.”).

### 2) Audit what exists (keep / change / kill)
- **Inputs:** current meeting list/cadence; pain points.
- **Actions:** Build a ritual inventory table. For each ritual: purpose, participants, cadence, outputs, and whether it’s working. Identify duplicates and “status-only” meetings.
- **Outputs:** Ritual inventory audit with a keep/change/kill recommendation.
- **Checks:** Every existing ritual has an explicit purpose and output; “kill” items have a replacement or rationale.

### 3) Design rules + time budget (make it a system, not meetings)
- **Inputs:** outcomes + audit.
- **Actions:** Define a small set of design rules (named, templated, artifact-first, owner-driven, async-by-default). Establish a weekly meeting time budget and decide what must be synchronous vs async.
- **Outputs:** Ritual design principles + time budget + naming scheme.
- **Checks:** Total sync time stays within budget; each ritual has an owner and an artifact output.

### 4) Select 3–7 “Golden Rituals” (the minimal set)
- **Inputs:** outcomes + principles + constraints.
- **Actions:** Propose 3–7 Golden Rituals that cover: alignment, decisions, execution, learning, and belonging (as needed). Name them with memorable, team-relevant names.
- **Outputs:** Golden Rituals shortlist + mapping table (ritual → outcome).
- **Checks:** Each Golden Ritual earns its slot; no “nice-to-have” meetings.

### 5) Write ritual specs + templates (make them repeatable)
- **Inputs:** Golden Rituals shortlist; [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).
- **Actions:** For each Golden Ritual, produce a spec: purpose, cadence, roles, agenda/format, prep, outputs, follow-ups, and anti-patterns. Create the corresponding agenda/notes template.
- **Outputs:** One “Ritual Spec” per Golden Ritual + copy/paste templates.
- **Checks:** Rituals are **Named** and **Templated**; outputs are explicit (decisions, priorities, action list, learnings).

### 6) Make them “Known by first Friday” (onboarding + rollout)
- **Inputs:** Ritual specs; onboarding constraints.
- **Actions:** Create a 1-page onboarding primer and a rollout plan: pilot order, comms, calendar creation, where templates live, and how new hires learn the rituals in week 1.
- **Outputs:** Onboarding primer + rollout plan.
- **Checks:** A new hire can find the rituals, understand purpose, and run one using templates by their first Friday.

### 7) Governance + quality gate (iterate, don’t accumulate)
- **Inputs:** full draft pack.
- **Actions:** Define governance: ritual owners, quarterly review, feedback loop, and retirement rules. Run [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and score with [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md). Add **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.
- **Outputs:** Final Team Rituals Pack.
- **Checks:** The pack is minimal, adoptable, and has a way to evolve without ritual sprawl.

## Quality gate (required)
- Use [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md).
- Always include: **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**.

## Examples

**Example 1 (fix chaotic cadence):** “We’re a 12-person product+engineering team (remote across PST/EST). Meetings feel random and we keep missing decisions. Design Golden Rituals, write templates, and create a first-Friday onboarding primer.”  
Expected: a small set of named rituals with templates, mapped to outcomes, plus rollout + governance.

**Example 2 (new manager operating system):** “I’m inheriting a team of 7 ICs with low accountability and unclear priorities. Create a weekly operating cadence with minimal meetings and clear artifact outputs.”  
Expected: ritual inventory audit + a minimal Golden Rituals set + artifact-first templates.

**Boundary example:** “Fix our company culture.”  
Response: ask what specifically is broken and at what scope; propose a small team-level ritual system only, or suggest doing values/strategy/org work first.
