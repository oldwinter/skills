# Examples (Expanded)

Use these as “smoke tests” for the skill: the output should be a concrete Presentation Pack, not generic advice.

## Example 1 — All-hands update (inform + align)

**User prompt**
“Create a 7-minute all-hands presentation: what we shipped this quarter, what’s next, and what help we need from other teams. Audience is the whole company. I have bullets and a few metrics.”

**Expected outputs**
- Presentation brief (goal, audience, ask)
- Contrast narrative (“what is” shipped/learned vs “what could be” next quarter outcomes)
- Slide-by-slide outline (6–9 slides) with talk track bullets and time budget
- Q&A bank (e.g., resourcing, priorities, dependencies)
- Rehearsal plan (timed run + record/review) and delivery cues for confidence

## Example 2 — Exec decision review (persuade + decide)

**User prompt**
“I need a 12-minute exec review proposing a new onboarding flow. Ask: approve a 4-week experiment with one engineer and one designer. Audience: CEO, CFO, Head of Sales.”

**Expected outputs**
- Narrative contrast centered on business impact (e.g., activation, pipeline, retention)
- Proof plan (metrics, funnel screenshots, customer evidence)
- Objection bank with stakeholder-specific questions (CFO: cost; Sales: lead quality; CEO: strategy)
- Pre-brief plan targeting the most skeptical stakeholder first

## Boundary example — Pure aesthetics request

**User prompt**
“Make my slides prettier.”

**Expected behavior**
- Ask whether the problem is structure/narrative vs visual design.
- If it’s purely aesthetics, recommend brand/design-system alignment or a designer; do not invent business content.
