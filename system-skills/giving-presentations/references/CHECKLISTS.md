# Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing the Presentation Pack.

## 1) Brief + ask checklist
- The **ask** is explicit and can be stated in one sentence.
- The audience and decision-makers are identified.
- The outcome (inform/align/decide/persuade) matches the ask.
- Constraints and “do not mention” topics are captured.

## 2) Narrative (contrast) checklist
- “What is” describes a real current reality (not generic) with at least 1 concrete example or metric.
- “What could be” is specific and measurable where possible.
- The story answers: **Why now?** and **Why this approach?**
- Supporting points are limited (2–4) and mapped to evidence.
- The ask logically follows from the contrast.

## 3) Slides + talk track checklist
- Each slide has **one takeaway**.
- Slide text is minimal; the talk track carries nuance.
- Jargon is defined or removed for the audience.
- Timing fits the slot with 10–20% buffer.
- The opening sets context fast; the ending repeats the ask and next steps.

## 4) Q&A + objection checklist
- Top 10 questions are listed (prioritized by likelihood and risk).
- Each answer has: short answer + proof + fallback follow-up.
- Known objections from stakeholders are explicitly addressed.

## 5) De-risking (pre-brief) checklist
- The most influential stakeholders are pre-briefed.
- Pre-brief notes are captured and a change log exists.
- No key decision-maker is surprised by the ask in the live meeting.

## 6) Rehearsal + delivery checklist
- You’ve done at least 1 timed rehearsal out loud.
- You’ve recorded yourself and made at least 1 concrete improvement (pacing, filler words, clarity).
- You’ve practiced answering hard questions.
- Delivery cues are defined (pause points; “think up” cue to avoid looking down).
- Logistics are confirmed (room/Zoom; backups available).
