# Intake questions (ask 3–5, then proceed)

## Platform context
1) Is this an **internal**, **external**, or **hybrid** platform? Who is the platform owner?
2) What are the top 1–3 **user groups** (developers, data scientists, partners, customers)? How many today?
3) What is the “job” the platform enables? What outcome improves if the platform works?
4) What exists today (APIs, services, SDKs, docs, paved roads)? What is painful or slow?
5) What is the “why now” (deadline, scaling bottleneck, competitive pressure, AI shift, reliability incident)?

## Surface area + boundaries
6) What capabilities are candidates for the platform (auth, deployment, observability, data access, model serving, payments, etc.)?
7) What decisions do domain teams repeatedly re-make today (and which should become defaults)?
8) What integration points must exist (SSO, data pipelines, event bus, logging, billing, quotas)?
9) What is the desired contract for consumers (APIs, SDKs, UI, CLI)? Any backwards-compat/versioning constraints?

## Ecosystem + lifecycle
10) Who are the ecosystem participants (builders, users, partners, marketplaces)? What do they get?
11) What is your best hypothesis for a **compounding loop** (network effects, data flywheel, distribution)?
12) What “stage” are you in today (internal paved road, partner beta, public platform)? What evidence supports that?
13) What open/close decisions are being considered (public API, approvals, pricing, first-party vs third-party parity)?

## Governance + risk
14) What are the key constraints: security, privacy/compliance (PII/PHI), regions, SLOs, cost ceilings?
15) What is your risk tolerance (can you break partners, can you ship betas, what is unacceptable)?
16) Who owns incident response/support for platform consumers? What support capacity exists?

## AI-specific (if relevant)
17) What are the AI use cases (assist, generate, automate, agents)? What “context” is required to do them well?
18) Where does context live today (docs, tickets, repos, databases)? What data is sensitive?
19) What are the required guardrails (permissions, audit logs, human approvals, evals, monitoring)?

## Operating model
20) Who will own platform PM responsibilities? What is the resourcing for the next 6–12 months?
21) What metrics matter most (cycle time, adoption, reliability, cost, revenue, integration success)?
22) What’s the decision deadline and who must be aligned?
