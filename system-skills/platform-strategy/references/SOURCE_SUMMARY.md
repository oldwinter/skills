# Source summary

## Source
- `sources/refound/raw/platform-strategy/SKILL.md`

Note: The Refound skill references `references/guest-insights.md` for deeper quotes from 24 guests; that file was not present in the provided source folder. This skill pack preserves and operationalizes the “Top Insights” present in the source `SKILL.md` and adds executable structure (contracts, workflow, templates, checklists).

## Preserved insights → rules/checks

### 1) Platforms are products (not just infrastructure)
Source: Camille Fournier  
- **Rule:** Treat internal platforms as products: explicit users, a PM/owner, roadmap, and outcome metrics.
- **Check:** Does the pack define user promise + non-goals + productivity outcomes (e.g., cycle time)?

### 2) Platforms have a lifecycle (conditions → moat → open → close)
Source: Brian Balfour  
- **Rule:** Every platform strategy must include a stage diagnosis and explicit open/close decisions for the near term.
- **Check:** Is the stage justified with evidence and does the plan include governance + transition risks?

### 3) Clear platforms reduce decision complexity
Source: Jeremy Henrickson  
- **Rule:** Define platform boundaries + interfaces + paved-road defaults so domain teams stop re-making foundational decisions.
- **Check:** Can a domain team ship faster without re-deciding auth/logging/deployment/guardrails?

### 4) Ecosystems win via compounding loops (“gardening”)
Source: Alex Komoroske  
- **Rule:** Identify at least one measurable compounding loop and use “investment gates” to scale investment only after signals.
- **Check:** Does the pack define a causal loop and leading indicators (activation, retained builders, integration success)?

### 5) For AI platforms, build a system + context repository (“Swiss Army toolkit”)
Source: Aparna Chennapragada  
- **Rule:** Build defensibility as a system: shared context repository + integrated experiences (autocomplete, chat, agents) with consistent policies.
- **Check:** Does the strategy define context sources, permissions/audit, eval/monitoring, and a coherent experience surface?
