# Rubric (score 1–5 each)

Use this rubric to quality-gate the Platform Strategy Pack before finalizing.

## 1) Clarity of scope and user promise
1: Vague “be a platform” language; unclear users/jobs.  
3: Users/jobs are stated; some non-goals; still some ambiguity.  
5: Clear user promise, explicit non-goals, and assumptions; stakeholders can restate the value in one sentence.

## 2) Platform-as-product operating model
1: No owner/PM, no intake or feedback loop; “infra project” framing.  
3: Partial operating model; metrics exist but not tied to outcomes.  
5: Clear ownership, cadence, intake, support/docs plan, and metrics tied to user outcomes.

## 3) Surface area and boundary design
1: Inventory missing; boundaries unclear; platform likely to become a bottleneck.  
3: Some surface mapping; defaults exist but incomplete.  
5: Surface map + boundary contract + paved-road defaults are explicit and reduce decision complexity.

## 4) Lifecycle stage and strategic coherence
1: Stage is implied; decisions are aspirational or contradictory.  
3: Stage is chosen but weakly evidenced; open/close plan incomplete.  
5: Stage is evidence-based; near-term open/close decisions are explicit with trade-offs and transition risks.

## 5) Ecosystem and moat logic
1: “Network effects” claimed without a loop or incentives.  
3: Loop exists but incentives/signals are fuzzy.  
5: Compounding loop is causal and measurable; incentives are aligned; seeding + investment gates are defined.

## 6) Governance and sustainability
1: Public/open plans without support/versioning; high ecosystem debt risk.  
3: Some governance; sustainability gaps remain.  
5: Governance covers access, quotas, versioning/deprecation, parity, and support/docs/incident readiness.

## 7) AI system defensibility (if applicable)
1: AI features listed; no context/permissions/eval plan.  
3: Context plan exists but policies/monitoring incomplete.  
5: Context repository + integrated experiences + least-privilege governance + eval/monitoring are coherent and auditable.

## 8) Roadmap realism and decision-readiness
1: Wishlist roadmap; no sequencing, dependencies, or owners.  
3: Roadmap exists but resourcing/dependencies unclear.  
5: Sequenced Now/Next/Later roadmap with dependencies, resourcing assumptions, rollback/exit paths, and clear next actions.
