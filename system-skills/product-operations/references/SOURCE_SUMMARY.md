# Source Summary (Product Operations)

This skill pack was generated from `sources/refound/raw/product-operations/SKILL.md`, which contained tactical insights from multiple product leaders about Product Operations.

## Core insights preserved

1) **Product Ops as the bridge between Product and Ops (and other functions).**  
Product Ops often sits close to the product team while maintaining operational accountability, reducing coordination overhead and improving execution.

2) **Product Ops builds systems that help product teams thrive.**  
The work is less about one-off heroics and more about repeatable mechanisms: cadences, templates, routing, and clarity of ownership.

3) **Product Ops enables scaling by standardizing outputs and check-ins.**  
At higher team velocity, standardized roadmaps, updates, and cross-functional rituals prevent confusion and “status theater”.

4) **Product Ops informs decisions; it does not take decision rights from PMs.**  
A key boundary is to support PM decision-making with better inputs, artifacts, and process—without becoming a shadow PM org.

5) **Product Ops is critical when product management at scale becomes hard.**  
It helps surface insights, standardize product communication, and operationalize shipping and enablement.

## How those insights were transformed

The original content was “insight-heavy.” This pack converts those insights into:
- A clear **execution contract** (inputs/outputs/workflow/quality gates)
- A set of **deliverables** (charter, operating model, cadences, templates, insights pipeline, enablement system)
- **Checklists and a rubric** to validate the pack and prevent common failure modes (over-process, shadow ownership)
