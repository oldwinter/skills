# Checklists (Product Operations)

Use these before finalizing the **Product Ops Operating System Pack**.

## Pack completeness (must-have)
- Charter includes **scope + non-goals** and explicitly preserves PM decision rights.
- Operating model includes **engagement model** (intake + prioritization) and an ownership/RACI table.
- Cadence calendar defines 3–6 core rituals with **outputs**, not just meetings.
- Artifact library includes 3–6 reusable templates with clear owners and audiences.
- Insights pipeline defines **intake → triage → routing → reporting** with owners/cadence.
- Release enablement process includes tiering and a minimum viable enablement bundle.
- 30/60/90 plan includes a pilot, success metrics, and iteration plan.
- Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.

## Quality (high-signal, low-bureaucracy)
- Processes are **proportionate** to org stage and release risk (no “process for process’s sake”).
- Templates are lightweight and can be completed in <15 minutes unless explicitly justified.
- Each ritual/artifact has a consumer; removes or reduces “status theater”.
- Interfaces reduce cross-functional surprises (Support/Sales/CS know what’s coming).
- Insights routing leads to decisions (no orphan feedback).

## Boundary checks (avoid common failure modes)
- Product Ops is not a “PM substitute” and does not become the default owner of strategy/prioritization.
- Avoids creating parallel roadmaps or shadow decision forums.
- Avoids over-centralizing: includes a plan for feedback and iteration with PMs/teams.

## Adoption + change management
- Names 1–2 pilot areas and explains why.
- Includes rollout comms: who needs to change behavior and what they do differently.
- Defines how to measure value (1–3 metrics) and when to revise the system.
