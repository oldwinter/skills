# Intake (Product Operations)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What’s the product org context?** (B2B/B2C, stage, #PMs, #pods, centralized vs distributed)
2) **What’s breaking right now?** Top 3 frictions (e.g., roadmap chaos, surprise launches, unclear ownership, noisy feedback, stakeholder trust).
3) **What outcomes do you want in 30–90 days?** (faster cycle time, fewer surprises, clearer comms, better decisions, less PM overhead)
4) **Who are the key stakeholders and decision owners?** (Head of Product, Eng leads, Data, Ops, Sales, CS, Support)
5) **What “operating cadence” exists today?** (planning/OKRs, roadmap updates, release process, QBRs) What’s painful about it?

## Process + tooling (as needed)
- What artifact(s) do stakeholders complain about? (roadmaps, updates, docs, enablement)
- What tooling constraints exist? (Jira/Linear, Notion/Confluence, Slack, dashboards, CRM)
- Do you need embedded Product Ops per area, or a centralized function? Any reporting-line constraints?
- Any compliance/privacy constraints? (PII, regulated environments, approvals)

## Output preferences (optional)
- Should the pack be optimized for **Head of Product**, **PM team**, or **cross-functional** audiences?
- Preferred cadence complexity: minimal viable vs full operating system
- Any existing templates you must keep or terminology to use?

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A clear assumption about org stage and constraints
- A minimal viable Product Ops charter + cadence set
- A small artifact library (3–5 core templates)
- A simple insights pipeline (intake → triage → routing → reporting)
- A 30/60/90 plan with a pilot area and measurement targets
