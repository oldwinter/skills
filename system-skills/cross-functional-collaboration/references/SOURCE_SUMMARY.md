# Source Summary — Cross-functional Collaboration (Refound/Lenny)

This skill pack was derived from the Refound/Lenny skill: `sources/refound/raw/cross-functional-collaboration/SKILL.md`.

The source is primarily **insights**. This pack operationalizes the excerpted insights into rules, checks, and reusable artifacts.

## What was preserved (key insights → operational rules)

### Share credit (Camille Fournier)
- **Rule:** Default to credit sharing; ensure partner functions get visibility for their work.
- **In pack:** Credit & Recognition Plan template + checklist items to prevent credit hoarding.

### Validate competing goals (“Yes, and…”) (Adam Grenier)
- **Rule:** Treat conflicting goals as potentially simultaneously valid; reconcile via constraints and tradeoffs.
- **In pack:** Conflict Protocol template + workflow Step 6.

### Define expectations of each other (Nikita Miller)
- **Rule:** Alignment improves when leaders write expectations *of counterparts* (not just their own role).
- **In pack:** Expectations matrix in the Roles & Expectations Contract template + Step 3 workflow.

### Include subject matter experts in the mission (Alex Hardimen)
- **Rule:** Ensure domain experts are embedded in cross-functional work when they shape the product outcome.
- **In pack:** Stakeholder mapping guidance (“missing seats”) + intake prompts to include SMEs early.

### Use prototypes as shared language (Amjad Masad)
- **Rule:** Use working artifacts (prototypes/working slices) to reduce siloed interpretation and handoff friction.
- **In pack:** Artifact plan + “prototype-first” workflow Step 4.

## What was added (to make it agent-executable)
- A concrete **Cross-Functional Collaboration Pack** output contract (what to produce, in what order).
- Templates for charter, stakeholder map, expectations contract, cadence plan, decision log, conflict protocol, and credit plan.
- A checklist + rubric to make collaboration quality testable and repeatable.
