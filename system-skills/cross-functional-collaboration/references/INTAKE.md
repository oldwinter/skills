# Intake (Cross-functional Collaboration)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What is the initiative and why now?** What outcome(s) matter and by when?
2) **Who is involved?** Functions/teams + key people; who is the overall driver/DRI?
3) **What’s broken today?** Concrete examples of friction (rework, slow decisions, unclear ownership, conflict, “surprise constraints”).
4) **What are the non-negotiables?** Deadlines, customer commitments, policies/compliance, budget/headcount, quality bar.
5) **What decisions must be made soon?** Any known hard tradeoffs or constraints between teams?

## Context + constraints (as needed)
- Are there required subject matter experts (legal, compliance, editors, operations, support, etc.)?
- What artifacts exist already (PRD/spec, roadmap, design mocks, metrics dashboards)?
- Time zones/remote constraints and preferred communication channels.
- Any history between teams (prior incidents) that will shape trust or conflict patterns.

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A conservative Mission Charter with explicit assumptions and a short list of unknowns
- A draft stakeholder map that flags “missing seats” and likely approvers
- A default cadence (weekly sync + async update) and a minimal decision protocol
- The first 3–5 questions the team should answer in the kickoff
