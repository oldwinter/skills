# Examples — Cross-functional Collaboration

## Example 1 — Cross-functional product initiative (typical)
**Scenario:** You’re a Product Lead running a 10-week onboarding revamp with Product/Eng/Design/Data/Marketing.

**Good output includes:**
- Mission charter with activation metric definition + non-negotiables
- Stakeholder/incentives map that includes Support/CS (to avoid launch surprises)
- Roles & expectations contract with explicit decision rights and escalation triggers
- Cadence: weekly decision-focused sync + async updates; clear doc hub
- Decision log seeded with the top 5 decisions (e.g., segment focus, UX tradeoffs, rollout approach)
- Conflict protocol and explicit credit plan (rotating demos; named contributors in exec updates)

## Example 2 — Engineering-led initiative (reduce rework)
**Scenario:** You’re an Engineering Manager partnering with PM+Design to migrate a legacy UI to a new platform; teams keep re-litigating scope.

**Good output includes:**
- Clear decision protocol (who decides on scope vs tech approach)
- Prototype/working-slice milestone to de-risk UX + technical feasibility early
- Decision log capturing “why we chose X” to prevent re-litigating
- Cadence that minimizes meetings and maximizes artifact review

## Boundary example — Not a collaboration problem
**Scenario:** “My partner team isn’t delivering; they keep missing deadlines.”

**Better response:**
- Determine if this is a performance/accountability issue (use `having-difficult-conversations`) or a planning issue (use `managing-timelines`).
- Use this skill only if the root cause is unclear roles, decision rights, incentives, or operating cadence.
