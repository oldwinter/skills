# Rubric — Cross-functional Collaboration (1–5)

Score the Collaboration Pack before finalizing. Total score helps decide whether to proceed with assumptions or do another intake round.

## 1) Mission clarity + success metrics
1 = Vague mission; no metrics; no timeframe  
3 = Mission stated; some metrics/constraints unclear  
5 = Mission + metrics + timeframe are explicit and testable

## 2) Stakeholder completeness + incentives
1 = Missing key stakeholders; incentives unknown  
3 = Stakeholders listed; incentives partially captured  
5 = Full map; incentives/concerns clear; no surprise approvers likely

## 3) Roles, expectations, and decision rights
1 = “Everyone owns it”; decision rights unclear  
3 = Responsibilities exist; escalation triggers vague  
5 = Contract is explicit; decision rights + triggers + review cadence are clear

## 4) Shared artifacts and source of truth
1 = No artifact plan; doc sprawl likely  
3 = Some artifacts; source of truth unclear  
5 = Minimal artifact set; clear source of truth; prototype/working slice reduces ambiguity

## 5) Operating cadence + decision velocity
1 = Meeting-heavy or no cadence; decisions re-litigated  
3 = Cadence exists; decision log partially used  
5 = Cadence is sustainable; decisions are logged; velocity improves without status theater

## 6) Collaboration norms (conflict + credit)
1 = Conflict avoided or personal; credit hoarded  
3 = Some norms; inconsistently applied  
5 = Conflict protocol is usable; credit sharing is explicit and practiced

## Interpreting scores
- **26–30:** ship as-is
- **20–25:** ship with explicit assumptions + a short “unknowns” list
- **< 20:** do another intake round (max 5 questions) before finalizing
