# Cross-functional Collaboration

## Scope

**Covers**
- Leading a cross-functional initiative (Product/Engineering/Design/Data/Marketing/Ops/etc.)
- Turning “we’re misaligned” into explicit **goals, roles, decisions, and operating cadence**
- Reducing rework and conflict via **shared artifacts** (docs/prototypes) and clear decision rights
- Building trust through **conflict norms** and **credit/recognition** practices

**When to use**
- “We keep thrashing between PM/Eng/Design—set up a better way of working.”
- “Create a collaboration charter: roles, responsibilities, decision-making, and cadence.”
- “We need to work better with Engineering/Design/Data on <initiative>.”
- “Our cross-functional project is slow due to unclear ownership and decisions.”

**When NOT to use**
- You need to define the underlying product problem first (use `problem-definition`).
- You need a full decision process for a single high-stakes decision (use `running-decision-processes`).
- The issue is primarily a performance or accountability problem with an individual (use `having-difficult-conversations`).
- You only need a timeline/milestone plan (use `managing-timelines`).

## Inputs

**Minimum required**
- Initiative summary: what it is, why now, desired outcomes, and timeframe
- Functions/teams involved + key stakeholders (including any required subject matter experts)
- Current symptoms: where collaboration is breaking down (examples help)
- Constraints: deadlines, non-negotiables, policies/compliance, customer commitments

**Missing-info strategy**
- Ask up to 5 questions from [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md).
- If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Outputs (deliverables)

Produce a **Cross-Functional Collaboration Pack** (Markdown in-chat, or files if requested) in this order:
1) **Mission Charter** (goals, success metrics, scope, constraints, timeline)
2) **Stakeholder & Incentives Map** (owners, approvers, incentives/risks, comms needs)
3) **Roles & Expectations Contract** (responsibilities, expectations matrix, decision rights, escalation triggers)
4) **Operating Cadence & Communication Plan** (meetings, async updates, doc hub, comms to stakeholders)
5) **Decision Log (initial) + Decision Protocol** (what decisions are needed, who decides, how captured)
6) **Collaboration Norms** (conflict protocol + credit/recognition plan)
7) **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** (always included)

Templates: [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md)

## Workflow (7 steps)

### 1) Define the mission (and the collaboration mode)
- **Inputs:** Initiative summary; timeline; constraints.
- **Actions:** Clarify the mission, success metrics, and what “done” means. Name the collaboration mode (project/sprint vs ongoing interface) and the stakes (why this matters now).
- **Outputs:** Mission Charter (draft).
- **Checks:** A cross-functional partner can restate the mission, success metric(s), and constraints without you in the room.

### 2) Map the full cross-functional system (people + incentives)
- **Inputs:** Org context; teams/functions; known stakeholders.
- **Actions:** Identify owners, approvers, contributors, and informed stakeholders. Capture incentives, concerns, and “hidden constraints.” Ensure required subject matter experts are included.
- **Outputs:** Stakeholder & Incentives Map + “missing seats” list.
- **Checks:** No surprise approvers; every team that must execute or sign off is represented.

### 3) Make expectations explicit (write the contract)
- **Inputs:** Stakeholder map; friction examples.
- **Actions:** Run an expectations exercise (each function writes expectations of the others). Convert to a clear responsibilities map, decision rights, escalation triggers, and review cadence.
- **Outputs:** Roles & Expectations Contract (v1).
- **Checks:** Each function can answer: “What do I own? What do I expect of others? What decisions can I make?”

### 4) Establish a shared language via artifacts (prototype-first when helpful)
- **Inputs:** Initiative stage; ambiguity areas; tooling constraints.
- **Actions:** Choose the minimum set of shared artifacts (e.g., charter, spec/PRD, prototype, metrics definitions). Add an early “prototype or working slice” milestone when it reduces ambiguity.
- **Outputs:** Artifact plan + first prototype milestone (or “working slice” plan).
- **Checks:** At least one artifact concretely reduces ambiguity (fewer interpretation disputes).

### 5) Design the operating cadence (meetings, async, and decision logging)
- **Inputs:** Timeline; time zones; team size; existing rituals.
- **Actions:** Define the cadence, update format, doc hub, and channels. Install a decision log and a lightweight decision protocol (who decides, how disagreements resolve, where decisions live).
- **Outputs:** Operating Cadence & Communication Plan + Decision Log (seeded with first decisions).
- **Checks:** Cadence is sustainable and oriented to **outcomes, decisions, and risks** (not “status theater”).

### 6) Set norms for conflict and credit (trust mechanics)
- **Inputs:** Known tensions; cultural context; prior failure modes.
- **Actions:** Define a conflict protocol (including a “Yes, and” approach to reconcile valid competing goals). Define credit/recognition practices (who presents, how you share credit, how you recognize partner work).
- **Outputs:** Collaboration Norms (Conflict Protocol + Credit/Recognition Plan).
- **Checks:** Norms are specific enough to follow in a real disagreement and in exec/customer updates.

### 7) Quality gate + launch (and monitoring plan)
- **Inputs:** Draft pack.
- **Actions:** Run the checklist and rubric. Finalize the pack. Propose the first 1–2 “health checks” to update roles/cadence based on reality.
- **Outputs:** Final Pack + rubric score + Risks/Open questions/Next steps.
- **Checks:** If rubric score is low, do one more intake round (max 5 questions) and revise.

## Quality gate (required)
- Run [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and score with [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md) before finalizing.
- Always include: **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**.

## Examples

**Example 1:** “I’m leading a cross-functional onboarding revamp across Product/Eng/Design/Data. Create a Collaboration Pack with roles, cadence, and a decision log.”  
Expected: mission charter, stakeholder map, expectations contract, operating cadence, decision protocol/log, conflict + credit norms.

**Example 2:** “I’m an Engineering Manager partnering with PM+Design on a platform migration. Our decisions are slow and we keep re-litigating scope—create a Collaboration Pack.”  
Expected: decision rights/escalation triggers, seeded decision log, prototype/working-slice plan, and a lightweight cadence.

**Boundary example:** “Help me convince another team to do what I want.”  
Response: this skill aligns on shared goals/constraints and decision rights; if you need a one-way persuasion narrative or exec escalation, clarify the decision and use `running-decision-processes` or `managing-up`.
