# Sales Compensation — Intake (Question Bank)

Ask up to **5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## A) Company + GTM context
1) Company stage (seed/Series A/...) and GTM motion (inbound/outbound/PLG/enterprise)?
2) What do you sell (product), to whom (ICP), and at what price (typical ACV/ARR)?
3) Typical sales cycle length and who is involved in the buying committee?
4) What is your current baseline (if any): win rate, average discount, ramp time, churn/NRR?

## B) Roles in scope
5) Which roles are you designing comp for (SDR/BDR, AE, AM, CSM with expansion, SE overlay)?
6) For each role: what is their primary job (pipeline creation vs closing vs expansion vs renewal)?
7) Any split credit situations (SDR + AE, AE + AM, overlay/SE, channel partners)?

## C) What gets paid on (metrics)
8) What is the primary business goal: bookings, revenue, gross margin, retention/NRR, pipeline, or a mix?
9) What events can you reliably measure in your systems (CRM + billing): closed-won date, activation date, invoice paid, churn date, renewals?
10) What’s your preferred measurement window (monthly/quarterly/annual) and “quality” window (e.g., 90-day retention)?

## D) Economics + constraints
11) What gross margin range do you need to protect (or major COGS drivers)?
12) What is the comp budget constraint (e.g., “sales comp <= X% of ARR”) or runway constraint?
13) What’s your risk tolerance: are you okay paying more for over-performance (strong accelerators)?
14) Any discounting rules or approval thresholds today?

## E) OTE + pay mix preferences
15) Do you have market benchmarks or candidate expectations for OTE/base?
16) Do you want a “standard” mix (e.g., ~50/50 for AEs) or a different philosophy (higher base / lower variable)?
17) Any pay equity concerns, internal leveling, or geography adjustments?

## F) Quota + ramp
18) What time-to-productivity do you expect (e.g., 3–6 months)? Any historical ramp data?
19) What pipeline generation assumptions will be true (marketing demand, outbound capacity, PLG hand-raisers)?
20) Do you want draws/guarantees during ramp? If yes, what’s the maximum duration?

## G) Retention alignment (optional but recommended)
21) Is early churn a problem (first 30/60/90 days)? What are common churn reasons?
22) Who influences retention most: AE, CSM, product, implementation?
23) What retention metric matters most: logo retention, gross revenue retention, NRR, payback period?

## H) Administration + rollout
24) Who will administer payouts (Sales Ops/Finance)? How automated does it need to be?
25) Do you need rep-facing comms + FAQ and a change-control process?
