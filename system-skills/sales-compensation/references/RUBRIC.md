# Sales Compensation — Rubric (Score 1–5)

Score each dimension from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Aim for **≥ 4** on every dimension before rollout.

## 1) Clarity + simplicity
1: Metric definitions are ambiguous; lots of special cases.  
3: Mostly clear, but requires interpretation; too many exceptions.  
5: One-page explainable; unambiguous definitions; minimal exceptions.

## 2) Role controllability
1: Reps are paid/penalized on outcomes they can’t influence.  
3: Mixed controllability; some misaligned metrics remain.  
5: Metrics match role responsibilities and controllability.

## 3) Incentive alignment (anti-gaming)
1: Strong incentives to discount, stuff pipeline, or close bad-fit churny deals.  
3: Some guardrails exist but loopholes remain.  
5: Clear guardrails; common gaming behaviors are neutralized.

## 4) Economic viability
1: Plan is likely unaffordable or unpredictable at high attainment.  
3: Roughly viable but not stress-tested; accelerators risky.  
5: Stress-tested under scenarios; accelerators are intentional and affordable.

## 5) Ramp realism
1: Quotas/ramp are unrealistic; early reps fail by design.  
3: Ramp exists but not tied to actual productivity drivers.  
5: Ramp matches time-to-productivity and enables on-target earnings.

## 6) Retention/quality alignment
1: Pays for bookings regardless of churn/quality; misaligns with customer outcomes.  
3: Mentions quality but weak/unclear mechanisms.  
5: Clear retention-alignment method that is fair, measurable, and operable.

## 7) Operability + governance
1: Payouts require manual work and constant exceptions.  
3: Admin mostly possible but brittle; disputes likely.  
5: CRM/billing fields defined; payout process clear; dispute + change control defined.

## Decision rule
- **Ship** if all dimensions score **≥ 4** and no “red flag” risks remain.
- **Revise** if any dimension scores **≤ 3**; prioritize simplicity and operability first.
