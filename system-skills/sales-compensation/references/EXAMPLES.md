# Examples

**Example 1 (first AE comp plan, seed-stage SaaS):**  
“Use `sales-compensation`. We’re seed-stage B2B SaaS, $12k ACV, 45-day cycle. Hiring first 2 AEs. Goal: $600k ARR this year. Output: a Sales Comp Plan Pack with OTE/pay mix, quotas+ramp, commission mechanics, and a rep-facing FAQ.”

**Example 2 (retention-aligned comp, churn problem):**  
“Use `sales-compensation`. Reps optimize for bookings and we churn in the first 90 days. We want comp to reflect retention/NRR without being overly complex. Output: a Sales Comp Plan Pack with a retention-alignment addendum and clear admin rules.”

**Boundary example:**  
“Write a legally binding compensation agreement for California employees and tell me what’s compliant.”  
Response: explain this skill produces a comp-plan spec and rep-facing materials, but legal/compliance review must be done by qualified counsel.
