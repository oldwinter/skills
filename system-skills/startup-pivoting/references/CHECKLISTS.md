# Checklists (Startup Pivoting)

Use these before finalizing.

## A) Input readiness checklist
- Decision is explicit and time-bounded (owner + date).
- Runway/timebox is stated.
- Current product + persona + promise are stated.
- Evidence is listed (numbers or qualitative); gaps are labeled.
- Non-negotiables/constraints are stated.

## B) Exhaustion check checklist (Butterfield rule)
- “Last best” non-pivot levers are listed (or explicitly ruled out with reasons).
- Non-pivot attempts are judged on *quality of attempt*, not just “we tried”.
- Any recommended non-pivot move is time-boxed with a measurable target.
- If recommending pivot, rationale ties to runway and low expected value of remaining levers.

## C) Pivot options quality checklist
- 4–8 options exist and are meaningfully distinct.
- At least one option is classified as a 200% pivot.
- Each option includes: why it could win, what must be true, and biggest risks.
- Options include a plausible distribution wedge (how you reach customers).

## D) Pivot thesis + metrics checklist
- Pivot thesis is written as a falsifiable belief statement (persona/problem/promise).
- North Star metric is defined and defensible.
- 2–5 leading indicators are specified with targets.
- Guardrails are listed (trust/safety/cost/retention quality).
- Kill criteria are explicit with dates and actions.

## E) Validation + execution plan checklist
- Validation includes at least one “hard truth” test (pre-sell/LOIs/pilot commitment/paid demand).
- Execution plan includes a cut list (what stops).
- Plan has owners, timeline, and decision gates.
- Rollback/exit plan is stated if results fail.

## F) Finalization checklist
- Pack includes: Risks / Open questions / Next steps.
- Memo is shareable async (no meeting required to understand it).
- Human checkpoint is reiterated (decision owner/date).
