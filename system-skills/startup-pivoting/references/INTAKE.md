# Intake (Startup Pivoting)

Answer what you can. If you can’t answer, say “unknown” and we’ll proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Fast intake (answer these first)
1) What is the product today (1–2 sentences) and who is it for (ICP/persona)?
2) What problem/job does it solve today? What is your current “promise” in one sentence?
3) What are the “stuck” symptoms? (e.g., low activation, low retention, no sales pipeline, long cycles, high churn)
4) What evidence do you have? Include any numbers you can share (activation, D7/D30 retention, churn, MRR, CAC, pipeline, NPS, usage).
5) Runway/timebox: how many months of runway (or decision deadline)? What’s the “drop-dead” date?

## Constraints and non-negotiables
6) What must remain true? (trust/safety/privacy, compliance, margins, platform constraints, brand, team size)
7) What are your unfair advantages? (distribution, brand, partnerships, expertise, data, community)

## What you’ve already tried (for the exhaustion check)
8) Top 3 changes you’ve tried recently (ICP, pricing, onboarding, features, positioning, distribution). What happened?
9) What are the 1–3 best remaining non-pivot levers you *haven’t* tried (or can’t try)?

## Pivot decision framing
10) What does a “successful pivot” mean in 8–12 weeks? (north star + leading indicators)
11) What are you willing to change? (problem, persona, product, positioning/package, pricing, channel)
12) Stakeholders: who makes the final decision and who must be aligned?

## Optional (deep dive)
- Customer segments you’ve sold to (with outcomes)
- Win/loss notes (why people buy vs don’t)
- Competitive/alternative behaviors (what customers do instead)
- Current unit economics (rough is fine): price, gross margin, sales cycle, support burden
