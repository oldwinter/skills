# Source summary (Refound/Lenny → Skill Pack)

## Source
- `sources/refound/raw/startup-pivoting/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill contained
Two core insights framed via quotes:
1) **Stewart Butterfield:** “Have you exhausted the possibilities?” — pivot decisions should be made with rational distance, not emotional attachment.
2) **Todd Jackson:** Many founders do a “10% pivot” when a “200% pivot” is required; the source mentions a “Four Ps” framework and tactical advice for executing a pivot.

## How this pack operationalizes those insights
- **Butterfield → Exhaustion Check:** The skill pack includes an explicit “Exhaustion Check” deliverable and checklist to ensure credible non-pivot levers are evaluated and time-boxed before pivoting.
- **Jackson → 10% vs 200% + pivot sprint:** The pack requires a pivot option set that includes at least one 200% pivot and produces a time-boxed validation + execution plan (“pivot sprint”) with decision gates.

## Notes / assumptions
- The source references “The Four Ps” but does not enumerate them. This pack uses a practical **4P pivot grid** (Problem, Persona, Product, Positioning/Package) as an operational decomposition rather than claiming an exact transcription of the original framework.
