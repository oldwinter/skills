# Rubric (Problem Definition Pack)

Score each category 0/1/2:
- 0 = missing / unclear
- 1 = present but incomplete
- 2 = clear, testable, decision-ready

Suggested passing bar: **>= 12/16**.

## 1) Clarity of problem (0–2)
- 1-liner is specific and solution-free
- Expanded statement explains impact and likely causes (as hypotheses)

## 2) Target segment + context (0–2)
- Primary segment is explicit and recruitable
- Situation/context is described (when/where/why it happens)

## 3) JTBD quality (0–2)
- Primary job + sub-jobs are coherent
- User success criteria are defined

## 4) Alternatives + differentiation (0–2)
- Alternatives include real workarounds (including analog/non-digital when relevant)
- Switching costs and “why switch” rationale are explicit

## 5) Evidence + assumptions (0–2)
- Known vs unknown is clear
- Top assumptions have tests and confidence levels

## 6) Metrics + guardrails (0–2)
- Outcome metric(s) and leading indicators are defined and measurable
- Guardrails prevent gaming or harm

## 7) Scope boundaries (0–2)
- In/out and non-goals are explicit
- Dependencies and constraints are captured

## 8) Prototype/learning plan (0–2)
- End state is visible (“see the end from the beginning”)
- Test plan is the fastest path to learning with clear success criteria
