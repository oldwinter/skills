# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → Skill Pack)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/problem-definition/SKILL.md`

## What was preserved
Key insights from the source were converted into executable rules and checks:

- **“Why use this vs the non-digital alternative?”** → Alternatives mapping requires at least one analog/non-digital baseline and a “why switch” check.
- **“Make it concrete fast (prototype).”** → Workflow includes a prototype/learning plan to de-risk the hardest assumptions early.
- **“Avoid the shiny object trap (AI for AI’s sake).”** → Inputs and checklist require the pain point first; tech choice is treated as implementation detail.
- **“Don’t over-invest in problem validation if it’s obvious; win via solution.”** → Evidence log captures what’s already known and focuses learning on the uncertain parts that change decisions.
- **“See the end from the beginning.”** → Workflow requires an end-state description before committing to delivery.

## Notes / limitations
- The source references “guest insights” content that is not present in the repo; this pack was derived from the visible top insights only.
