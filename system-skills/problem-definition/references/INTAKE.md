# Intake (Problem Definition)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and list the **Open questions** that would change the decision.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What’s the product and target user/segment?** Who feels the pain most?
2) **What triggered this now?** (data trend, customer quotes, sales feedback, exec request, competitor move)
3) **What decision are we trying to make, and by when?** (invest/pause/stop; choose problem focus; greenlight discovery)
4) **What does the user do today instead?** Include workarounds, incumbents, and any analog/non-digital alternative.
5) **What constraints must we respect?** (privacy, compliance, latency, platform, budget, timeline, capacity)

## Evidence (as needed)
- What evidence do we already have? (links to dashboards, funnel data, tickets, churn notes, interview snippets)
- What’s the size of the issue? (frequency, affected segment size, revenue/support impact, severity)
- What are the leading hypotheses for root cause? What evidence supports/contradicts each?

## JTBD clarity (optional)
- What is the user trying to accomplish in the moment? What “job” are they hiring a solution for?
- What are the main sub-jobs and success criteria from the user’s perspective?
- What happens if the user fails to complete the job? (cost, risk, emotional impact)

## Success + guardrails (optional)
- How will we measure success if we solve this? (outcome metric + leading indicators)
- What must not get worse? (quality, trust, margin, fraud, support load, latency)

## If the request is “do AI”
- What user pain point would exist **even without AI**?
- What would a non-AI solution look like? Why isn’t it good enough?
- What are the failure modes and guardrails (privacy, hallucinations, unsafe advice, bias)?

## If the user can’t answer
Proceed with:
- A clear **Context snapshot** stating assumptions
- 2–3 plausible **segment + job** hypotheses
- An **alternatives map** with at least one analog/non-digital option
- An **evidence & assumptions log** with confidence levels + proposed tests
- A short list of **open questions** that would change the decision
