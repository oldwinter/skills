# Rubric — Partnership & BD Execution Pack

Score each dimension from **1 (weak)** to **5 (excellent)**. Use the gaps to drive iteration.

## 1) Objective clarity (1–5)
1 = “do partnerships” with no metric or date  
3 = metric exists but scope/non-goals are fuzzy  
5 = objective, metric, time box, and non-goals are crisp

## 2) Partner fit + prioritization (1–5)
1 = unranked list; no decision-maker mapping  
3 = shortlist exists but scoring is subjective  
5 = scoring model + shortlist + clear next actions + decision-maker hypotheses

## 3) Value exchange strength (1–5)
1 = vague “synergies”; unclear why partner cares  
3 = value exchange exists but proof is thin  
5 = partner-specific incentive alignment + credible proof + low-friction ask

## 4) Scalability + internal readiness (1–5)
1 = bespoke promises; unclear engineering constraints  
3 = tiers exist but exceptions are not controlled  
5 = offer tiers + guardrails + negotiation parameters + owners are explicit

## 5) Deal process + negotiation readiness (1–5)
1 = “let’s chat” with no path to close  
3 = deal path exists but walk-away/exclusivity unclear  
5 = MAP + pilot criteria + walk-away + human checkpoints are explicit

## 6) Execution plan + operating cadence (1–5)
1 = no outreach plan; no tracking loop  
3 = outreach exists but cadence/metrics vague  
5 = 2–4 week plan + tracking + launch plan + cadence (sync/QBR) is concrete

## 7) Risk handling + transparency (1–5)
1 = ignores compliance, reputational risk, or assumptions  
3 = risks listed but mitigations unclear  
5 = risks + mitigations + open questions + next steps are actionable

## Interpreting the score
- **30–35:** ready to run this week
- **22–29:** run, but expect iteration (identify top 1–2 gaps)
- **<22:** narrow scope; fix objective/targeting/offer first
