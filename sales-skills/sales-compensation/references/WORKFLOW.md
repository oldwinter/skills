# Sales Compensation — Workflow Notes

This file expands `../SKILL.md` with practical guidance, defaults, and common pitfalls.

## Workflow at a glance (7 steps)
1) Intake + plan boundaries
2) Role responsibilities + “what gets paid on”
3) OTE + base/variable mix
4) Quota + ramp model
5) Commission mechanics
6) Retention/quality alignment
7) Quality gate + finalize

## Default assumptions (use only if missing)
- Prefer **one primary metric per role** (simplicity beats precision).
- Start with a familiar pay mix unless you have a strong reason to change it:
  - Many full-cycle AE plans often resemble **~50/50 base/variable**.
  - Many SDR/BDR plans often skew **higher base / lower variable** than AEs.
- Measurement cadence: quotas and accelerators are easiest to run **quarterly** with **monthly** payouts.
- Avoid “needle-threading” metrics that reps can’t influence (e.g., long-term renewals for roles that don’t touch onboarding).

## Guidance by step

### 1) Intake + plan boundaries
- Write down: (a) desired behaviors, (b) unwanted behaviors, (c) time horizon (bookings vs retention).
- Decide who owns the final decision: CRO/Head of Sales + Finance + CEO (and Legal/HR review).

### 2) Role responsibilities + what gets paid on
Pick metrics that match the job:
- SDR/BDR: qualified meetings, opportunities created, pipeline quality (avoid incentivizing spam).
- AE (new business): closed-won bookings (ARR) with guardrails for discounting and quality.
- AM/CSM (expansion): expansion ARR, renewals, NRR (if they truly influence it).

**Crediting rules** (make these explicit):
- “When does it count?” (contract signed, invoice paid, activated?)
- “Who gets credit?” (splits, overlays, channels)
- “What happens when it cancels?” (chargeback/clawback timing)

### 3) OTE + pay mix
Heuristics to consider (not universal rules):
- Longer cycles and higher complexity often justify **higher base** (rep has less short-term controllability).
- Early-stage, unproven motions often require paying for learning and coverage (avoid starvation comp).
- Variable should be large enough to matter, but not so large that reps take unethical risks.

### 4) Quota + ramp
Quota methods:
- **Top-down:** Start from company targets and allocate by headcount/segments.
- **Bottom-up:** Start from ACV × win rate × capacity (meetings → opps → wins).
Use both and reconcile.

Ramp:
- Define ramp as a table (Month 1/2/3/4...) with quota attainment expectations.
- If you offer a draw/guarantee, specify duration and repayment rules.

### 5) Commission mechanics
Common failure modes to guard against:
- Discounting to hit quota (add discount-based adjustments or approvals).
- End-of-quarter gaming (define “substantial completion” and order dates).
- Manual exceptions (keep a defined exceptions process and a single owner).

If you add accelerators:
- Tie them to **attainment bands** (e.g., 100–125%, 125–150%) so payouts are predictable.
- Avoid caps unless you have a legal/market reason; instead protect economics via quota/rate design.

### 6) Retention/quality alignment options
Choose one (keep it simple):
1) **Holdback:** pay X% at booking, remaining Y% after 60–90 day retention.
2) **Chargeback window:** if churn happens within N days, recover/offset commission.
3) **Collected revenue:** pay on cash collected (simplifies quality but affects rep cashflow).
4) **NRR multiplier:** pay bookings commission × multiplier based on cohort retention/NRR (needs good data).

Check “influence fairness”:
- Don’t punish reps for churn driven by product gaps or failed onboarding if they can’t affect it.
- If retention is cross-functional, consider a **team component** or aligning CSM/implementation incentives too.

### 7) Quality gate + finalize
- The plan must be explainable in a single page.
- Ensure Finance/Sales Ops can calculate payouts from defined CRM/billing fields.
- Publish a rep-facing FAQ and an exceptions/disputes process before rollout.
