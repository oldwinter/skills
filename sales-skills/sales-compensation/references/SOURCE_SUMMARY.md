# Source Summary — Sales Compensation (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/sales-compensation/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill contained
The source skill was insight-heavy and minimal, with two core ideas:

1) A common default for many sales roles is a familiar OTE split (often discussed as **~50/50 base/variable**).
2) Standard comp plans often misalign incentives; a “modern” plan should better align the business, the customer, and the rep—especially around **retention** and long-term value.

## Key preserved snippets (short excerpts)
- Jason Lemkin: “It’s usually 50/50… 50% base, 50% bonus…”
- Sahil Mansuri: “Sales comp plans are stuck in the stone ages…”

## How this skill pack transformed the source
The source did not include an executable method or artifacts. This pack:
- Turns the insights into a concrete **execution contract** (inputs/outputs/workflow)
- Produces a **Sales Comp Plan Pack** with templates (one-pager, full spec, quota/ramp, calculator, rollout FAQ)
- Adds quality gates (checklists + rubric) and a retention-alignment decision framework
