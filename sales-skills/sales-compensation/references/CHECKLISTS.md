# Sales Compensation — Checklists

Use these checklists before finalizing a plan.

## 1) Scope + clarity checklist
- The plan clearly states which roles are covered and which are not.
- The primary metric(s) are defined in plain language and are measurable from systems of record.
- Crediting rules are explicit (who gets paid, when, and on what).
- The plan can be explained in **one page** without footnote-heavy exceptions.

## 2) Incentive alignment checklist (DO / DO NOT)
- The plan rewards the behaviors you actually want (e.g., qualified pipeline, high-quality closes, healthy expansion).
- The plan discourages predictable gaming (discounting, bad-fit deals, end-of-quarter stuffing).
- Metrics are controllable by the role (avoid punishing reps for outcomes they can’t influence).
- There is at most **one primary metric per role** (simplicity).

## 3) Economics + finance checklist
- The plan is viable under low/base/high scenarios (quota × rate × attainment distribution).
- Accelerators are affordable at high attainment (no “bankrupt the company” tail risk).
- Discount/margin guardrails exist if discounting can destroy unit economics.
- Payout timing matches cash/revenue realities (and is clearly communicated).

## 4) Ramp + fairness checklist
- Ramp schedule is defined and matches expected time-to-productivity.
- Draw/guarantee (if used) has clear rules (duration, repayment, eligibility).
- Splits and handoffs are fair and don’t create internal conflict loops.
- Edge cases are addressed (leave, territory changes, plan changes mid-period).

## 5) Retention/quality alignment checklist
- A retention-alignment method is chosen only if you have the data to administer it.
- The retention window is explicit (e.g., 60/90 days) and dispute handling is defined.
- The method is proportional to rep influence (don’t over-penalize for product/onboarding issues).

## 6) Operability + governance checklist
- Required CRM/billing fields are listed and owned.
- Payouts can be calculated without manual judgment calls.
- Disputes/exceptions process exists with a single owner and deadlines.
- Change control is defined (how/when plans can change; how reps are notified).
