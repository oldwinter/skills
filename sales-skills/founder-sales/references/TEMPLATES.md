# Founder Sales — Templates (copy/paste)

## 2) ICP wedge + Founder POV one-pager

**Impact:** (time/$/risk)  
**Exclusion criteria (not for):**  

### Founder POV (problem-first narrative)
**What’s changing / why now:**

**The cost of doing nothing:**  
**Your insight (why you see it):**  
**What you do differently (no features list):**

## 3) Target list table (starter list)

Create a list of **25–100** accounts/people to start, then prioritize to the first **25**.

| Target | Segment fit (H/M/L) | Trigger signal | Hypothesis (pain) | Contact | Warm path | Next action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## 4) Outreach kit

### A) Warm intro ask (to a connector)
Subject: Quick intro to <buyer name/role>?

Hi <Name> — quick ask. I’m working on <1-line product> for <ICP>.  
I’m trying to speak with a few <titles> who are dealing with <pain>.

Would you be comfortable introducing me to <Person/Company> for a 20-minute diagnostic chat?  
If helpful, here’s a 2-sentence forwardable blurb:

> <Founder> is building <what> for <who>. They’ve been talking to <peers> and keep seeing <problem>. Could we do a quick 20-min chat to compare notes?

Thanks — <Name>

### B) Cold outreach (email/LinkedIn)
Subject: Quick question about <trigger/pain> at <company>

Hi <Name> — I’m reaching out because I’ve been speaking with <peers in their space> and a pattern keeps coming up:
<1 sentence about problem in their language>.

Curious if this is true for you at <Company>:
- <diagnostic question #1>
- <diagnostic question #2>

If it’s relevant, I’d love to do a 20-minute diagnostic chat. If not, I’ll get out of your hair.

— <Founder name>

### C) Follow-ups (pick 2–3)
**Follow-up #1 (2–3 days):**  
Quick bump — is <problem> on your radar this quarter, or is it a non-issue at <Company>?

**Follow-up #2 (value nugget):**  
One thing we’ve learned talking to <peers>: <short insight>. Does that match what you’re seeing?

**Follow-up #3 (breakup):**  
No worries if now isn’t the right time. If it becomes urgent later, want me to send a 1-page diagnostic checklist?

## 5) Diagnostic discovery kit (no demo first)

### Call agenda (20–30 minutes)
1) Context + purpose (2 min)  
2) Their current workflow + pain (10–15 min)  
3) Impact + “why now” trigger (5–8 min)  
4) What a good outcome looks like (3–5 min)  
5) Next steps (2–3 min)

### Opener (laptop closed)
“We’ve been talking to a few <peer companies> and we keep seeing <problem>. I’m not here to demo—mostly to understand whether this is real for you and how you handle it today. Does that sound okay?”

### Question bank
- What kicked this off? Why is this a priority now (or not)?
- Walk me through how you do <workflow> today.
- Where does it break? What happens when it breaks?
- How are you measuring success right now?
- What have you tried already? Why didn’t it work?
- What’s the impact (time, dollars, risk, missed goals)?
- Who else is involved if you change this? Who needs to sign off?
- If you did nothing for 6 months, what happens?

### Next step close (choose one)
- “If we could show you <specific outcome>, would it be worth a short pilot?”  
- “Should we do a second call with <role> to validate the workflow and success criteria?”  
- “Want me to send a 1-page decision guide and a proposed pilot plan?”
