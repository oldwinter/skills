# Templates — Building Sales Team

Copy/paste the sections you need. The default deliverable is a single “Sales Team Build Pack” document that contains each template filled in.

## 1) Context snapshot (brief)
```md
# Sales Team Build Pack — <Company/Product>

## Context snapshot
- Stage: <pre-seed/seed/Series A+>
- GTM motion: <PLG/inbound/outbound/enterprise>
- ICP: <buyer/user + firmographics>
- Product complexity: <low/medium/high; who needs to be convinced>
- Pricing/ACV: <...>
- Sales cycle: <...>
- Current resources: <founder time, CS/support, marketing demand, tooling>
- Constraints: <budget/headcount/timeline/geo>
- 90-day target: <pipeline/bookings/revenue/learning milestones>

## Assumptions & unknowns
- <assumption 1>
- <unknown 1 + how we’ll resolve it>
```

## 2) Readiness gate (hire now vs wait)
```md
## Readiness gate

### Current baseline (best available)
- At-bats measured as: <definition>
- Last 60–90 days:
  - First meetings: <#>
  - Closed-won: <#>
  - Closed-lost: <#>
  - Win rate (first meeting → closed-won): <#%>
  - Typical ACV: <$>
  - Typical cycle length: <days/weeks>
- Top win reasons: <1–3 bullets>
- Top loss reasons: <1–3 bullets>

### Decision
Choose one:
- ✅ **Hire now (pilot)** because: <evidence>  
  We will measure in 30 days: <metrics>
- ⛔ **Wait** because: <evidence>  
  Milestones to hit before hiring: <3–5 measurable milestones>

### Notes (anti-pitfalls)
- Avoid hiring as a substitute for figuring out ICP/messaging.
- If wins are mostly relationships/favors, treat baseline as low-confidence.
```

## 3) Sales motion spec (1-pager)
```md
## Sales motion spec (what we’re hiring into)

### ICP + qualification
- In-scope: <...>
- Out-of-scope: <...>
- Must-have trigger events: <...>

### First meeting (discovery-first)
- Objective: <...>
- Agenda: <...>
- Qualification signals: <...>

### Demo / pilot / trial criteria
- When we demo: <...>
- When we propose a pilot: <...>
- Pilot success criteria (30 days): <...>

### Pricing/packaging guardrails
- Default offer: <...>
- Concessions allowed: <...>
- Concessions not allowed: <...>

### Sales stages + “at-bat” definition
- Stage 0: <...> (exit criteria)
- Stage 1: <...>
- Stage 2: <...>

### Objections + best current responses
- <objection> → <response>

### Responsibilities (next 60–90 days)
- Founder owns: <...>
- Rep owns: <...>
- CS/support owns: <...>
```

## 4) Team design + hiring sequence plan
```md
## Team design + hiring sequence

### Starting topology (pick one)
- PLG/hand-raisers pilot pod: <AE + SDR or hybrid> attached to founder
- Outbound sequence: <SDR → AE> (or hybrid first)
- Technical-heavy coverage plan: <founder/PM/SE coverage until dedicated SE>

### Hiring sequence (why this order)
| Role | Timing | Why now | Success criteria (30/60/90) | Key risks | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| <Role 1> | <date> | <...> | <...> | <...> | <...> |
| <Role 2> | <date> | <...> | <...> | <...> | <...> |

### “A/B test humans” plan (recommended)
- If feasible, hire **two reps** close together to avoid “one data point.”
- Define what “comparable” means: segment, lead source, territory, enablement, time.
- Decide what you’ll compare: conversion rates, sales cycle, deal size, qualification accuracy.
```

## 5) Role scorecard (repeat per role)
```md
## Role scorecard — <AE / SDR / Hybrid>

### Mission
<What this role exists to accomplish in the next 90 days>

### Outcomes (30/60/90)
- 30: <...>
- 60: <...>
- 90: <...>

### Must-have signals
- <signal> (how we’ll test it)
- <signal>

### Red flags
- <anti-signal>

### Product depth bar (for technical products)
- Can explain product like a PM (crisp, non-hand-wavy)
- Asks “engineer-grade” questions without posturing
- Builds trust with technical stakeholders quickly

### Practical tests (map to interview loop)
- Mock discovery: <...>
- Product deep-dive: <...>
- Written follow-up: <...>
```

## 6) Interview loop + score sheet
```md
## Interview loop — <Role>

### Stages
1) Recruiter screen (30 min)
2) Hiring manager interview (45 min)
3) Mock discovery (45 min)
4) Product deep-dive / “PM-like” interview (45 min)
5) Written follow-up (async, 30–60 min)
6) References (2 calls)

### Scorecard dimensions (1–5)
- Domain learning speed
- Diagnostic discovery (asks great questions)
- Product depth and credibility (esp. with engineers)
- Objection handling + next-step discipline
- Writing clarity (follow-up, recap, MAP mindset)
- Coachability (incorporates feedback)

### Debrief protocol
- Each interviewer submits scores + evidence before discussion.
- Decide with scorecard evidence; record “why yes / why no” for calibration.
```

## 7) Onboarding + 30/60/90 ramp plan
```md
## Onboarding + ramp plan — <Role>

### Pre-start (week 0)
- Access + tooling: <CRM, email, call recording, product env>
- Read/skim: motion spec, ICP sheet, pricing guardrails, case studies

### First 2 weeks (foundation)
- Shadowing plan: <calls to shadow + notes expectations>
- Product training: <modules>
- Discovery practice: <role plays + coaching>
- “Definition of done”: rep can run discovery and produce a crisp recap + next steps

### 30/60/90 targets (measurable)
- 30: activity + skill milestones (not only quota)
- 60: qualified pipeline created + pilots started
- 90: closed-won targets (or validated learning targets if still early)

### Coaching cadence (weekly)
- Pipeline review: <day/time>
- Call review: <day/time>
- Experiment review: <day/time> (what we tried, what we learned, what changes)

### Metrics to track
- First meeting → next step conversion
- Pilot/trial start rate
- Win rate (stage-by-stage)
- Cycle length
- Deal quality (ICP fit, churn risk signals)
```

## 8) Risks / open questions / next steps (required)
```md
## Risks
- <risk> (mitigation)

## Open questions
- <question> (how we’ll answer it)

## Next steps (this week)
1) <...>
2) <...>
```
