# Source Summary — building-sales-team (Refound/Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/building-sales-team/SKILL.md`

## What the original skill covered
The source skill is a small set of tactical insights on **when and how to build an early sales team**, including:
- Hiring timing (don’t hire too early; wait for repeatability)
- Using data/benchmarks to decide readiness (win rate and sufficient at-bats)
- Hiring for product depth in technical companies (sales that can “pass for PMs”)
- Starting with a small pilot pod for product-led sales (AE/SDR attached to founder)
- Hiring two reps early to create an A/B baseline (“A/B test humans”)

Note: The source references a deeper file (`references/guest-insights.md`) for additional guest quotes, but it was not present in `sources/refound/raw/building-sales-team/`.

## Top insights preserved and how they were transformed

1) **Hire two reps early to create a baseline (Jason M Lemkin)**  
Preserved as: workflow step 3 (“A/B test humans” plan) in `../SKILL.md`, plus checklist **C** and rubric category **3**.

2) **Don’t hire sales until the motion is repeatable (Jen Abel)**  
Preserved as: workflow step 1 (readiness gate and “hire now vs wait”) and checklist **A**.

3) **Technical sales should have PM-like product depth (Jeanne Grosser)**  
Preserved as: workflow step 4 (role scorecards with product depth bar) and checklist **D**.

4) **PLG → product-led sales should start as a pilot pod, not a quota machine (Elena Verna)**  
Preserved as: workflow step 3 (pilot AE/SDR attached to founder, learning-protected pilot) and checklist **A/C**.

5) **Hire first sales reps when founder has a repeatable win rate over many at-bats (Pete Kazanjy)**  
Preserved as: workflow step 1 readiness criteria (win rate + at-bat volume), plus templates in [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md).

## Notes on additions (manufactured execution layers)
The source is insight-heavy and does not provide a full, testable process. This skill pack adds:
- An explicit input/output contract
- A 7-step workflow with checks
- Copy/paste templates for readiness gating, motion spec, hiring plan, scorecards, interview loop, and ramp plan
- Quality gates (checklists + rubric) and required final sections (risks/questions/next steps)
