# Checklists — Building Sales Team

Use these checklists before finalizing the Sales Team Build Pack.

## A) Readiness gate (hire now vs wait)
- [ ] The current motion is stated (PLG/inbound/outbound/enterprise) and the ICP is explicit.
- [ ] Baseline funnel numbers are included (or clearly marked as unknown).
- [ ] A clear **hire-now vs wait** decision is made and tied to measurable criteria.
- [ ] If hiring now, the scope is sized as a **pilot** with learning time protected (not quota theater).
- [ ] If waiting, milestones are specific (e.g., # at-bats, win rate range, stable ICP, hand-raiser volume).

## B) Motion spec quality (teachability)
- [ ] “At-bat” is defined and stages have exit criteria.
- [ ] First meeting objective + agenda exists (diagnostic, not feature dump).
- [ ] Demo/pilot/trial criteria are explicit.
- [ ] Pricing/packaging guardrails are included (what can/can’t be offered).
- [ ] Founder vs rep vs CS/support responsibilities are clear for 60–90 days.

## C) Team design + hiring sequence
- [ ] The initial team topology matches the motion (PLG vs outbound vs enterprise).
- [ ] Hiring sequence is justified (why this role first, what bottleneck it resolves).
- [ ] If feasible, there is an “**A/B test humans**” plan (two reps or comparable cohorts).
- [ ] The plan avoids premature specialization (hybrid/pod first where appropriate).
- [ ] There is a plan for technical coverage (SE/founder/PM support) if needed.

## D) Hiring criteria (product depth + learning)
- [ ] Role scorecards define outcomes (30/60/90), must-have signals, and red flags.
- [ ] For technical products, the bar includes “PM-like” product thinking and engineer credibility.
- [ ] Signals are testable (each maps to an interview exercise or evidence source).

## E) Interview loop robustness
- [ ] Interview stages cover the full scorecard (discovery, product depth, writing, coachability).
- [ ] Practical exercises exist (mock discovery, product deep-dive, written follow-up).
- [ ] Scoring is structured (1–5) with evidence, and debrief protocol reduces gut-feel bias.

## F) Onboarding + management system
- [ ] A 30/60/90 ramp plan is present with measurable targets.
- [ ] Weekly cadence is defined (pipeline review, call coaching, experiment review).
- [ ] Metrics include both leading indicators and conversion/quality measures.
- [ ] There is an explicit plan to diagnose **process vs person** (learning loop + comparability).

## G) Final sections (required)
- [ ] Risks are listed with mitigations.
- [ ] Open questions are listed with how they’ll be answered.
- [ ] Next steps are executable within one week.
