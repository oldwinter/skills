# Rubric — Building Sales Team (Sales Team Build Pack)

Score each category **1–5**. Target: **≥ 24/35** with no category below **3**.

## 1) Readiness gate clarity
**1:** No hire/wait decision; vague rationale.  
**3:** Decision made with some metrics/assumptions; milestones exist.  
**5:** Decision is evidence-based, milestones are measurable, and the plan protects learning.

## 2) Sales motion spec (teachability)
**1:** “Sell the product” hand-waving; no stage definitions.  
**3:** Motion spec exists but has gaps (stages, pricing guardrails, responsibilities).  
**5:** Motion is written down with stage exit criteria, demo/pilot rules, and clear handoffs.

## 3) Team design + sequencing
**1:** Org chart without rationale; premature specialization.  
**3:** Reasonable sequence with some motion fit; limited comparability.  
**5:** Topology matches motion, sequencing is justified, and comparability/A-B baseline is planned.

## 4) Role scorecards (signals + tests)
**1:** Generic traits; not testable.  
**3:** Signals exist, some mapped to tests; technical depth bar is partial.  
**5:** Clear outcomes + must-have signals/red flags; every signal has a test; “PM-like” bar is explicit where needed.

## 5) Interview loop quality
**1:** Unstructured interviews; no practical exercises; no debrief protocol.  
**3:** Some structure and exercises; scoring inconsistently applied.  
**5:** Practical tests + structured scoring + evidence-based debrief; reference checks validate key signals.

## 6) Onboarding + ramp + cadence
**1:** “Shadow and figure it out”; no metrics.  
**3:** 30/60/90 exists with basic cadence; metrics incomplete.  
**5:** Ramp is measurable, cadence is scheduled, and there is a learning loop to diagnose process vs person.

## 7) Execution readiness (risks + next steps)
**1:** No risks/questions/next steps.  
**3:** Risks and next steps exist but are generic.  
**5:** Risks are mitigated, open questions have owners/answers, and next steps are executable this week.
