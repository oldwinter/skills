# coding-common-skills

## OVERVIEW
Curated, general-purpose development skills (small set). Each skill lives in its own directory and is anchored by `SKILL.md`.

## WHERE TO LOOK
| Task | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| See which skills exist | `coding-common-skills/*/SKILL.md` | Names are the directory names.
| Deep rules/examples | `coding-common-skills/*/rules/` or `references/` | Not all skills have both.

## CONVENTIONS
- Directory layout: `<skill>/SKILL.md` + optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `rules/`.
- Some skills may also exist under `system-skills/tools-skills/` (intentional duplication).

## ANTI-PATTERNS
- Don’t assume `coding-common-skills/` is the source-of-truth for a skill; `system-skills/` may be the canonical synced copy.
