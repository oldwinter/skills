# Rubric — Organizational Design (1–5)

Score the Organizational Design Pack before finalizing. Total score helps decide whether to proceed or do another intake round.

## 1) Optimization clarity + success metrics
1 = Vague goals; no metrics; “reorg because vibes”  
3 = Goals stated; some metrics/constraints unclear  
5 = Optimization target + metrics + constraints are explicit and testable

## 2) Current-state diagnosis (dependencies + decisions)
1 = Org chart only; little evidence for bottlenecks  
3 = Some dependencies/decision issues captured  
5 = Clear map of dependency hotspots + decision rights that explains delays/rework

## 3) Operating model fit (centralization + functional/divisional)
1 = Posture not stated; implicit assumptions  
3 = Posture stated; guardrails incomplete  
5 = Posture is explicit with guardrails tied to product coupling and execution needs

## 4) Option quality (comparability + tradeoffs)
1 = One option; no real tradeoffs  
3 = Multiple options; tradeoffs partially articulated  
5 = 2–3 viable options with clear pros/cons, assumptions, and dependency changes

## 5) Decision rights + operating mechanisms
1 = “Everyone owns it”; decisions still ambiguous  
3 = Some decision rights/cadence defined  
5 = Decision rights, escalation triggers, and cadence are concrete and adoptable on Day 1

## 6) Leadership/craft leverage (layers + roles)
1 = Layers unclear; managers as process-only coordinators  
3 = Roles named; some layer issues remain  
5 = Layers are simplified where needed; leadership roles support craft and outcomes; managers understand the work

## 7) Feasibility + transition safety
1 = Big-bang plan; continuity risks ignored  
3 = Transition plan exists; risk mitigations partial  
5 = Sequenced transition with comms, continuity plan, metrics, and rollback triggers

## Interpreting scores
- **29–35:** ship as-is
- **23–28:** ship with explicit assumptions + a short unknowns list
- **< 23:** do another intake round (max 5 questions) before finalizing
