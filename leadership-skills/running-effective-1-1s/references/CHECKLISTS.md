# Checklists (Quality Gates)

Use these checklists before finalizing the pack.

## A) Pack completeness (must pass)
- [ ] Includes a clear **purpose** for 1:1s and a “what goes where” map
- [ ] Includes a **cadence + meeting types plan** (directs + skip-levels as needed)
- [ ] Includes **shared 1:1 doc template** (agenda, notes, action items, topics backlog)
- [ ] Includes a **coaching toolkit** (rules + questions + when to be directive)
- [ ] Includes a **career conversation plan** (life story → dreams → action plan)
- [ ] Includes a **wellbeing/recovery check-in** pattern with boundaries/escalation
- [ ] Includes **special-situation playbooks** (post-crisis listening; urgent topical; skip-level)
- [ ] Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**

## B) 1:1 system quality
- [ ] Status updates have a non-1:1 home (async or team ritual)
- [ ] Cadence matches relationship needs and reduces meeting bloat
- [ ] Each meeting ends with written next steps (owner + due date or checkpoint)
- [ ] The system is lightweight enough to maintain for 4–8 weeks

## C) Coaching quality
- [ ] Coaching prompts help the report generate options and tradeoffs
- [ ] The manager avoids “instant answers” by default
- [ ] Exceptions for directive leadership are explicit (risk/time/safety)

## D) Career development quality
- [ ] Career conversations are scheduled as dedicated sessions (not squeezed into 10 minutes)
- [ ] Output includes 1–3 growth bets with practice loops and checkpoints
- [ ] The plan ties growth to real work opportunities (projects, ownership, scope)

## E) Wellbeing + safety boundaries
- [ ] Joy/energy check-ins are present and respectful (no diagnosing)
- [ ] Workload/priority adjustments are considered when burnout risk appears
- [ ] Escalation guidance exists (company policy, professional resources)

## F) Skip-level + special sessions quality
- [ ] Skip-level purpose is clear and does not bypass the direct manager
- [ ] Notes handling is clear (themes, not quotes/names)
- [ ] Post-crisis session is listening-first and not a status meeting
