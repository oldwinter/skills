## Preserved insights → rules/checks

### 1) Shift from advisor to coach (Rachel Lockett)
- **Rule:** Default to coaching questions; do not provide the answer immediately.
- **Check:** The 1:1 system includes a coaching script and question bank, plus explicit “when to be directive” exceptions.

### 2) Make career conversations intentional (Kim Scott)
- **Rule:** Run three dedicated career conversations: Life Story, Future Dreams, Career Action Plan.
- **Check:** Each report leaves with 1–3 written growth bets and follow-up checkpoints.

### 3) Monitor recovery/joy (Hilary Gridley)
- **Rule:** Ask about joy/energy and treat persistent lack of joy as a risk that needs a plan.
- **Check:** The pack includes a lightweight wellbeing check-in template and boundaries/escalation guidance.

### 4) Reduce standing 1:1s; improve timeliness (Howie Liu)
- **Rule:** Avoid defaulting to many standing 1:1s; use a barbell approach (relationship catch-ups + urgent topical meetings).
- **Check:** Cadence plan includes what gets removed, what replaces it, and a fast-path for urgent topics.

### 5) In crisis, focus on feeling heard (Matt Mochary)
- **Rule:** After major change, run a listening-first session focused on thoughts/feelings rather than status updates.
- **Check:** The pack includes a post-crisis listening session template with a listening-heavy structure.
