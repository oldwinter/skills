# Intake (Question Bank) — Coaching PMs

Use this to gather the minimum information required to produce a PM Coaching Pack. Ask **3–5 questions at a time**.

## 1) Your context (the coach)
1) What’s your role and scope (PM manager, GPM, Director/Head of Product, tech lead coaching a PM)?
2) What’s the product/company stage and team shape (0→1, growth, enterprise, platform)? Any constraints (time, org, compliance)?
3) What’s your coaching goal for this cycle (4–12 weeks)?

## 2) The PM being coached
4) What’s their level/title and scope (surface area, autonomy, decision rights)?
5) Tenure and background (new to company, new to PM, domain expertise)?
6) What are 2–3 strengths you want to preserve/compound?

## 3) Current state + evidence
7) What’s not working? Share 2–5 anonymized examples (missed decisions, unclear PRD, stakeholder conflict, weak strategy).
8) What artifacts exist we can use (PRDs, roadmaps, decision docs, launch plans, postmortems)?
9) Any feedback themes from peers/eng/design/leadership? (High-level, no sensitive personal data.)

## 4) Definition of “good PM” (in your context)
10) Do you already have a PM ladder/competencies/values? If yes, share a summary.
11) What does “excellent” look like for this PM’s role in the next 6–12 months?
12) What are the non-negotiables (communication norms, quality bar, operating cadence, principles)?

## 5) Goals + constraints
13) What business outcomes matter most this quarter (activation, revenue, retention, reliability, cost)?
14) What constraints are real (authority gaps, unclear mandate, missing data, resourcing, dependencies)?
15) Any timeline anchors (performance cycle, promotion packet deadline, launch date)?

## 6) Coaching logistics
16) What cadence is realistic (weekly/biweekly 1:1s, async doc reviews)?
17) Preferred tooling for shared docs (Google Docs/Notion/Confluence) and tracking (Jira/Asana)?
