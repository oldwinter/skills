# Checklists — Coaching PMs

Use these checklists before finalizing the PM Coaching Pack and during execution.

## A) PM Coaching Pack quality checklist (pre-flight)
- Includes a clear boundary: coaching vs HR/performance management.
- Defines “good PM” in-context with observable behaviors (not vague traits).
- Uses Bloom depth ladder (or another explicit leveling method) to describe skill depth.
- Assessment is evidence-based (artifacts/examples cited) and separates skill vs constraints.
- Chooses 1–3 growth bets with clear success signals and timeframe.
- Development plan contains weekly reps + stretch work + required artifacts.
- Coaching cadence is sustainable and includes artifact review points.
- Includes a follow-up tracker + review checkpoints.
- Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.

## B) Evidence quality checklist
- Each gap claim has at least 1 concrete example.
- Evidence references decisions/artifacts, not personality judgments.
- Uncertainty is labeled (where evidence is thin).

## C) Coaching (not rescuing) checklist
- I asked for options + tradeoffs before giving answers.
- Feedback is criteria-based (“quality bar/constraint/impact”), not “do it my way”.
- I’m building independent reasoning, not creating dependency on me.

## D) Follow-up checklist (monthly review)
- We updated the assessment using new evidence.
- We kept/changed growth bets based on constraints and results.
- We celebrated visible progress and increased autonomy where appropriate.
