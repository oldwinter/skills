# Examples — Delegating Work

## Example 1 — Delegating a cross-functional project (PM)
**Scenario:** Delegate “Improve onboarding activation” to a PM in 6 weeks.

**Good output includes:**
- Delegation brief with activation metric definition + constraints
- Decision rights: PM decides research approach; escalates scope changes and timeline slips > 1 week
- Context pack: current funnel, prior experiments, key stakeholders (Growth, Eng, Design)
- Cadence: weekly review of a short doc; mid-week async update
- Review plan: manager reviews artifacts (experiment plan + learning memo) against criteria

## Example 2 — Delegating a risky technical change (Eng)
**Scenario:** Delegate “Migrate service to new infra” to an engineer; high reliability bar.

**Good output includes:**
- Guardrails: no customer-visible downtime; rollback plan required; security review trigger
- Review points: design review + pre-launch checklist review
- Cadence: 2x weekly check-ins early, then weekly

## Boundary example — Too vague
**Scenario:** “Delegate ‘make our roadmap better.’”

**Better response:**
- Ask for the decision and artifacts: “Do you want a prioritized roadmap, an OKR set, or a vision narrative?”
- Time box and stakeholders
- Then produce a Delegation Pack for the chosen artifact
