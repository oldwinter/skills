# Checklists — Delegating Work

Use these checklists before finalizing the Delegation Pack and at key moments during execution.

## A) Delegation Pack quality checklist (pre-flight)
- Outcome/definition of done is explicit and testable.
- “Why now” context is included (so the owner can make tradeoffs).
- Non-negotiables are listed (timeline, quality, policy/security, customer impact).
- Autonomy level is explicit (recommend vs decide-with-guardrails vs fully own).
- Decision rights are clear (owner decisions vs manager decisions).
- Escalation triggers are specific thresholds (not vibes).
- Context handoff includes prior decisions + rationale + known pitfalls.
- Cadence focuses on outcomes/risks/decisions (not task micromanagement).
- Review points are artifact-based and scheduled.
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps are included.

## B) “Context, not control” checklist (anti-micromanagement)
- I communicated the **why**, constraints, and success criteria—not a task list.
- I asked for options/tradeoffs before giving an answer.
- When I gave feedback, I stated a criterion/constraint, not “do it my way.”
- I let the owner struggle with the *right* problems without rescuing.

## C) Mid-flight check-in checklist
- Progress is tracked against the outcome and milestones.
- The owner has named the top 1–3 current risks and mitigations.
- Any decision needed is clearly framed with options + tradeoffs.
- If an escalation trigger fired, we addressed it quickly and updated guardrails.

## D) Close-out checklist (debrief)
- Deliverable meets acceptance criteria and guardrails.
- Ownership is durable (maintenance/next iteration is assigned).
- Learnings are captured and at least one template/guardrail is improved.
