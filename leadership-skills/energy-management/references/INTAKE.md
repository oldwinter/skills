# Intake (Energy Management)

Ask **up to 5 questions at a time**. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Minimum intake (pick the best 5)
1) **What’s your role and scope?** Do you manage people? What are your top 3 responsibilities right now?
2) **What does “better energy” mean in 4–8 weeks?** (e.g., fewer crashes, more deep work, end the week with energy, less dread)
3) **What are your top drains and top drivers today?** Give 2–3 examples of each (specific activities/meetings/people/context).
4) **What does a representative week look like?** Recurring meetings, deep work, 1:1s, travel/on-call, time zones.
5) **What constraints are non-negotiable?** Deadlines, “can’t move” meetings, caregiving hours, health accommodations (no details needed), policies.

## Context (as needed)
- What’s your **energy curve** most days? (high/medium/low windows)
- Which tasks require your best thinking? Which can be done in low-energy time?
- Where do you feel the most fragmentation? (context switching, Slack pings, meeting clusters)
- Any “invisible work” you’re carrying? (emotional labor, approvals, coordination)

## Stakeholders + leverage (optional but useful)
- Who can help you remove drains? (EA, manager, peers, direct reports)
- What can be delegated immediately? What needs guardrails?
- Which meetings are political/non-optional vs truly optional?

## If the user can’t answer (fallback)
Proceed with:
- A **7-day energy log** template + instructions (track “energized vs sapped” after key interactions)
- A conservative default-week plan: meeting batching, buffers, shorter meeting defaults, and one deep-work block
- A list of unknowns and the **next 5 questions** to answer during week 1
