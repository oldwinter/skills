# Checklists (Quality Gates) — Energy Management

Use these checklists before finalizing the pack.

## A) Pack completeness (must pass)
- [ ] Includes a clear **4–8 week success definition** and a **2-week pilot**
- [ ] Includes an **Energy Drivers & Drains Map** with specific levers and next actions
- [ ] Includes a **Calendar Energy Audit** with time buckets and “top offenders”
- [ ] Includes a **Zone of Genius Expansion Plan** (stop/delegate/automate/defer) with owners
- [ ] Includes an **Energy-Aligned Default Week** (time blocks aligned to energy)
- [ ] Includes **Meeting Rules** (agenda/decision owner, shorter defaults, async-first, buffers)
- [ ] Includes a **Recovery + Transition Plan** and a **Low-Energy-Day Protocol**
- [ ] Includes a **2-week experiment tracker** with measures and decision rules
- [ ] Includes **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**

## B) Actionability + realism
- [ ] Top 3 changes are scheduled (not just suggested)
- [ ] The plan removes/redesigns at least **2** recurring drains in the next 2 weeks
- [ ] Delegation items include guardrails/escalation triggers (not vague handoffs)
- [ ] Calendar design assumes real constraints (“can’t move” meetings are handled)

## C) Energy-quality (not time-only)
- [ ] The plan explicitly reduces **context switching** and **decision fatigue**
- [ ] High-load work has buffers and transitions (no back-to-back “hard” meetings)
- [ ] Recovery actions are framed as system design, not moralizing

## D) Measurement + iteration
- [ ] Measures are lightweight and attributable (2–4 experiments max)
- [ ] Each experiment has a clear decision rule: keep / modify / stop after 2 weeks
- [ ] Next-step schedule exists (pilot start/end dates; review moment)

## E) Safety boundaries
- [ ] Avoids medical advice and does not request sensitive personal health details
- [ ] Includes a redirect for crisis/HR/legal situations
- [ ] Does not ask for secrets/credentials; uses anonymized summaries when needed
