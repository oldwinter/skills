# Templates — Energy Management

Copy/paste these templates into your output. Keep them lightweight and directly usable.

## 0) Energy Management Operating System Pack (skeleton)

### 1) Context snapshot
- Role + scope:
- Time horizon: 2-week pilot + 4–8 week goal:
- Success definition:

- Assumptions:
- Unknowns to validate:

### 2) Energy Drivers & Drains Map
(table)

## 1) Energy Log (after-action tracking)

Use for 7–14 days. Keep it simple.

| Date | Activity / interaction | Context (people + medium) | Before (1–5) | After (1–5) | Δ | Notes (why) | Lever to try |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Quick prompt after an interaction:
- “Did that **give** me energy or **take** energy?”
- “What specifically caused it?” (format, topic, uncertainty, conflict, prep level, audience)

## 2) Energy Drivers & Drains Map

| Item | Driver or drain? | Trigger / pattern | Controllable? (Y/N/Partial) | Lever | Next action (owner + date) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

## 3) Calendar Energy Audit (1 representative week)

### A) Bucket definitions
- **Zone of genius / high leverage:** work that uses your strengths and produces outsized impact.
- **Necessary but neutral:** required maintenance work.
- **Energy drain:** recurring activities that reliably sap energy.
- **Recovery/admin:** buffers, transitions, breaks, decompression.

### B) Time bucket table
| Bucket | Examples from your week | Hours/week | Keep / change |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Zone of genius |  |  |  |
| Necessary but neutral |  |  |  |
| Energy drains |  |  |  |
| Recovery/admin |  |  |  |

### C) “Top offenders” list
List 3–5 items to remove/redesign in the next 2 weeks.
| Offender | Why it drains | Lever (delete/delegate/redesign/time-shift/batch/buffer) | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

## 4) Zone of Genius Expansion Plan (stop/delegate/automate/defer)

| Item | Current owner | Decision (stop / delegate / automate / defer / redesign) | New owner (if any) | Guardrails / escalation triggers | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

## 5) Energy-Aligned Default Week (time blocks)

Assume your day has **high/medium/low** energy windows. Place work accordingly.

| Day | High-energy blocks (deep work/decisions) | Medium-energy blocks (meetings/coaching) | Low-energy blocks (admin/routine) | Buffers/recovery |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mon |  |  |  |  |
| Tue |  |  |  |  |
| Wed |  |  |  |  |
| Thu |  |  |  |  |
| Fri |  |  |  |  |

## 6) Meeting Rules (copy/paste)

Defaults:
- 25/50 minute meetings (unless there’s a reason not to)
- Agenda + desired outcome required
- Decision owner named (if a decision is needed)
- Async pre-read for complex topics; meeting is for debate + decision
- Buffers after high-load meetings (conflict, performance, escalations)

Optional scripts:
- “What decision are we making by the end of this meeting?”
- “Can we do this async? If not, what’s the minimum live time needed?”
- “I can’t make this meeting; please send a summary + decision needed.”

## 7) Recovery + Transition Plan

### A) Buffers (calendar objects)
- Between-meeting buffer:
- Daily decompression block:
- Weekly recovery block:

### B) Micro-recovery menu (pick 3)
- Short walk / movement break
- 2 minutes of breathing + eyes-off-screen
- Water/snack reset
- Quick journaling: “what just happened / next thing”
- Optional remote supports: stand, doodle, fidget, walking call (no medical claims)

### C) Low-energy-day protocol (minimum viable day)
- Non-negotiable 1–2 outcomes:
- What gets postponed:
- Stakeholder message (short):
- Recovery actions:

## 8) 2-Week Pilot + Experiment Tracker

Pick 2–4 experiments max.

| Experiment | Hypothesis | Start date | End date | Measure(s) | Decision rule | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Suggested measures (lightweight):
- End-of-day energy rating (1–5)
- Meeting hours/week + “meeting satisfaction”
- Deep-work blocks/week
- Drain count/day

## 9) Stakeholder boundary message (template)

> “To protect execution quality and sustainability, I’m making a few changes for the next two weeks: [change].  
> If you need [urgent topic], use [channel]. For everything else, please [async process].  
> We’ll review in two weeks and adjust based on outcomes.”
