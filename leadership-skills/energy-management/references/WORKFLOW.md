# Workflow (Expanded) — Energy Management

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance, heuristics, and failure modes.

## Step 1 — Intake + objective + safety boundaries
Aim: avoid generic “self-care” advice; produce an executable plan with boundaries.

Heuristics:
- Define a 4–8 week success definition and a 2-week pilot (you can’t redesign your life in one pass).
- If the user asks for medical guidance, stop and redirect to appropriate help.

Common failure modes:
- Over-personalizing or asking for sensitive health details.
- Treating energy as willpower instead of designing systems (calendar, delegation, norms).

## Step 2 — Baseline energy signals (7-day log + quick retro)
Aim: turn “I feel drained” into observable patterns.

Tactics:
- Use an “after-action” prompt: after a meeting/task, ask “energized or sapped?” and note why.
- Start small: capture the top 10 interactions from last week if calendar detail is missing.

Failure modes:
- Vague drivers/drains (“people”, “work”) instead of specific triggers (format, topic, audience, context switching).

## Step 3 — Drivers & drains map (with levers)
Aim: connect drains to actionable levers.

Example levers:
- **Eliminate:** stop attending or remove low-value meetings.
- **Delegate:** transfer ownership with decision rights and guardrails.
- **Redesign:** change meeting format (async pre-read, clear decision owner, shorter defaults).
- **Time-shift:** move high-load work to high-energy windows.
- **Batch + buffer:** cluster similar work and add transition time.
- **Prepare:** add a 5-minute “pre-brief” to reduce anxiety/uncertainty.
- **Recover:** add a micro-break after high-load interactions.

Failure modes:
- Listing drains without naming the “next action” and owner.

## Step 4 — Calendar audit for zone of genius vs energy tax
Aim: quantify where energy is going.

Bucket guidance:
- **Zone of genius / high leverage:** strategic thinking, coaching, key decisions, creative work.
- **Necessary but neutral:** admin, routine status, predictable ops.
- **Energy drains:** meetings with unclear purpose, constant interruptions, conflict without structure.
- **Recovery/admin:** buffers, breaks, transitions.

Failure modes:
- Treating “busy” as “high leverage”.

## Step 5 — Expand zone of genius (stop/delegate/automate/defer)
Aim: change the mix, not just cope.

Tactics:
- Create a “bottom bucket” list and remove 2 items in the next 2 weeks.
- For delegation: specify outcomes, constraints, escalation triggers, and review points.

Failure modes:
- Offloading without guardrails (causes rework and anxiety).

## Step 6 — Energy-aligned default week + meeting hygiene
Aim: redesign the week so the “best” plan is also the easiest plan.

Meeting hygiene ideas:
- Default to 25/50 minute meetings.
- Require a purpose + agenda + decision owner.
- Batch 1:1s and low-stakes meetings.
- Protect at least one deep-work block in a high-energy window.
- Add buffers between high-load meetings (conflict, performance, customer escalations).

Failure modes:
- Creating a schedule that assumes perfect compliance from everyone else.

## Step 7 — Recovery + transitions + low-energy-day protocol
Aim: build resilience without moralizing.

Tactics:
- Treat recovery as a calendar object (buffer blocks) not an intention.
- For remote work: optional sensory/movement supports (standing, walking calls, doodling/fidgeting) to reduce cognitive load.
- Low-energy-day protocol: define what “minimum viable day” looks like and how to communicate it.

Failure modes:
- Over-indexing on personal optimization while ignoring workload/role design.

## Step 8 — 2-week pilot + measure + iterate
Aim: make the plan testable.

Measurement options (keep lightweight):
- End-of-day energy rating (1–5)
- “Drain count” per day (number of high-drain events)
- Deep-work blocks/week
- Meeting hours/week and “meeting satisfaction”

Decision rules:
- Keep: improves energy with acceptable trade-offs.
- Modify: helps but causes new problems; adjust lever.
- Stop: not worth it; revert and try a different lever.

Failure modes:
- Too many experiments at once (can’t attribute changes).
