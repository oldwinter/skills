# Workflow Notes (How to Run the Review)

Use this file as supporting detail for `SKILL.md`.

## Roles (minimum)
- **Presenter:** walks through the artifact and decisions needed.
- **Facilitator:** keeps time, enforces feedback order, prevents design-by-committee.
- **Sponsor/DRI:** senior owner who focuses on “why”, core concept quality, and final calls.
- **Note-taker:** captures feedback in the log and drafts the follow-up.

## Review types (pick one)
- **Concept review:** Is this direction worth pursuing? (Value-dominant)
- **Flow review:** Does the interaction/system make sense end-to-end? (Ease-dominant)
- **Content review:** Clarity, comprehension, tone, information hierarchy (Value/Ease)
- **Visual polish review:** Craft, aesthetics, consistency (Delight-dominant, but only after Value/Ease)
- **Ship-readiness review:** Edge cases, states, regressions, accessibility (high rigor)

## The feedback hierarchy (enforce this order)
1) **Value:** Does this solve the right problem in a way users will want?
2) **Ease:** Can users do it without confusion, excessive effort, or dead ends?
3) **Delight:** Does it feel great? Is the craft/polish appropriate?

When debates devolve into preferences, pull back to: goal → user → constraint → evidence.

## Agenda templates (timeboxed)

### 30 minutes (tight review)
1) Context + requested feedback (3 min)
2) Live demo (10 min)
3) Feedback capture (12 min)
4) Synthesis + decisions + next steps (5 min)

### 45 minutes (default)
1) Context + requested feedback (5 min)
2) Live demo (15 min)
3) Feedback capture (15 min)
4) Synthesis + decisions + next steps (10 min)

### 60 minutes (complex flow)
1) Context + requested feedback (5 min)
2) Live demo (20 min)
3) Feedback capture (20 min)
4) Synthesis + decisions + next steps (15 min)

## How to prevent “design-by-committee”
- Ask reviewers to state **observations** and **impact** before solutions.
- Require the presenter to restate feedback in their own words before accepting it.
- Timebox solutioning; park deeper explorations as follow-up tasks.
- If feedback conflicts, the Sponsor/DRI decides based on goals and constraints.

## Async review variant (when you can’t meet live)
1) Share the pre-read + a short video walkthrough (optional).
2) Request feedback via 1–3 explicit questions.
3) Require feedback to be logged into the same table (Value/Ease/Delight).
4) Synthesize and circulate a decision record + change plan.
