# Checklists (Quality Gate)

Use these before finalizing the Design Review Pack.

## A) Scope + decision
- [ ] The review type is explicit (concept / flow / content / polish / ship-readiness).
- [ ] The decision needed is explicit (“After this review we will decide ___”).
- [ ] In-scope vs out-of-scope is clear.
- [ ] Target user + JTBD is stated in 1–2 sentences.
- [ ] Success criteria + constraints/guardrails are listed.

## B) Requested feedback (structure)
- [ ] The presenter asked for 1–3 specific feedback questions.
- [ ] Reviewers were told what NOT to focus on yet (avoid premature minutiae).
- [ ] Feedback is prioritized by **Value → Ease → Delight**.

## C) Roles + mechanics
- [ ] Facilitator, Presenter, Note-taker, and Sponsor/DRI are named.
- [ ] Time box and agenda are set.
- [ ] Review is anchored in a live demo (or an async walkthrough) rather than slides.

## D) Feedback capture quality
- [ ] Feedback is recorded as observation + impact (not just preferences).
- [ ] Conflicting feedback is reconciled via goals/constraints (not consensus).
- [ ] The top edge cases/states were considered (loading/empty/error/permissions).

## E) Outcomes + follow-through
- [ ] Top 3 issues are identified and prioritized.
- [ ] Action items have owners + due dates.
- [ ] Decisions and tradeoffs are documented.
- [ ] A follow-up message is ready to send.

## F) Finalization
- [ ] Risks, open questions, and next steps are included at the end.
- [ ] No secrets/credentials were requested or recorded.
