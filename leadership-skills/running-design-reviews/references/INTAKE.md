# Intake (Question Bank)

Ask up to **5** questions at a time. If information is missing, proceed with explicit assumptions and label them.

## If you can only answer 5, answer these
1) What is the **decision** we need from this review (what changes after)?
2) What is **in scope** (which flow/screens/states) and what is out of scope?
3) Who is the **target user** and what job are they trying to get done?
4) What stage is this design in: concept / flow / polish / ship-ready?
5) What kind of feedback do you want: Value / Ease / Delight (or which risks/tradeoffs)?

## Context
- What problem are we solving and why now?
- What are the 1–3 success criteria? Any guardrails (a11y, performance, legal, brand)?
- What constraints matter most (timeline, platform, tech limitations, content readiness)?

## Artifacts
- Link(s) to design artifact(s) (Figma/prototype) or share screenshots.
- What should reviewers look at first (start state / happy path / key edge case)?
- Which states are included: loading/empty/error/permissions/offline?
- Any known unknowns / areas of uncertainty?

## Review mechanics
- Live review or async? Time box (30/45/60 min)?
- Who’s attending and what are their roles?
- Who is the **Sponsor/DRI** (senior owner for “why” + core concept)?
- Who will take notes and own follow-up?

## Requested feedback (make it explicit)
- What 1–3 questions should reviewers answer?
  - “Is the value proposition clear?”
  - “Where does the flow break or feel confusing?”
  - “What edge cases are missing?”
  - “What is the biggest risk/tradeoff?”
- What should reviewers **not** focus on yet (e.g., visual polish, microcopy)?

## Quality bar / ship gate
- Is this a “must-review all screens” product area (high craft / founder-led quality bar)?
- Do we need a final “screen-by-screen” pass before shipping?
