# Checklists (Managing Timelines)

Use these before finalizing the Timeline Management Pack.

## 1) Deadline & commitment checklist
- Date type is explicit (fixed external / fixed internal / target / window).
- “Why now” is stated in 1–2 sentences.
- Commitment ladder (commit/forecast/target) is defined and used consistently.
- The plan states what variable can move (scope/resources/quality/date).
- Confidence level is stated with top risks and the next re-forecast checkpoint.

## 2) Phase plan checklist
- Discovery/Solutioning/Build/Launch phases are defined with clear outputs.
- Each phase has a decision gate (what must be true to proceed).
- Commitments are made only for phases within control; later dates are forecasts/targets.
- Dependencies/approvals are reflected in phase outputs (not hidden).

## 3) Milestone tracker + RAG checklist
- Milestones are deliverables, not vague activities.
- Every milestone has an owner and dependency notes (if any).
- RAG definitions are written and action-oriented.
- Yellow/red statuses map to explicit asks/decisions with deadlines.

## 4) Governance + cadence checklist
- Update cadence is defined (weekly default) and includes a forum for decisions.
- Weekly review agenda is included and short enough to run consistently.
- Escalation path is clear: who decides scope/date/resource trade-offs.
- A decision log exists (or a place to record decisions is specified).

## 5) Scope & change-control checklist (deadline protection)
- Non-goals are explicit.
- A cut list exists (pre-traded options) and is ordered (cut first → cut next).
- Freeze points are defined (as appropriate).
- Change control rule is stated (“trade, don’t add”) with a decision owner.
- The plan states what work gets deprioritized if the deadline is P0.

## 6) AI/ML outer-loop checklist (only if applicable)
- Demo vs production-ready are treated as separate milestones.
- Evaluation metrics + acceptance bar exist.
- Safety/guardrails + fallback behavior are defined.
- Monitoring + incident/runbook + rollback plan are included.

## 7) Finalization checklist
- The pack includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, and **Next steps** with owners + dates.
- A stakeholder could approve the plan async (it’s readable, specific, and unambiguous).
