# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → Skill Pack)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/building-team-culture/SKILL.md`

## What was preserved

The original skill was insight-heavy. This pack translates the key insights into rules, checks, and concrete artifacts:

1) **Build trust through active listening (Katie Dill)**  
Converted to: a “listen first” workflow step + listening tour prompts + requirement that the culture snapshot uses evidence/examples.

2) **Fight cultural stagnation with visible progress and ambition (Kayvon Beykpour)**  
Converted to: diagnose “stagnation” explicitly; include rituals that make progress visible (demos, shipping reviews, customer impact reviews); identify sacred cows that block evolution.

3) **Coaching model over traditional management (Cam Adams)**  
Converted to: rollout/reinforcement plan includes a lightweight coaching model (peer or craft coaches) focused on skill growth and career trajectory.

4) **Culture as decentralized decision-making guide (Chip Conley)**  
Converted to: culture code includes decision rules and anti-patterns; norms specify how decisions are made and documented.

5) **Articulate existing culture vs inventing from scratch (Dharmesh Shah)**  
Converted to: “articulate before you invent” principle; culture code is grounded in what already works, with explicit decisions on what to change.

## What was added (to make it executable)
- Explicit **input/output contracts** and a 7-step workflow
- Copy/paste **templates** for culture snapshot, culture code, norms, rituals, rollout, measurement
- **Checklists + rubric** as quality gates
- Safety boundary for HR/legal risk situations
