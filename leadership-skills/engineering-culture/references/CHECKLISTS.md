# Quality Checklist (Engineering Culture Operating System Pack)

Use this checklist before finalizing.

## 1) Scope + boundaries
- [ ] “When to use” and “When NOT to use” are explicit and practical.
- [ ] The scope (team vs org) is clear and a decision owner is identified.
- [ ] The pack avoids HR/legal policy advice and incident-response operational guidance.

## 2) Evidence-based diagnosis
- [ ] Symptoms include 2–5 concrete examples (anonymized) or are clearly marked as assumptions.
- [ ] A capability map is included (technical, architectural, cultural, management/lean).
- [ ] Stated culture vs lived culture is distinguished.

## 3) Culture code quality
- [ ] 3–7 principles only (not a long list).
- [ ] Each principle has behaviors (do/don’t), decision rules, and anti-patterns.
- [ ] Each principle has at least one observable/measurable signal.

## 4) Conway’s Law + operating model
- [ ] Org↔architecture misalignments are documented with evidence.
- [ ] Proposed changes include transition steps and trade-offs.
- [ ] Standardization items are separated into “required” vs “optional” (if applicable).

## 5) Clock speed + DevEx plan
- [ ] Clock speed targets and guardrails are explicit.
- [ ] Backlog items have owners, effort ranges, dependencies, and leading indicators.
- [ ] At least 1–2 “start this week” actions are included.

## 6) Cross-functional workflow contract
- [ ] Workflow describes how work moves issue → PR → deploy → learn.
- [ ] Review SLAs, escalation paths, and merge/deploy policy are defined.
- [ ] Non-engineer participation is explicit (either enabled with rails or explicitly out of scope).
- [ ] AI-assisted development norms include required human checks and “no silent changes.”

## 7) Rollout + measurement
- [ ] Includes a 30/60/90 plan with owners.
- [ ] Includes rituals/cadence with output artifacts.
- [ ] Includes metrics + guardrails and lists instrumentation gaps.

## 8) Required close-out
- [ ] Includes **Risks**, **Open questions**, and **Next steps**.
- [ ] Trade-offs are stated (what might get worse).
- [ ] The pack is internally consistent (principles ↔ workflows ↔ metrics).
