# Source Summary (Refound/Lenny → Engineering Culture)

This skill pack was derived from `sources/refound/raw/engineering-culture/SKILL.md` and converts its insights into an execution contract with concrete deliverables.

## Core source insights preserved

1) **DevOps is capabilities, not a toolchain (Nicole Forsgren).**  
Converted into the capability model (technical, architectural, cultural, management/lean) and a required capability map + evidence-based gaps.

2) **You ship your org structure (Conway’s Law) (Dhanji R. Prasanna).**  
Converted into an Org ↔ Architecture Alignment Brief with misalignment analysis, proposed boundary/interface changes, and policy standardization.

3) **Engineers shift from bricklayer to architect (Scott Wu).**  
Converted into explicit AI-assisted development norms and “spec/review/oversight” expectations in the workflow contract.

4) **Optimize for clock speed (Albert Cheng / Duolingo).**  
Converted into clock speed targets, bottleneck mapping, and a prioritized improvement backlog with safety guardrails.

5) **Strong technical culture includes shared toolchain participation (Brandon Chu).**  
Converted into a cross-functional workflow contract that defines how non-engineers contribute safely within engineering workflows.

## What was added (to make it agent-executable)
- A clear input/output contract, 7-step workflow, templates, checklist, and rubric.
- A measurement plan with metrics and guardrails, plus rollout/reinforcement rituals.
