# Workflow Notes (expanded guidance)

This file helps tailor the ritual system to team size, stage, and work mode.

## Core insights → design rules

### 1) Rituals are the engine (not “meeting management”)
- Treat rituals as the mechanisms that produce alignment, decisions, learning, and belonging.
- Prefer **artifact-first** rituals: every ritual produces a reusable output (priorities, decisions, action list, learnings).
- Include “micro-rituals” (async patterns) in addition to meetings when possible.

### 2) Golden Rituals are small, named, templated, and widely known
- Keep the Golden Ritual list **small** (usually 3–7).
- **Named:** memorable names people can reference (“Bring this to <RitualName>”).
- **Templated:** a consistent agenda/notes format stored in a known place.
- **Known by first Friday:** onboarding makes rituals legible to every new hire quickly.

## Design principles (defaults)

1) **Minimize meeting load**
- Start from a weekly sync-time budget and design within it.
- Replace status meetings with async updates when feasible.

2) **Make ownership explicit**
- Every ritual has an owner responsible for prep, facilitation, and outputs.
- Shared ownership is allowed, but the “single throat to choke” is clear.

3) **Separate alignment vs decisions vs execution**
- Avoid mixing multiple meeting “jobs” into one ritual.
- Example: don’t do status + brainstorming + decision-making in a single weekly meeting.

4) **Make outputs real**
- Define what the ritual produces: a decision, a ranked list, a risk register, an action tracker, a retro log.
- Track follow-ups in the system the team actually uses (docs, tickets, tasks).

5) **Default to async-friendly**
- Provide async participation paths (prework prompts, doc-first agendas, recordings, summaries).
- Rotate times if time zones are spread; do not require everyone live for everything.

## Common categories of Golden Rituals (choose what you need)

- **Alignment:** weekly priorities, focus review, roadmap/goal check
- **Decisions:** decision review, trade-off forum, escalation ritual
- **Execution:** sprint planning/checkpoint, execution review, dependency sync
- **Learning:** retro, pre-mortem/post-mortem, customer/quality review
- **Belonging:** team demo/show-and-tell, wins/gratitude, office hours

## Tailoring: by stage

### Early stage (small team, fast iteration)
- Keep rituals minimal and bias to async.
- Pick 3–4 Golden Rituals; avoid heavy process.

### Scaling (10–50 people across functions)
- Prioritize decision velocity + dependency management.
- Make ritual outputs consistent and discoverable; add explicit owners.

### Turnaround / low trust
- Start with rituals that rebuild trust: predictable updates, clear decisions, and a learning cadence.
- Avoid “gotcha” accountability rituals; focus on transparency and support.

## Anti-patterns (avoid)

1) **Ritual sprawl**
- Too many recurring meetings; no one knows why they exist.
2) **No templates**
- Meetings vary wildly; outputs disappear.
3) **Status-only rituals**
- Lots of talking; no decisions, no commitments, no learning.
4) **Surveillance disguised as process**
- Rituals used to police individuals; people disengage and information quality drops.

## Governance (keep it healthy)

- Set a **quarterly ritual review**: kill/change/keep, based on outcomes and time budget.
- Maintain a **single ritual index** (table) so the operating system is discoverable.
- Use a lightweight feedback loop (1–3 questions monthly) to spot issues early.
