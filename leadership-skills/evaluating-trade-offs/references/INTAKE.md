# Intake Questions (pick 3–5 at a time)

## 1) Decision framing
1) What is the trade-off / decision in one sentence?
2) By when do you need a decision (and who is the decider)?
3) Why now—what changed, and what happens if you don’t decide?

## 2) Options + constraints
4) What options are on the table (2–4)? Include “do nothing” if plausible.
5) What are the constraints/non-negotiables (budget, headcount, policy, deadline, customer commitments)?
6) What are the major dependencies or “gotchas” (tech, legal, partner, platform)?

## 3) What you’re optimizing for
7) What does success look like (1–3 metrics) and what guardrails matter (trust, reliability, cost, support load)?
8) What time horizon matters most (weeks, quarter, year, 3 years)?
9) What do you explicitly *not* want to optimize for in this decision?

## 4) Costs, resources, and opportunity cost
10) What resources are available (team size, key roles, budget)? Any hard capacity constraints?
11) What is the “all-in” cost for each option (build/maintain, process, coordination, tools, ongoing ops)?
12) What do you stop/defer if you choose Option A vs Option B (opportunity cost)?

## 5) Evidence + uncertainty
13) What evidence do you already have (data, customer feedback, past attempts)?
14) What are the biggest unknowns/assumptions that would change the decision?
15) How reversible is this choice (easy to roll back vs hard to undo)?

## 6) Output preferences
16) Who is the audience (execs, team, cross-functional)? Any confidentiality constraints?
17) Do you want a quick decision (good-enough) or a higher-rigor evaluation (and why)?
