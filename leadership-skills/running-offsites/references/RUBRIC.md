# Running Offsites — Scoring Rubric

Score each item 0/1/2:
- 0 = missing / unusable
- 1 = present but incomplete
- 2 = clear, runnable, and likely to produce good outcomes

Suggested passing bar: **>= 16/20**.

## 1) Scope + boundaries (0–2)
- Clear when to use and when not to use; conflict/HR boundaries are explicit.

## 2) Input contract (0–2)
- Minimum inputs are explicit; missing-info strategy is followed (ask 3–5 questions max).

## 3) Outputs are artifact-first (0–2)
- Deliverables are concrete and checkable; output order is defined.

## 4) Agenda quality (0–2)
- Agenda is timed, interactive-heavy, and every block has an output artifact.

## 5) “Defrag the day” (0–2)
- Distraction controls exist (laptops down, scribe pattern, breaks, physical tools).

## 6) Prework protects time (0–2)
- Prework gathers inputs and reduces context-setting during the offsite.

## 7) Facilitation runnable (0–2)
- Run-of-show includes opening, norms, decision capture, and disagreement handling.

## 8) Logistics frictionless (0–2)
- Logistics checklist is complete, including accessibility and contingencies; bursts have repeatable ops.

## 9) Memory + follow-through (0–2)
- Post-offsite pack includes decisions, action plan, comms, and checkpoint scheduling.

## 10) Safety + realism (0–2)
- Avoids forced vulnerability; escalates appropriately for conflict/HR/legal.
