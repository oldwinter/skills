# Running Offsites — Examples

These are prompts you can give an agent using this skill, plus what “good” looks like.

## Example 1 — 1-day laptops-down strategy offsite

**Prompt**
“Plan a 1-day strategy offsite for a 10-person product team (remote-first). We need to decide Q2 priorities and reset working agreements. Budget is moderate; location is NYC. Output the full Offsite Pack.”

**What good looks like**
- Offsite Brief with 3–7 explicit outputs (e.g., Q2 bets, decision principles, working agreements, action plan)
- Timed agenda with laptops-down co-creation blocks and explicit artifacts per session
- Prework that gathers proposals/risks ahead of time
- Run-of-show that includes decision capture, disagreement handling, and a closing plan
- Post-offsite decision log + action plan + checkpoint date

## Example 2 — Quarterly “burst” cadence for a distributed team

**Prompt**
“We’re a distributed team across PST/EST/UK. Design a quarterly 2-day burst cadence and a default burst agenda that balances connection and deep work. Include repeatable logistics and post-burst follow-through.”

**What good looks like**
- Burst Program Plan (frequency, objectives, budget, repeatable ops)
- Default burst agenda with Day 1 connection + divergence and Day 2 convergence + commitment
- Logistics checklist that can be reused each quarter
- Post-burst comms and checkpoint plan

## Boundary example — conflict masquerading as ‘workshop request’

**Prompt**
“Run a storytelling workshop to fix our leadership team’s distrust and resentment.”

**What good looks like**
- Call out that workshops won’t fix trust debt
- Recommend conflict repair/mediation (or leadership/HR involvement) first
- Offer a redesigned offsite focused on safer outputs (working agreements, decision norms) only after trust work
