# Source summary (Refound / Lenny)

Source: `sources/refound/raw/setting-okrs-goals/SKILL.md`

This skill pack preserves the core insights and converts them into executable rules, checks, and artifacts:

## Preserved insights → rules

1) **OKRs create cadence, alignment, and a learning cycle** (Christina Wodtke)
   - Rule: Define a weekly review cadence and an end-of-cycle grading + retro.
   - Check: The pack specifies who reviews, when, what can change mid-cycle, and what is learned at the end.
   - Artifact: Review + grading plan.

2) **Be obsessed with the system, not just the goal** (Lane Shackleton)
   - Rule: Every objective must include at least one “default-on” system/habit.
   - Check: Each system has an owner, cadence, and evidence captured.
   - Artifact: Systems & habits plan.

3) **Team goals should be no more than one step away from company goals** (Matt LeMay)
   - Rule: Create an explicit alignment map; avoid deep cascading.
   - Check: Each objective can answer “how does this move the company goal this cycle?”
   - Artifact: Alignment map.

4) **Ratios/percentages are dangerous because they can be gamed** (Archie Abrams)
   - Rule: Prefer absolute metrics; if using ratios, add numerator/denominator checks and guardrails.
   - Check: Each ratio KR includes anti-gaming notes and complementary absolute measures.
   - Artifact: Anti-gaming + guardrails section.

5) **Ambitious goals force different thinking** (Daniel Lereya)
   - Rule: Include an ambition check (conservative/base/ambitious options) and document assumptions.
   - Check: Targets can’t be achieved by “working harder” alone; systems/approach changes are specified.
   - Artifact: Option sets + “why this is ambitious” rationale.

## What was added (to make it agent-executable)
- An explicit input/output contract
- A step-by-step workflow
- Copy/paste templates, checklists, and a scoring rubric
