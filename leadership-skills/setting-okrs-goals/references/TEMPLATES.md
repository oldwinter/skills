# Templates (Copy/Paste)

Use these templates to produce the **OKR & Goals Pack**.

## 0) Context snapshot (bullets)
- Cycle + horizon:
- Team(s) in scope:
- Strategy anchor (company goal / North Star / why now):
- Baselines + data sources:
- Constraints (capacity/commitments/dependencies/deadlines):
- Stakeholders (decider/contributors/approvers):
- Non-goals (if known):
- Notes / assumptions:

## 1) Alignment map (company goal → team objectives)
| Company goal / North Star | Team objective | Why this is “one step away” | Primary metric(s) it should influence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

## 2) OKRs (Objectives + Key Results)

### Objective template
**Objective:** <short, memorable outcome statement>  
**Why now:** <2–4 bullets>  
**How this supports the company goal:** <1–2 sentences>  
**Primary owner:** <team/person>  

### Key Results table (per objective)
| KR | Metric definition (unambiguous) | Baseline | Target | Window | Owner | Data source | Type (absolute/ratio) | Anti-gaming note | Guardrails |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | | | | |

**If using a ratio KR**, also include at least one of:
- Absolute numerator KR (volume), and/or
- Denominator health guardrail, and/or
- A second KR that protects volume/quality.

## 3) Systems & habits plan (“default-on”)
List the recurring mechanisms that will produce progress (not just one-off initiatives).

| System/habit (default-on) | Cadence | Owner | What it changes | Evidence/output captured |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

## 4) Review + grading plan (learning loop)

### Weekly OKR review (30–45 min)
Agenda:
1) Metric check (what moved, what didn’t) — 10 min
2) What changed in the world (signals, launches, incidents) — 10 min
3) Decide: what to stop/start/adjust this week — 15 min
4) Risks/blocks + owners — 5 min

Artifacts:
- Updated KR status (on-track/off-track)
- Decision log (1–3 bullets)

### Mid-cycle checkpoint (60–90 min)
Decisions allowed:
- Drop/replace a KR if it’s unmeasurable or proven irrelevant
- Adjust targets if baselines were wrong (document why)
- Add a guardrail if gaming/harm appears

### End-of-cycle grading (60–90 min)
Score each KR:
- **0.0** = no progress
- **0.3** = some progress
- **0.7** = meaningful progress
- **1.0** = achieved

Retro prompts:
- What got in the way?
- What would we do differently next cycle?
- Which “systems” helped most (or were missing)?
- What did we learn about the strategy assumptions?

## 5) Risks / Open questions / Next steps (required)
