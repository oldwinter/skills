# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with extra guidance and heuristics.

## Step 1 — Intake + decision framing
Goal: set the frame so OKRs become a tool for alignment + learning.

Outputs:
- A **Context snapshot** (cycle, scope, strategy anchor, baselines, constraints, stakeholders)
- A stated OKR intent: “OKRs are for focus + learning, not performance evaluation.”

Common failure mode: jumping into writing KRs before agreeing on the strategy anchor and baseline reality.

## Step 2 — Establish alignment (“one step away”)
Rule of thumb: a team objective should be **no more than one step removed** from the company goal.

Practical test:
- If you need a 5-layer goal cascade chart to explain the link, it’s too far.

Output:
- An **Alignment map** that explicitly traces each objective back to the company goal/North Star.

## Step 3 — Draft 1–3 Objectives
Good objectives:
- Are outcomes, not project lists
- Are memorable and directional
- Change weekly prioritization

Heuristics:
- Keep it to 1–3 objectives per team per quarter.
- Prefer “customer value” language over internal activity.

Output:
- Objective statements + “why now / why this” rationale.

## Step 4 — Generate candidate KRs (make measurement unambiguous)
Good KRs:
- Include a baseline + a target + a time window
- Have a clear owner and data source
- Are hard to game

Ratio warning (common failure mode):
- Conversion rates/percentages can improve by shrinking the denominator.
- If you include a ratio KR, add:
  - The **absolute numerator** (volume) and/or
  - A **denominator health** guardrail, and
  - A short “how this could be gamed” note.

Output:
- KR tables with metric specs and anti-gaming notes.

## Step 5 — Add systems/habits (default-on execution)
Principle: don’t be obsessed with the goal; be obsessed with the system that gets you there.

Examples of “default-on” systems:
- Weekly customer interviews (fixed slot)
- Weekly funnel review + experiment selection
- A release train with a consistent QA gate
- A recurring “quality debt” allocation

Output:
- Systems/habits plan with owners + cadence + evidence captured.

## Step 6 — Anti-gaming + guardrails
Guardrails should prevent:
- Quality regressions
- Trust/safety harm
- Margin destruction
- Perverse incentives (e.g., shrinking denominator to “improve” a ratio)

Output:
- Guardrails section + per-KR failure modes + detection plan.

## Step 7 — Review cadence + grading plan (learning loop)
Cadence recommendation (quarterly):
- Weekly: health check (are we on track? what changed?)
- Mid-cycle: checkpoint (what to stop/start/adjust based on learning?)
- End: grade KRs + capture what blocked progress + define next-cycle changes

Grading guidance:
- Use grades to learn, not punish.
- Write down what you learned and what you’ll change next cycle.

Output:
- A concrete review agenda and grading method.

## Step 8 — Quality gate + finalize
Run [CHECKLISTS.md](CHECKLISTS.md) + [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md), then finalize with:
- Risks (what could go wrong / what might we be wrong about)
- Open questions (what would change the OKRs)
- Next steps (owners + dates if possible)
