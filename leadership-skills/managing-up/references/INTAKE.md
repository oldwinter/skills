# Intake (Question Bank)

Use this to gather the minimum information required to produce a Managing Up Operating System Pack. Ask **3–5 questions at a time**.

## 1) Your context + goals
1) What’s your role/scope and what are your top 1–3 priorities for the next 4–8 weeks?
2) What does “better managing up” mean for you (more autonomy, fewer surprises, faster decisions, more influence, clearer boundaries)?
3) What constraints exist (confidentiality/PII rules, HR policies, time zones, meeting load, upcoming deadlines)?

## 2) Your manager / leader context
4) Who are you managing up to (title/level) and what decisions do they control?
5) Relationship stage: new, stable, strained? What are 2–5 concrete friction examples?
6) How does your manager prefer communication today (async vs meetings, detail level, format)?

## 3) Work + stakeholder environment
7) What are the key stakeholders beyond your manager (execs, peers, cross-functional leads)?
8) Where do decisions happen today (forums, weekly meetings, docs)? What’s currently unclear or slow?

## 4) Communication + cadence
9) Do you have a standing 1:1? If yes, cadence/length/agenda? If no, what’s the alternative?
10) What’s your current update format (if any)? What feedback have you received about it?

## 5) Escalation + boundaries
11) What are the most common blockers you face (resourcing, alignment, dependencies, decision rights)?
12) Any boundary issues (late-night requests, scope creep, urgency inflation)? What’s the pattern?

## 6) Influence / “seat at the table”
13) What kind of influence do you want (strategy input, roadmap decisions, resourcing, visibility)?
14) What forums could you contribute to (leadership meeting, product review, QBR), and what’s your current access?
