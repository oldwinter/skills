# Intake — Running Decision Processes

Ask up to 5 questions at a time. If answers aren’t available, proceed with explicit assumptions and label unknowns.

## Core framing
1) What is the decision, in one sentence (include what will change)?
2) What is the deadline (and what happens if we don’t decide)?
3) Is this a **one-way door** (hard to reverse) or **two-way door** (reversible)? If unsure, what’s the worst credible failure?

## Success + constraints
4) What does “good” look like (success metrics, acceptance criteria, customer impact)?
5) What are the non-negotiables (budget, timeline, policy/compliance/security, brand, customer promises)?

## Stakeholders + decision rights
6) Who is the **Decider** (or decision body)? Who can veto/block?
7) Who must be consulted vs merely informed? Any sensitive stakeholders (Legal, Security, Finance)?

## Options + tradeoffs
8) What options are currently on the table? Any “must include” option (e.g., do nothing, delay)?
9) What are the top 2–3 uncertainties/assumptions driving the decision?
10) What are the evaluation criteria (cost, speed, risk, customer value, strategic fit, reversibility)?

## History + context (historian pass)
11) Have we made a similar decision before? What happened and why?
12) Is there “baggage” (past failures, political constraints, strong opinions) we should surface explicitly?

## Process design
13) What level of rigor is appropriate (light/standard/heavy) given stakes and reversibility?
14) Do we prefer an async pre-read + short meeting, or a single live workshop?
15) Who should be in the curiosity loop (8–12 people) for contextual advice?
