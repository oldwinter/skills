# Workflow (Expanded)

This file expands the steps from `../SKILL.md` with heuristics and default moves.

## Principles (from the source skill)
- **Care personally + challenge directly** (Radical Candor): be humane *and* unambiguous.
- **Hope + a path** for disappointing news (e.g., promotion denial): provide concrete next steps and support.
- **Deliver high-stakes news privately and personally**: for layoffs/terminations, dignity requires a private 1:1 (never email/group chat).
- **Separate feelings from attributions**: “I felt disappointed” is a feeling; “I feel you don’t care” is a story/label.
- **Feedback is a practice, not an event**: the follow-up system matters as much as the script.

## Step 1 — Intake + boundaries
Heuristics:
- Classify the request into one of these lanes:
  - **Behavior change** (feedback/coaching)
  - **Decision delivery** (promotion denial, role change, re-org)
  - **Separation** (layoff/termination)
- If the request involves policy, legal risk, or investigation: **stop** and route to HR/legal.

## Step 2 — Outcome + non-negotiables
Defaults:
- Define two outcomes:
  - **Immediate:** “They understand the message and next steps.”
  - **Lagging (2–4 weeks):** “Behavior X changes; milestone Y is met; trust is repaired.”
- Write the non-negotiable as a crisp sentence you can repeat:
  - “You are not being promoted this cycle.”
  - “This behavior needs to change by <date>.”
  - “Your employment ends on <date>.” (Only if confirmed by HR/process.)

## Step 3 — Facts, not labels
Tools:
- Use **Observation → Impact → Request** (or Situation → Behavior → Impact) to prevent vague feedback.
- Prefer 2–5 examples over a long list. Too many examples becomes “kitchen-sinking.”

Anti-patterns:
- “You’re not a leader.” (label)
- “I feel like you don’t care.” (attribution)

Better:
- “In the last 3 sprints, tickets X/Y/Z were delivered 5–10 days late without escalation. That caused partner teams to miss their dates. Going forward, I need <specific request>…”

## Step 4 — Message map (build the spine)
Recommended structure:
1) **Opening + intent:** direct + caring, set the tone.
2) **Key message:** the core truth in 1–2 sentences (no hedging).
3) **Evidence:** 2–5 concrete examples.
4) **Impact:** why it matters (team/customer).
5) **Ask/decision:** what changes / what’s decided.
6) **Support:** what help you will provide.
7) **Boundaries:** what is not up for debate; what happens if nothing changes.
8) **Close:** summarize + next step.

For promotion denial:
- Add **hope + a path**:
  - “Here’s what would need to be true for the next level.”
  - “Here’s the plan and how I’ll support you.”
  - “Here’s when we’ll revisit.”

## Step 5 — Talk track (write it like you’ll say it)
Guidance:
- Write short sentences. Avoid long explanations.
- Add planned **pauses** after the key message.
- Create 2–3 “anchor phrases” you can repeat if they argue:
  - “I hear you. The decision is <X>. Let’s focus on next steps.”
  - “I’m going to stay on the core message here.”

## Step 6 — Logistics + dignity
Rules of thumb:
- Private setting, adequate time, no interruptions.
- Prefer video/in-person for emotionally loaded conversations; don’t do it via text.
- For layoffs/terminations, follow policy and coordinate with HR:
  - You can be compassionate, but don’t improvise policy.

## Step 7 — Emotion handling (what to do when it gets hard)
Default moves (in order):
1) **Pause** (silence is allowed).
2) **Name + acknowledge emotion** (“I can see this is upsetting.”).
3) **Listen + reflect** (summarize what you heard).
4) **Clarify** (ask 1 question).
5) **Return to the core message** (don’t debate reality).
6) **Next steps** (what happens now, by when).

Feelings vs stories:
- Replace: “I feel you’re being insensitive.”
- With: “When <observation>, I felt <feeling>. I need <request>.”

## Step 8 — Follow-up system (make it real)
For behavior-change conversations:
- Send a summary within 24 hours:
  - what you observed
  - what you agreed will change
  - support you’ll provide
  - the next check-in date
- Create a check-in cadence (weekly for 2–4 weeks by default).

For decision delivery (promotion denial):
- Send a short recap + growth plan milestones + review date.

For separation:
- Follow HR/policy for documentation and communications. Keep the message factual and minimal.
