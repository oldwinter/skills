# Source Summary (What was preserved)

This skill pack was derived from the Refound/Lenny source skill: `sources/refound/raw/having-difficult-conversations/SKILL.md` (Category: Leadership).

## What the original skill emphasized (key insights)
- **Provide hope + a path** when delivering disappointing news (e.g., promotion denial).
- **Radical Candor**: care personally and challenge directly at the same time.
- **Layoffs/terminations should be delivered personally in a private 1:1**, not via email or public channels.
- **Distinguish feelings from attributions** to keep feedback clean and actionable.
- **Feedback is a continuous practice**, not a rare event.

## How those insights became executable artifacts
- Insights were converted into:
  - a concrete **Difficult Conversation Pack** output contract
  - a step-by-step **workflow** with checks
  - copy/paste **templates** (brief, message map, script, reaction plan, follow-up note)
  - **checklists** and a **rubric** to gate quality and reduce risk
